276,"Treatment of locally advanced, high-grade, malignant tumors of major salivary glands A retrospective review of 45 patients with Stage III and IV malignant tumors of the major salivary glands was undertaken to determine tumor control and patient survival after treatment with surgery and conventional ionizing-radiation therapy. Eight of the 23 patients received early postoperative radiotherapy after initial surgical resection, with a local control rate of 75%. Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%. Patients were also analyzed according to the extent of surgical resection prior to radiation therapy and according to radiation dose. Eighty-eight percent of completely resected, 50% of partially resected, and 44% of unresected tumors were locally controlled for an overall local control rate of 61%. The 5-year survival rate was significantly higher for patients with local tumor control than for patients who failed locally (31% vs. 0%).",Excluded
1305,"Response Evaluation of Choroidal Melanoma After Brachytherapy Using Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI): Preliminary Findings Purpose: To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in the assessment of therapeutic response in patients with choroidal melanoma treated with brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a prospective, unicentric study which included patients with choroidal melanoma and indication for brachytherapy. Three DW-MRI examinations were proposed for each patient, one before and two after treatment. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated on DW-MRI and compared with local tumor control assessed by ophthalmologic follow-up. Result(s): From 07/2018 to 06/2019, 19 patients were recruited, 13 of whom underwent follow-up examinations. Patients' ages ranged from 24 to 78 years and 52.9% were male. At the ocular ultrasound, the mean tumor thickness and diameter were 6.3 and 11.5 mm, respectively. Two patients (15.4%) showed signs of tumor progression during follow-up (7 and 9 months after treatment). There was no statistically significant difference in tumor size between MR before and after treatment, however, there was a significant reduction in mean ADC in patients with progression (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI is a promising method for monitoring patients with choroidal melanoma; reduction in the mean ADC values between pre-treatment MRI and the first post-treatment MRI may be related to the lack of response to brachytherapy and increased risk of disease progression.© Copyright © 2020 Bitencourt, Bitencourt, Chojniak, Souza, Castro, Pellizzon and Chojniak.",Excluded
3054,"Successful introduction of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention system into Japanese clinical practice: a first-year survey at single center In Japan, a robotic-assisted PCI (R-PCI) system, the CorPath GRX System (Corindus Inc.), has been approved for clinical use in 2018, which is the first introduction of R-PCI into Japan. In this study, the clinical performance of the R-PCI system in the initial year at Kurume University Hospital was evaluated comparing with conventional manual PCI (M-PCI). A total of 30 R-PCI and 77 M-PCI procedures performed between April 2019 and March 2020, were retrospectively included. The primary outcome was the rate of clinical success defined as < 30% residual stenosis without in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The secondary outcomes were fluoroscopy time, dose area product (DAP), amount of radiation exposure to operators and assistants, procedural time, and contrast volume. Propensity-matching technique was used to match each R-PCI lesion to the nearest M-PCI lesion without replacement. After propensity score matching, 30 R-PCI procedures in 28 patients and 37 M-PCI procedures in 35 patients were analyzed. Clinical success rate with R-PCI was favorable and comparable to M-PCI (93.3 vs. 94.6%, p = 0.97), without any in-hospital MACE. The operator radiation exposure was significantly lower in R-PCI (0 vs. 24.5 microSV, p < 0.0001). Radiation exposure to the patients was tended to be reduced by R-PCI (DAP: 77.6 vs. 100.2 Gycm2, p = 0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in radiation exposure to the assistant, fluoroscopy time, procedural time and contrast volume between the two groups (radiation exposure to the assistant: 10.5 vs. 10.0 microSV, p = 0.64, fluoroscopy time: 27.5 vs. 30.1 min, p = 0.55, procedural time: 72.4 vs. 61.6 min, p = 0.23, and contrast volume: 93.2 vs. 102.0 ml, p = 0.36). R-PCI in selected patients demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes with dramatical reduction of radiation exposure to operators.Copyright © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2718,"Current psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety remain high for those who have rebuilt permanent homes following the Fukushima nuclear disaster Objective: The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 produced psychological reactions among evacuees. Despite the harsh situation, subsequently, there has been gradual progress in reconstruction, with more than half of the evacuees returning after the evacuation. Our hypothesis is that evacuee mental health will now be better due to new stable living conditions. This study aims to clarify the statuses of psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety among evacuees who have rebuilt permanent homes after evacuation. Method(s): A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 1600 residents was conducted in 2020. As primary outcomes, the survey measured psychological distress (Kessler 6), post-traumatic stress (post-traumatic stress four-item checklist), and radiation health anxiety. The data are compared for residents who have rebuilt permanent home and those who did not evacuate. Result(s): In the co-variant analysis, the statuses of psychological distress (p < 0.001), post-traumatic stress (p < 0.001), and radiation health anxiety (p < 0.001) are found to still be high, with significant differences when compared to those who did not evacuate. These results are still at an equivalent level for the continuing evacuation. Conclusion(s): Our findings may indicate a necessity for continuing disaster-related mental health activities even though the living conditions have improved.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

2552,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included

492,"Case-control study on radiology work, medical x-ray investigations, and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors CONTEXT: Ionizing radiation is a well-established risk factor for brain tumors. During recent years, microwave exposure from the use of cellular telephones has been discussed as a potential risk factor., OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for brain tumors., DESIGN: A case-control study, with exposure assessed by questionnaires., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 233 currently living men and women, aged 20 to 80 years, were included. The case patients had histopathologically verified brain tumors and lived in the Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-1996) or the Stockholm region (1995-1996). Two matched controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ionizing radiation and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors., RESULTS: A total of 209 cases (90%) and 425 controls (91%) answered the questionnaire. Work as a physician yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 6.00, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62 to 57.7. All three case patients had worked with fluoroscopy. Radiotherapy of the head and neck region yielded an OR of 3.61 (95% CI, 0.65-19.9). Medical diagnostic x-ray examination of the same area yielded an OR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.25-3.53), with a tumor induction period of 5 years or more. Chemical industry work yielded an OR of 4.10 (95% CI, 1.25-13.4), and laboratory work yielded an OR of 3.21 (95% CI, 1.16-8.85). Ipsilateral use of cellular telephones increased the risk for tumors in the temporal, temporoparietal, and occipital lobes (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.97-6.05), ie, the anatomic areas with highest exposure to microwaves from a mobile telephone. The result was further strengthened (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.02-6.71) in a multivariate analysis that included laboratory work and medical diagnostic x-ray investigations of the head and neck., CONCLUSION: Exposure to ionizing radiation, work in laboratories, and work in the chemical industry increased the risk of brain tumors. Use of a cellular telephone was associated with an increased risk in the anatomic area with highest exposure.",Included
3,"New radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC-SC) for chemo-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis Purpose/Objective: Linear accelerator-based radiotherapy has little effect on most of locally-advanced neoplasmas that have grown to several centimeters or more. Such tumors contain numerous hypoxic cancer cells and/or large amounts of anti-oxidative enzymes, and are therefore resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays and electrons from linear accelerators (Linac). We have developed a new radiosensitizer containing hydrogen peroxide & sodium hyaluronate for topical tumor injection for various types of tumors which are not superficially exposed, and the method was named 'KORTUC II'. Safety and effectiveness of the method have already been successfully performed by our clinical trials for patients with unresectable and/or recurrent neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of KORTUC II specifically for patients with chemotherapy-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis, and the method was named as KORTUC-SC (KORTUC for supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis). For these lesions, curative resection is impossible because of the direct invasion of neoplasms to surrounding cervical great vessels. Therefore new strategies for better local control have been needed. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was performed at Kochi Medical School Hospital between September 2006 and March 2010. Twelve patients (2 men,10 women) with chemotherapy-resistant supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were enrolled into the study after providing fully informed written consent. All the patients underwent PET-CT examinations prior to and at 3 ~ 6 months after KORTUC-SC. We compared these two examination results. Patients were 58 to 77 years old (average age was 65).The radiotherapy regimen was 4 Gy/time, 3 times/week, for 4 weeks, and total dose was 48 Gy. The appropriate energy level of electron beams was selected for individual patients in terms of depth of the target lesion. The injection of 3 to 6 ml of the agent was started from the 5th session of radiotherapy, and was performed twice a week under ultrasonographic guidance. Result(s): The numbers of the patients were 12. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by the FDG-PET performed prior to and following the KORTUC-SC treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) showed complete response (CR), 1 (8.3%) showed partial response (PR), 3 (25%) showed stable disease(SD), and another 2 (16.6%) showed progressive disease (PD). Overall survival rate was 83% at 1 year (10/12 patients) and 75% at 2 years (9/12 patients). The mean duration of follow-up at the end of February 2011 was 35.1 months. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of FDG-PET study, remarkable therapeutic effects of the KORTUC II treatment for chemotherapyresistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis (KORTUC-SC) were clearly identified. The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local pain at the injection site. The treatment outcomes were satisfactory and the adverse events were within the permissible range. This therapy is much less expensive than molecular-targeted therapies in current use, such as Cetuximab. Some well designed prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of KORTUC-SC.",Excluded
1308,"Treatment approach and survival from glioblastoma: Results from a population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway Objectives To evaluate treatment and survival from glioblastoma in a real-world setting. Design and settings A population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway. Participants 363 patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with glioblastoma between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures Overall survival and survival rates determined by Kaplan-Meier method, groups compared by log-rank test. Associations between clinical characteristics and treatment approach assessed by logistic regression. Associations between treatment approach and outcome analysed by Cox regression. Results Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.1 to 11.3). Resection was performed in 221 patients (60.9%), and was inversely associated with age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden, deep-seated tumour localisation and multifocality. Median survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 12.1 to 15.4) in patients undergoing tumour resection, 8.3 months (95% CI 6.6 to 9.9) in patients undergoing biopsy and 4.5 months (95% CI 4.0 to 5.1) in patients where no surgical intervention was performed. Chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol was given to 157 patients (43%). Age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden and cognitive impairment were associated with less intensive chemoradiotherapy. Median survival was 16.3 months (95% CI 14.1 to 18.5), 7.9 months (95% CI 6.7 to 9.0) and 2.0 months (95% CI 0.9 to 3.2) in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol, with less intensive chemoradiotherapy and with best supportive care, respectively. Surgical resection (HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.79)) and chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol (HR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15)) were strongly associated with favourable overall survival, when adjusted for clinical variables. Conclusions In a real-world setting, less than half of the patients received full-course chemoradiotherapy, with a median survival comparable to results from clinical trials. Survival was considerably worse in patients receiving less intensive treatment. Our results point out a substantial risk of undertreating glioblastoma, especially in elderly patients.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

However similarly irradiated rats receiving Y. enterocolitica 5 to 10 days later showed a substantial mortality. It is concluded that the radiosensitive mechanism for protection against Y. enterocolitica is not humoral nor cellular immunity as mediated by T and B lymphocytes or macrophages.",Included
12,"Induction therapy of loco-regional non-small-cell lung cancer with reliable response and low toxicity (low dose radiotherapy sensitizes tumor to subsequent chemotherapy?) INTRODUCTION: For the induction therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer, we need to look for a regimen which produces a reliable high response rate with a low treatment related morbidity and mortality., METHODS: Patients in clinical stages IB, IIA and B, IIIA and B received a course of therapy with 20Gy of radiation in 2 weeks. This was followed by two courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 180mg/m(2), cisplatin 45mg/m(2), and ifosfamide 1000mg/m(2). Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated and, if suitable, underwent surgical therapy., RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were entered into the study. The overall response rate was 82.86% (95% confidence interval, 66.35-94.5%). Complete response (CR) was 20% (95% confidence interval, 8.44-36.94%). Twenty-five patients had surgical resection. Subsequently 18 patients received completion radiotherapy of additional 45Gy. The median follow up is 30 months. In 12 patients with stages IB, IIA and B, the median survival was 61 months, and 5-year survival was 55%. In 23 patients with stages IIIA and B, the median survival was 26 months, and 5-year survival was 9.5%. There was 1 patient with Grade 4 and 13 patients with Grade 3 leukopenia, and half of them received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. By the completion radiotherapy, 6 out of 18 patients had less than Grade 2 esophagitis. Five patients had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and one Grade 5 (one mortality). There was no postoperative death. The survival results were comparable to those reported recently by others, however the regimen produced a high response rate with low treatment related morbidity/mortality., CONCLUSION: It is a suitable regimen for induction therapy to include earlier stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancers.",Excluded
1806,"Effect of intraoperative three-dimensional imaging during the reduction and fixation of displaced calcaneal fractures on articular congruence and implant fixation Background: Operative treatment of displaced calcaneal fractures should restore joint congruence, but conventional fluoroscopy is unable to fully visualize the subtalar joint. We questioned whether intraoperative 3-dimensional (3D) imaging would aid in the reduction of calcaneal fractures, resulting in improved articular congruence and implant positioning. Method(s): Sixty-two displaced calcaneal fractures were operated on using standard fluoroscopic views. When the surgeon had achieved a satisfactory reduction, an intraoperative 3D scan was conducted, malreductions or implant imperfections were revised, the calcaneus was rescanned, and this sequence was repeated until the optimal operative result was achieved. Result(s): Five fractures underwent 1 intraoperative scan, 39 fractures underwent 2 scans, 13 fractures underwent 3 scans, and 5 fractures underwent 4 scans. The average number of scans was 2.3. Intraoperative scanning led to re-reduction and improvement of reduction in 13 fractures, change of plate position in 1 patient, optimizing of the screw directions in 5 fractures, and shortening of screws that were intra-articular or protruding medially in 6 fractures. The postoperative articular displacement was 0 mm in 69% of the Sanders type 2 fractures and 57% of the Sanders type 3 fractures. Operation duration averaged 118 minutes, and there were no reoperations due to misplaced screws or plates. The average absorbed radiation dose per patient was 288 mGy*cm. Conclusion(s): Intraoperative 3D imaging improved the articular reduction of the posterior facet and secured optimal implant position in displaced calcaneal fractures. Radiation dose to the patient was less than that of a normal foot computed tomography scan. Level of Evidence: Level IV, case series.Copyright © 2015 The Author(s).",Excluded
126,"Medical monitoring: A beneficial remedy for residents living near an environmental hazard site Objective: People living close to an environmental hazard site may suffer health harms from real or perceived contaminant exposures. In class-action litigation, medical monitoring is a potential remedy that has been allowed in some jurisdictions but not others. From 1952 to 1989, a US Department of Energy uranium metal plant near Fernald, Ohio, released ionizing radiation and uranium particulates into the surrounding community. Method(s): Settlement of litigation between nearby residents and the Department of Energy resulted in an 18-year medical monitoring program (N = 9775), which focused on general health promotion rather than effects of uranium. Result(s): Participation was higher than projected; decreases in common risk factors (cholesterol and blood pressure) and deaths from cancer have been observed.

459,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded
1566,"Optimal management in optic nerve sheath meningioma - A multicentre study and pooled data analysis Optic nerve sheath meningiomas (ONSMs) are rare, benign neoplasms of the anterior visual pathway. The optimal modality of radiotherapy for treatment has not yet been established. This is the first study to show significant difference in visual outcomes between radiotherapy subtypes in the management of ONSM. We performed a retrospective analysis of visual outcomes and side effects in ONSM patients treated with radiotherapy at three centres in Sydney, Australia, between 2000 and 2016. 15 patients with ONSM were included, and visual outcomes (visual acuity, visual fields, colour vision, OCT retinal nerve fibre layer thickness and radiological tumour response) and treatment toxicities were assessed. Pooled data analysis of available studies was also performed. Statistical analysis was performed with binomial, two-tailed chi-squared tests and Fisher exact tests. In our cohort a significant majority experienced improved visual field (p = 0.046), stable or improved visual acuity (p = 0.0017) and colour vision (p = 0.015) after fractionated radiotherapy. Pooled analysis with strict inclusion criteria found 3D conformal radiotherapy to offer significantly poorer visual acuity compared to fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (p = 0.008). When all published studies were included, stereotactic radiosurgery was superior to 3D conformal methods (p = 0.035), and equivalent to other fractionated methods. 3D conformal methods also had significantly higher rates of long-term side effects. These results support the use of fractionated radiotherapy and radiosurgery for ONSM treatment, however 3D conformal methods cannot be recommended.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2022,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included

2295,"Dose reduction and image quality in MDCT colonography using tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to evaluate the dose reduction potential of combined online (x- and y-axes) and topogram-based (l) X-ray tube current modulation in CT colonography in a screening population., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty asymptomatic individuals underwent CT colonography screening for colon polyps. A 16-MDCT scanner (Somatom Sensation 16) was used. Forty patients were examined at 120 kVp and 120 effective mAs (supine) and 40 effective mAs (prone) using online x- and y-axis tube current modulation. Another 40 patients were scanned using combined x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation. Individual patient radiation exposure was determined using the dose-length product. Image noise was determined by Hounsfield unit measurements in the colonic lumen at four anatomic levels. Image quality was rated on a 5-point confidence scale by two independent reviewers. The unpaired Student's t test (for radiation dose, image noise) and Wilcoxon's test (for image quality) were used to test for statistically significant differences between these values., RESULTS: Radiation dose was significantly lower in the patient group scanned with x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation than in the group scanned with x- and y-axis tube current modulation (supine: 4.24 vs 6.50 mSv, p < 0.0001; prone: 1.61 vs 2.38 mSv, p < 0.0001). Radiation dose was reduced by 35% (supine) and 33% (prone). No statistically significant difference was seen in overall image noise (supine: 15.9 vs 16.3 H, p = 0.13; prone: 23.5 vs 24.8 H, p = 0.44) or image quality (supine: 4.6 vs 4.5, p = 0.62; prone: 3.5 vs 3.6, p = 0.54)., CONCLUSION: Combined x-, y-, and z-axis tube current modulation leads to a significant reduction of radiation exposure in CT colonography without loss of image quality.",Excluded
966,"IMRT in hypopharyngeal tumors BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) data on hypopharyngeal cancer (HC) are scant. In this study, the authors report on early results in an own HC patient cohort treated with IMRT. A more favorable outcome as compared to historical data on conventional radiation techniques was expected., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 consecutive HC patients were treated with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) IMRT between 01/2002 and 07/2005 (mean follow-up 16 months, range 4-44 months). Doses of 60-71 Gy with 2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction were applied. 26/29 patients were definitively irradiated, 86% received simultaneous cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 60% presented with locally advanced disease (T3/4 Nx, Tx N2c/3). Mean primary tumor volume measured 36.2 cm(3) (4-170 cm(3)), mean nodal volume 16.6 cm(3) (0-97 cm(3))., RESULTS: 2-year actuarial local, nodal, distant control, and overall disease-free survival were 90%, 93%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. In 2/4 patients with persistent disease (nodal in one, primary in three), salvage surgery was performed. The mean dose to the spinal cord (extension of > 5-15 mm) was 26 Gy (12-38 Gy); the mean maximum (point) dose was 44.4 Gy (26-58.9 Gy). One grade (G) 3 dysphagia and two G4 reactions (laryngeal fibrosis, dysphagia), both following the schedule with 2.2 Gy per fraction, have been observed so far. Larynx preservation was achieved in 25/26 of the definitively irradiated patients (one underwent a salvage laryngectomy); 23 had no or minimal dysphagia (G0-1)., CONCLUSION: Excellent early disease control and high patient satisfaction with swallowing function in HC following SIB IMRT were observed; these results need to be confirmed based on a longer follow-up period. In order to avoid G4 reactions, SIB doses of < 2.2 Gy/fraction are recommended for large tumors involving laryngeal structures.",Excluded
1827,"Time trend of patient setup deviations during pelvic irradiation using electronic portal imaging An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was used to detect patient setup displacement during the course of a 3-field pelvic irradiation of two groups of patients: 10 rectal and 10 prostate carcinomas. These patients were irradiated with conventional treatment techniques in routine clinical practice. A total of 469 portal images and 60 simulator films were used to determine the values of setup deviations in the X- Y- and Z-directions of a fixed coordinate system, corresponding to the medio-lateral, cranio-caudal and antero-posterior direction, respectively. The absolute displacement averaged over all setups and patients ranged between 0.4 mm and 1.4 mm with a standard deviation (S.D.) of 1.6-3.9 mm. The overall distribution along each direction could be separated into a distribution of random deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.2 to 2.8 mm) around the mean deviation of each patient and a distribution of the means themselves: the distribution of systematic deviations (S.D.s ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 mm). Significant gradual displacement as a function of time was detected in 5 out of the 20 patients, 2 in the rectum and 3 in the prostate group. This ""time trend"" was found along each of the 3 directions specified. The magnitude of the time-dependent displacement throughout the course of treatment ranged between 4 and 11 mm. It can be concluded that for treatments requiring a high level of precision, portal images should be made and analyzed during the whole treatment course in order to detect and correct significant time trends.",Excluded
2523,"Detection of unwarranted CT radiation exposure from patient and imaging protocol meta-data using regularized regression Background: Variability in radiation exposure from CT scans can be appropriate and driven by patient features such as body habitus. Quantitative analysis may be performed to discover instances of unwarranted radiation exposure and to reduce the probability of such occurrences in future patient visits. No universal process to perform identification of outliers is widely available, and access to expertise and resources is variable. Objective(s): The goal of this study is to develop an automated outlier detection procedure to identify all scans with an unanticipated high radiation exposure, given the characteristics of the patient and the type of the exam. Material(s) and Method(s): This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective cohort study was conducted from June 30, 2012 - December 31, 2013 in a quaternary academic medical center. The de-identified dataset contained 28 fields for 189,959 CT exams. We applied the variable selection method Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select important variables for predicting CT radiation dose. We then employed a regression approach that is robust to outliers, to learn from data a predictive model of CT radiation doses given important variables identified by LASSO. Patient visits whose predicted radiation dose was statistically different from the radiation dose actually received were identified as outliers. Result(s): Our methodology identified 1% of CT exams as outliers. The top-5 predictors discovered by LASSO and strongly correlated with radiation dose were Tube Current, kVp, Weight, Width of collimator, and Reference milliampere-seconds. A human expert validation of the outlier detection algorithm has yielded specificity of 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92]and sensitivity of 0.91 [95% CI 0.85-0.97](PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.92). These values substantially outperform alternative methods we tested (F1 score 0.88 for our method against 0.51 for the alternatives). Conclusion(s): The study developed and tested a novel, automated method for processing CT scanner meta-data to identify CT exams where patients received an unwarranted amount of radiation. Radiation safety and protocol review committees may use this technique to uncover systemic issues and reduce future incidents.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded
237,"Disaster preparedness education and a Midwest Regional Poison Center OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge and comfort related to disaster preparedness and response gained and retained from a disaster medicine workshop given to Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI). DESIGN: A pilot study with a pre-post intervention design. SETTING: A Midwest Regional Poison Center. PARTICIPANTS: All CSPIs employed at the participating Poison Center (N = 27) were recruited. Participation ranged from 44 percent (n = 12) for the 4-month postworkshop knowledge quiz to 78 percent (n = 21) for the preworkshop survey. INTERVENTION: A disaster medicine workshop was given to the CSPIs. Quizzes and surveys were done preworkshop and then repeated at 1 week, 4 months, and 14 months postworkshop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSPI knowledge and comfort pertaining to disaster-related calls. RESULT(S): CSPIs' comfort levels with calls regarding major chemical or nuclear/radiation disasters significantly increased and stayed elevated during all follow-up periods [Kruskal-Wallis chi2 (3) = 13.1, p = 0.01]. The average preworkshop quiz score was 58.2 percent. A statistically significant increase in mean quiz score was demonstrated amongst preworkshop and postworkshop scores at all tested time intervals (F = 18.8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): CSPIs' knowledge regarding disaster management significantly increased after a disaster medicine workshop, and this knowledge was significantly retained for the 14-month duration of this study. Currently, there are no uniform guidelines for Poison Centers regarding disaster response training. Studies targeted at the development of educational competencies for CSPIs and disaster response would help to standardize this much needed education.",Excluded
930,"Quantification of coronary artery calcium on the basis of dual-energy coronary CT angiography PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using virtual noncontrast material-enhanced (VNC) computed tomographic (CT) series derived from dual-energy CT imaging studies for coronary artery calcium quantification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved; all patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

2955,"Significant correlations between human cortical bone mineral density and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) obtained with 3D Cones ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI) PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI is a tool that can characterize changes in susceptibility, an intrinsic property which is associated with compositional changes in the tissue. Current QSM estimation of cortical bone is challenging because conventional clinical MRI cannot acquire signal in cortical bone. This study aimed to implement Cones 3D ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) for ex vivo QSM measurements in human tibial cortical bone, investigating the correlations of QSM with volumetric intracortical bone mineral density (BMD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine tibial midshaft cortical bone specimens (25mm long specimens cut at the mid-point of tibial shaft, 67+/-20years old, 5 women and 4 men) were scanned on a clinical 3T MRI scanner for QSM measurement. The specimens were also scanned on a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner for volumetric BMD estimation. QSM and muCT results were compared at approximately nine regions of interest (ROIs) per specimen., RESULTS: Average 3D UTE-MRI QSM showed significantly strong correlation with volumetric BMD (R=-0.82, P<0.01) and bone porosity (R=0.72, P<0.01). Combining all data points together (77 ROIs), QSM showed significant moderate to strong correlation with volumetric BMD after correction for interdependencies in specimens (R=-0.70, P<0.01). The corrections were required because the data points were not independent in each specimen. Similarly, the correlation between QSM and porosity was significant (R=0.68, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Cones 3D UTE-MRI QSM technique can potentially serve as a novel and accurate tool to assess intracortical bone mineral density whilst avoiding ionizing radiation.

2097,"Nucleoid sedimentation analysis of DNA superstructure, gamma-radiation-induced damage and repair in human and chacma baboon (Papia ursinus) peripheral lymphocytes The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes. The effects of sedimentation conditions and advantages of using vertical-tube rotors in the nucleoid sedimentation technique are also discussed.",Included
501,"Organ biodistribution of Germanium-68 in rat in the presence and absence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC for the extrapolation to the human organ and whole-body radiation dosimetry Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in particular gallium-68 (68Ga) applications are growing exponentially worldwide contributing to the expansion of nuclear medicine and personalized management of patients. The significance of 68Ga utility is reflected in the implementation of European Pharmacopoeia monographs. However, there is one crucial point in the monographs that might limit the use of the generators and consequently expansion of 68Ga applications and that is the limit of 0.001% of Germanium-68 (68Ge(IV)) radioactivity content in a radiophar-maceutical. We have investigated the organ distribution of 68Ge(IV) in rat and estimated human dosimetry parameters in order to provide experimental evidence for the determination and justification of the 68Ge(IV) limit. Male and female rats were injected in the tail vein with formulated [68Ge]GeCl4 in the absence or presence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. The tissue radioactivity distribution data was extrapolated for the estimation of human organ equivalent doses and total effective dose using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM). 68Ge(IV) was evenly distributed among the rat organs and fast renal excretion prevailed. Human organ equivalent dose and total effective dose estimates indicated that the kidneys were the dose-limiting organs (185+/-54 muSv/MBq for female and 171+/-38 muSv/MBq for male) and the total effective dose was 15.5+/-0.1 and 10.7+/-1.2 muSv/MBq, respectively for female and male. The results of this dosimetry study conclude that the 68Ge(IV) limit currently recommended by monographs could be increased considerably (>100 times) without exposing the patient to harm given the small absorbed doses to normal organs and fast excretion.",Excluded
1456,"Correlation between radiation dose and p53 protein expression levels in human lymphocytes The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included
1575,"Optimization of stereotactic radiotherapy treatment delivery technique for base-of-skull meningiomas This study compares static conformal field (CF), intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and dynamic arcs (DA) for the stereotactic radiotherapy of base-of-skull meningiomas. Twenty-one cases of base-of-skull meningioma (median planning target volume [PTV] = 21.3 cm3) previously treated with stereotactic radiotherapy were replanned with each technique. The plans were compared for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI), and doses to normal structures at 6 dose values from 50.4 Gy to 5.6 Gy. The mean CI was 1.75 (CF), 1.75 (DA), and 1.66 (IMRT) (p < 0.05 when comparing IMRT to either CF or DA plans). The CI (IMRT) was inversely proportional to the size of the PTV (Spearman's rho = -0.53, p = 0.01) and at PTV sizes above 25 cm3, the CI (IMRT) was always superior to CI (DA) and CI (CF). At PTV sizes below 25 cm3, there was no significant difference in CI between each technique. There was no significant difference in HI between plans. The total volume of normal tissue receiving 50.4, 44.8, and 5.6 Gy was significantly lower when comparing IMRT to CF and DA plans (p < 0.05). There was significantly improved dose sparing for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe with IMRT but no significant difference for the optic chiasm or pituitary gland. These results demonstrate that stereotactic IMRT should be considered to treat base-of-skull meningiomas with a PTV larger than 25 cm3, due to improved conformity and normal tissue sparing, in particular for the brain stem and ipsilateral temporal lobe.",Excluded

1710,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded
690,"Comparison of Machine Learning Optimal Classification Trees With the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma Decision Rules Importance: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the standard for the rapid diagnosis of intracranial injury, but it is costly and exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules for identifying children with minor head trauma who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) are widely used to triage CT imaging. Objective: To examine whether optimal classification trees (OCTs), which are novel machine-learning classifiers, improve on PECARN rules' predictive accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of prospective, publicly available data on emergency department visits for head trauma used by the PECARN group to develop their tool was conducted to derive OCT-based prediction rules for ciTBI in a development cohort and compare their predictive performance vs the PECARN rules in a validation cohort among children who were younger than 2 years and 2 years or older. Data on 42412 children with head trauma and without severely altered mental status who were examined between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, were gathered from 25 emergency departments in North America participating in PECARN. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2016, to December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was ciTBI, with predictive performance measured by estimating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the OCT and the PECARN rules. The OCT and PECARN rules' performance was compared by estimating ratios for each measure. Results: Of the 42412 children (15 996 [37.7%] girls) included in the analysis, 10718 were younger than 2 years (25.3%; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [0.6] months) and 31694 were 2 years or older (74.7%; age, 9.1 [4.9] years). Compared with PECARN rules, OCTs misclassified 0 vs 1 child with ciTBI in the younger and 10 vs 9 children with ciTBI in the older cohort, and correctly identified more children with very low risk of ciTBI in the younger (7605 vs 5701) and older (20 594 vs 18 134) cohorts. In the validation cohorts, compared with the PECARN rules, the OCTs had statistically significantly better specificity (in the younger cohort: 69.3%; 95% CI, 67.4%-71.2% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 50.8%-54.9%; in the older cohort: 65.6%; 95% CI, 64.5%-66.8% vs 57.6%; 95% CI, 56.4%-58.8%), positive predictive value (odds ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively), and positive likelihood ratio (risk ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio between the 2 sets of rules. Conclusions and Relevance: If implemented, OCTs may help reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans, without missing more patients with ciTBI than the PECARN rules.",Excluded

Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone. These findings indicate that the SMF studied here under different conditions elevated seizure threshold and had anticonvulsant properties in Black Swiss mice and increased the efficacy of a conventional anticonvulsant drug.",Excluded
204,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT.

897,"Machine learning applied on chest x-ray can aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19: a first experience from Lombardy, Italy BACKGROUND: We aimed to train and test a deep learning classifier to support the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using chest x-ray (CXR) on a cohort of subjects from two hospitals in Lombardy, Italy., METHODS: We used for training and validation an ensemble of ten convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mainly bedside CXRs of 250 COVID-19 and 250 non-COVID-19 subjects from two hospitals (Centres 1 and 2). We then tested such system on bedside CXRs of an independent group of 110 patients (74 COVID-19, 36 non-COVID-19) from one of the two hospitals. A retrospective reading was performed by two radiologists in the absence of any clinical information, with the aim to differentiate COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction served as the reference standard., RESULTS: At 10-fold cross-validation, our deep learning model classified COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients with 0.78 sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.81), 0.82 specificity (95% CI 0.78-0.85), and 0.89 area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI 0.86-0.91). For the independent dataset, deep learning showed 0.80 sensitivity (95% CI 0.72-0.86) (59/74), 0.81 specificity (29/36) (95% CI 0.73-0.87), and 0.81 AUC (95% CI 0.73-0.87). Radiologists' reading obtained 0.63 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.78 specificity (95% CI 0.61-0.90) in Centre 1 and 0.64 sensitivity (95% CI 0.52-0.74) and 0.86 specificity (95% CI 0.71-0.95) in Centre 2., CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary experience based on ten CNNs trained on a limited training dataset shows an interesting potential of deep learning for COVID-19 diagnosis. Such tool is in training with new CXRs to further increase its performance.",Excluded
24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm. So, all patients with head and neck malignancy should undergo an oral examination before the initiation of cancer therapy with adequate prophylaxis.",Excluded
1986,"Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer causes prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency PURPOSE: A worsened anorectal function after chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer is often attributed to radiation damage of the anorectum and pelvic floor. Its impact on pudendal nerve function is unclear. This prospective study evaluated the short-term effect of preoperative combined chemoradiation on anorectal physiologic and pudendal nerve function. METHOD(S): Sixty-six patients (39 men, 27 women) with localized resectable (T3, T4, or N1) rectal cancer were included in the study. All patients received 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m2/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/day) concurrently on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin within 6 cm of the anal verge had the anus included in the field of radiotherapy (Group A, n = 26). Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin 6 to 12 cm from the anal verge had shielding of the anus during radiotherapy (Group B, n = 40). The Wexner continence score, anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency were assessed at baseline and four weeks after completion of chemoradiation. RESULT(S): The median Wexner score deteriorated significantly (P < 0.0001) from 0 to 2.5 for both Groups A (range, 0-8) and B (range, 0-14). The maximum resting anal pressures were unchanged after chemoradiation. The maximum squeeze anal pressures were reduced (mean = 166.5-157.5 mmHg) after chemoradiation. This change was similar in both Groups A and B. Eighteen patients (Group A = 7, Group B = 11) developed prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency after chemoradiation. These 18 patients similarly had a worsened median Wexner continence score (range, 0-3) and maximum squeeze anal pressures (mean = 165.5-144 mmHg). The results obtained were independent of tumor response to chemoradiation. CONCLUSION(S): Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer carries a significant risk of pudendal neuropathy, which might contribute to the incidence of fecal incontinence after restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer. © The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons 2005.",Excluded
27,"Can both cruciate ligaments be preserved in knee arthroplasty? Eight- to nine-year follow-up of a bicompartmental knee replacement Preservation of native knee anatomy may confer improved patient satisfaction, as suggested by patient satisfaction scores in unicondylar versus total knee replacement. Bicompartmental knee replacement (BKR) implants similarly promote native tissue preservation. We retrospectively reviewed 42 consecutive patients who underwent BKR from 2006 to 2007. Outcome measures were evaluated. At an average follow-up of 103 months (range 87-110), 34/42 (81%) of implants survived. Among the retained implants, the Knee Society Score (KSS) grade was excellent in 26/34 (76.5%), good in 5/34 (14.7%), fair in 3/34 (8.8%), and poor in 0/34 (0%) of cases. Midterm results of BKR demonstrated 81% survival and 76% with excellent KSS grading. Despite a 20% revision rate at the short-term follow-up, the retained implants functioned well at the midterm follow-up.Copyright © 2016 by Begell House, Inc.",Excluded
184,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200. Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Included

Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores before operation, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage volume, blood transfusion rates, postoperative bedridden time, postoperative hospital stays, intraoperative fluoroscopic time, levels of serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) before operation, 3 days and 1 week after operation, VAS scores before operation, 3 days and 1 week after operation, and ODI and VAS scores in the last follow-up between the two groups were compared., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the two groups in the operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative drainage, blood transfusion rates, postoperative bedridden time, postoperative hospital stays and intraoperative fluoroscopic time; all indicators in MOTLIF group were superior to those in COTLIF group (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups in levels of serum CPK before operation and 1 week after operation (p>0.05). However, 3 days after operation, the level of serum CPK in COTLIF group was increased more significantly than that in MOTLIF group (647.4+/-178.6 vs. 467.4+/-189.4). There were no differences between the two groups in ODI and VAS scores before operation; ODI score in MOTLIF group in the last follow-up was significantly superior to that in COTLIF group (p>0.05). And VAS scores at 3 days and 1 week after operation and the last follow-up in MOTLIF group were superior to those in COTLIF group (p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the conventional open TLIF, mini-open TLIF via Wiltse's approach using the self-designed operating apparatus is characterized by the convenient operation, small trauma and quick recovery after operation. At the same time, the radiation exposure is lower and long-term follow-up effect is superior. Its short-term and long-term effects in the treatment of lower lumbar degenerative disease are also superior.",Excluded
3366,"Impact of radiation dose to neural stem cell niche on outcomes in malignant gliomas 4 Background: Malignant gliomas represent most aggressive form of brain tumours. They are characterised by poor prognosis and universal recurrences. Recent studies indicate that malignant gliomas contain cancer stem cells which are capable of self-renewal and tumour propagation. The origin Gliomas Cancer stem cells is believed to be from normal neuronal stem cells (NSC) located in subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult human brain. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between radiation dose to the subventricular zone and survival in malignant glioma patients. Method(s): 40 adult patients diagnosed as Grade III or Grade IV Glioma at Yashoda Hospitals between January of 2014 and July of 2014 were included in this study. Using radiation planning software and patient radiological records, the subventricular zone was reconstructed for each of these patients and dosimetry data for these structures was calculated. Log Rank Test and Multivariate analysis were used to find the impact of High Subventricular Zone dose on survival. Result(s): The mean of age of the sample population is 49.68 years (range, 20-78 years). ECOG Status for the all the patients enrolled in the study is 1. Out of 40 patients enrolled into the trial 31 are of Grade 4 Tumors (Glioblastoma) and 9 were Grade 3 tumours. Median doses of the means of Ipsilateral subventricular zone, Contralateral subventricular zone and Total subventricular zone are 50.89, 34.66 and 41.04 respectively. Median overall survival of the sample population is 21 months. One year survival of the sample population is 85%; 2 year survival is 35%. Univariate analysis has not shown any significant impact higher median dose in malignant gliomas. However when Univariate analysis was done in Grade IV gliomas there is significant impact of higher median dose to Ipsilateral Subventricular zone (P value 0.01) and Total Subventricular zone on Overall survival (P value 0.04). Conclusion(s): This study leads us to hypothesize that in glioma targeted radiotherapy of the stem cell niches in the adult brain could yield significant benefits over radiotherapy of the primary tumor mass alone. Prospective randomised interventional study is needed to validate subventricular zone irradiation as standard of practice.",Excluded
3234,"Salivary anionic changes after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A 1-year prospective study Objectives: To investigate the salivary anionic changes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

1464,"Salivary gland-sparing other than parotid-sparing in definitive head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiotherapy does not seem to jeopardize local control Background: The objective was to analyze locoregional (LR) failure patterns in patients with head-and-neck cancer (HNC) treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with whole salivary gland-sparing: parotid (PG), submandibular (SMG), and accessory salivary glands represented by the oral cavity (OC). Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with Stage I-II (23%) or III/IV (77%) HNC treated by definitive IMRT were included. For all LR failure patients, the FDG-PET and CT scans documenting recurrence were rigidly registered to the initial treatment planning CT. Failure volumes (Vf) were delineated based on clinical, radiological, and histological data. The percentage of Vf covered by 95% of the prescription isodose (Vf-V95) was analyzed. Failures were classified as "" in-field"" if Vf-V95 >= 95%, "" marginal"" if 20% < Vf-V95 < 95%, and "" out-of-field"" if Vf-V95 <=20%. Correlation between Vf-V95 and mean doses (Dmean) in the PG, SMG, and OC was assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation test. The salivary gland dose impact on the LR recurrence risk was assessed by Cox analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up was 20 months (6-35). Contralateral and ipsilateral PGs were spared in 98% and 54% of patients, respectively, and contralateral and ipsilateral SMG in 26% and 7%, respectively. The OC was spared to a dose <=40 Gy in 26 patients (37%). The 2-year LR control rate was 76.5%. One recurrence was "" marginal"" , and 12 were "" in-field"" No recurrence was observed in vicinity of spared structures. Vf-V95 was not significantly correlated with Dmean in PG, SMG, and OC. The LR recurrence risk was not increased by lower Dmean in the salivary glands, but by T (p = 0.04) and N stages (p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): Over 92% of LR failures occurred "" in-field"" within the high dose region when using IMRT with a whole salivary gland-sparing strategy. Sparing SMG and OC in addition to PG thus appears a safe strategy. © 2013 Chajon et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1584,"Simulated stand tests on earth, moon and mars and centrifuge parameters to prevent cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight Postflight Orthostatic Intolerance (POI) results from cardiovascular adaptation to spaceflight and affects a significant fraction of astronauts returning to earth after missions that are merely a couple of weeks in duration and may be even more prevalent after longer missions, such as those to the moon and Mars. To prevent cardiovascular deconditioning a centrifuge may be utilized to induce gravity-like stresses within the body. The current investigation allows insight into the mechanisms of POI by simulating stand tests on Earth, the moon, and Mars while predicting centrifuge spin rates that sufficiently mimic each constant gravity reference. It was found that the modeled nonfinishing male & female astronaut would become presyncopal in about 4&7min, 32&56min, 104&182min while losing 160&280mL, 512&896mL, 692&1211mL of blood volume (BV) at the onset of presyncope in each case for Earth, Mars, and the moon, respectively. The modeled finishing male astronaut endured the length of the stand test in every case, but lost only 100mL, 320, and 432mL BV by the end of each stand test. Centrifuge speeds for equivalent times to presyncope for female and finishing & nonfinishing male astronauts loaded the body with G loads at heart level for Earth, Mars, and the moon cases consistently less than the constant gravity reference level for both the NASA short & long arm centrifuges.Keywords-Spaceflight, Syncope, Stand test, Centrifuge.",Excluded
2270,"[Non-Parametric Analysis of Radiation Risks of Mortality among Chernobyl Clean-Up Workers] Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02). Risks coefficient (slope coefficient of excess mortality at a dose of 1 Gy) for solid cancers was 1.94 (95% CI: - 3.10, 7.00) x 10(-2) and for circulation diseases it was 0.67 (95% CI: -9.61, 11.00) x 10(-2). 137 deaths from radiation-induced cancers and 47 deaths from circulation diseases were registered during a follow up period.",Included
1023,"Value of dual-phase 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy with neck and thoracic SPECT/CT in secondary hyperparathyroidism OBJECTIVE. Surgical intervention in the form of parathyroidectomy is generally considered only for severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). However, correct location of the parathyroid glands before parathyroidectomy is a challenge. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT in the detection of parathyroid tissue to guide operative treatment of patients with sHPT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eighty patients with sHPT who were undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated preoperatively with dual-phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT parathyroid scintigraphy to locate parathyroid tissue before parathyroidectomy. The scintigraphic results were classified as positive or negative. The accuracy of 99mTc sestamibi early and delayed phase SPECT/CT scintigraphy was determined. RESULTS. Early phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT depicted 3.57 parathyroid glands (PTGs) and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT depicted 3.55 PTGs per study. The specificity of both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT in detecting PTGs was 100%. The 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT images of 7 of 80 patients showed positive findings in the delayed phase and negative findings in the early phase. The 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT images of 6 of 80 patients showed positive findings in the early phase and negative findings in the delayed phase. CONCLUSION. The results of our study indicate that both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT should be performed in the preoperative evaluation of hemodialysis patients with sHPT due to chronic kidney disease. Performance of both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT did not increase the radiation dose compared with the use of only the early or the delayed phase. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

1692,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals. Conclusion(s): Ovariectomized female macaques exposed to moderate doses of radiation experienced increased morbidity, including acute, dose-dependent alterations in systemic and tissue-specific biomarkers, and increased macrophage/T cell ratios. The effects on mortality exceeded expectations based on previous studies in males, warranting further investigation.Copyright © 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Excluded

3324,"The degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs negatively influence union rate of osteoporotic vertebral fracture: A multicenter cohort study Background: With the increasing aging population in developed countries, there has been an associated increased prevalence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). Many previous reports have attempted to predict the risk of delayed union associated with OVF. However, the role of endplate failure and the degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs, and their association with delayed union has received little attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the endplate fracture and disc degeneration rank as risk factors for delayed union. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with fresh OVF were enrolled in the study. MRI and X-ray were performed at the time of enrollment and at the 6 months follow-up. The MR images were used to assess the degeneration grade of adjacent intervertebral discs (using the modified Pfirrmann grading system), and endplate failure. Supine and weight-bearing radiographs were used to define angular motion and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral body wall. Result(s): A total of 139 patients (112 female, 27 male) completed the 6 month follow-up (a 65.1% follow-up rate). The study revealed 27 cases of delayed union (19.4%). A healthier adjacent caudal disc with low grade degeneration was found to be associated with an increased risk of delayed union (P = 0.008). Bi-endplate injury and significant compression of the anterior vertebral body wall were significantly associated with delayed union (P = 0.019, and P = 0.001 respectively). Rapid progression of the adjacent cranial disc degeneration was observed at the end of the 6 month follow-up period (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Modified Pfirrmann grading system revealed that a healthier adjacent intervertebral disc at the caudal level and bi-endplate fracture were significantly associated with an increased risk of delayed union. These findings may influence the management strategy for patients with OVF.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

294,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

2850,"A hybrid iterative reconstruction algorithm that improves the image quality of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether a hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) algorithm improves image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CTA) compared with filtered back projection (FBP)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients (seven men, 11 women; mean age, 67.8 years) underwent retrospectively gated coronary CTA at 80 kV with a volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) of 18.8 mGy on a 64-MDCT scanner. CT images were reconstructed using only FBP and only HIR. For each patient, CT images subjected to the two different reconstructions were reviewed by two observers. Quantitative image quality parameters-that is, CT attenuation (HU) of the coronary arteries, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-were calculated and compared for the two reconstruction methods and the overall image quality for each reconstruction was visually scored on a 5-point scale., RESULTS: The mean estimated effective radiation dose for 80-kV coronary CTA was 4.7 +/- 0.4 (SD) mSv. The two reconstruction methods did not significantly differ with respect to the CT attenuation of the coronary arteries. The image noise was significantly lower with HIR than with FBP (20.3 +/- 5.3 vs 49.4 +/- 12.0 HU, respectively; p < 0.01), and the CNR was significantly higher with HIR than with FBP (29.8 +/- 7.4 vs 12.7 +/- 2.9, p < 0.01). The visual scores for image quality were higher with HIR than with FBP (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The HIR algorithm can reduce image noise and improve image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CTA.",Excluded
372,"Low-dose MDCT and CT enterography of patients with crohn disease: Feasibility of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in the evaluation of Crohn disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Forty-eight patients (20 men, 28 women; mean age, 33.3 years; range, 17-83 years) with known or suspected Crohn disease who underwent low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with ASIR between December 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients had previously undergone standard-dose 64-MDCT and CT enterography with filtered back projection (FBP), and those images were used for comparison. The weight-based IV contrast protocol and scan parameters (120 kVp, 5-mm section thickness, 0.5-second rotation, pitch of 1.375, 64 x 0.625 mm detector configuration) were constant for the two techniques except for a higher noise index (x1.3) in the ASIR group. Two blinded readers reviewed 75 randomized MDCT-CT enterographic scans of 48 patients to assess image quality and diagnostic performance in the evaluation of Crohn disease, and the radiation dose for the studies was estimated. RESULTS. All 75 MDCT and CT enterographic scans had acceptable quality for diagnostic interpretation. Findings of Crohn disease were seen on 63 of 75 scans (84%). Low-dose scans in the ASIR group had optimal image quality and were rated comparable to or better than standard-dose FBP images (mean score, 4.2 vs 3.87; p = 0.007). The subjective image noise score (mean, 1.43 vs 1.58; p = 0.2) and objective image noise measurements were lower for ASIR images (p < 0.001). Low-dose studies with ASIR allowed average dose reduction of 34.5% compared with standard-dose scans with FBP (volume CT dose index for ASIR, 7.7 +/- 2.1 mGy; for FBP, 12 +/- 5.5 mGy; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT and CT enterographic studies reconstructed with ASIR were of appropriate quality for confident evaluation of the manifestations of Crohn disease while allowing approximately 34% dose reduction in comparison with FBP technique. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1773,"Retrospective assessment of self-reported exposure to medical ionizing radiation: results of a feasibility study conducted in Germany BACKGROUND: Exposure to medical ionizing radiation has been increasing over the past decades and constitutes the largest contributor to overall radiation exposure in the general population. While occupational exposures are generally monitored by national radiation protection agencies, individual data on medical radiation exposure for the general public are not regularly collected. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of assessing lifetime medical ionizing radiation exposure from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures retrospectively and prospectively within the framework of the German National Cohort study., METHODS: Retrospective assessment of individual medical radiation exposure was done using an interviewer-based questionnaire among 199 participants (87 men and 112 women) aged 20-69 randomly drawn from the general population at two recruitment locations in Germany. X-ray cards were distributed to 97 participants at one recruitment center to prospectively collect medical radiation exposure over a 6-month period. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences in self-reported median examination frequencies for the variables age, sex, and recruitment center. To evaluate the self-reported information on radiological procedures, agreement was assessed using health insurance data as gold standard for the time period 2005 to 2010 from 8 participants., RESULTS: Participants reported a median of 7 lifetime X-ray examinations (interquartile range 4-13), and 42% (n = 83) reported having had a CT scan (2, IQR = 1-3). Women reported statistically significant more X-ray examinations than men. Individual frequencies above the 75th percentile (>=15 X-ray examinations) were predominantly observed among women and in individuals >50 years of age. The prospective exposure assessment yielded a 60% return-rate of X-ray cards (n = 58). 16 (28%) of the returned cards reported radiological examinations conducted during the 6-month period but generally lacked more detailed exposure information. X-ray examinations reported for the period for which health insurance data were available provided a moderately valid measure of individual medical radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of more recent medical examinations seems in the German National Cohort study feasible, whereas lifetime medical radiation exposure appears difficult to assess via self-reports. Health insurance data may be a potentially useful tool for the assessment of individual data on medical radiation exposure both retrospectively and prospectively.",Excluded
2580,"Facilitation of somatic calcium channels can evoke prolonged tail currents in rat hypoglossal motoneurons Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha motoneurons. PICs are thought to be mediated by membrane channels located primarily on the dendrites as evidenced by prolonged tail currents following the termination of a voltage step and by a clockwise hysteresis in the whole cell inward currents recorded in response to depolarizing then repolarizing voltage ramp commands. We report here, however, that voltage-clamp currents with these same features can be generated in isolated somatic membrane patches from rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Long-lasting (200-800 ms) tail currents after 1-s voltage-clamp pulses were observed in nucleated patches from 16 of 23 cells. Further, these somatic PICs display ""facilitation"" in response to conditioning depolarization as previously observed in whole cell recordings from intact neurons. Pharmacological tests suggest that the PICs were primarily mediated by Cav1 channels. Our results show that many of the features of persistent calcium currents recorded from intact motoneurons do not necessarily reflect a remote dendritic origin but can also be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of their Cav1 channels.",Excluded
2268,"Acute Erythemal Ultraviolet Radiation Causes Systemic Immunosuppression in the Absence of Increased 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Male Mice Vitamin D is synthesised by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of skin and is hypothesized to be a direct mediator of the immunosuppression that occurs following UV radiation (UVR) exposure. Both UVR and vitamin D drive immune responses towards tolerance by ultimately increasing the suppressive activities of regulatory T cells. To examine a role for UVR-induced vitamin D, vitamin D3-deficient mice were established by dietary vitamin D3 restriction. In comparison to vitamin D3-replete mice, vitamin D3-deficient mice had significantly reduced serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3, <20 nmol.L-1) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3, <20 pmol.L-1). Following either acute erythemal UVR, or chronic sub-erythemal UVR (8 exposures over 4 weeks) treatment, serum 25(OH)D3 levels significantly increased in vitamin D3-deficient female but not male mice. To determine if UVR-induced vitamin D was a mediator of UVR-induced systemic immunosuppression, responses were measured in mice that were able (female) or unable (male) to increase systemic levels of 25(OH)D3 after UVR. Erythemal UVR (>=4 kJ/m2) suppressed contact hypersensitivity responses (T helper type-1 or -17), aspects of allergic airway disease (T helper type-2) and also the in vivo priming capacity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to a similar degree in female and male vitamin D3-deficient mice. Thus, in male mice, UVR-induced 25(OH)D3 is not essential for mediating the immunosuppressive effects of erythemal UVR. © 2012 Gorman et al.",Excluded
123,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the prognostic factors for 840 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who received radiotherapy (RT) and to provide information about improvement in NPC RT techniques. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data from 840 cases of NPC that received RT from January 1996 to December 2001 in our hospital. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the control rate of nasopharynx, the tumor-free survival rate and overall survival. Log-rank test was conducted to determine significance. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to confirm the significance of prognostic factors. Result(s): 1) The total control rates of nasopharynx for 3, 5 and 10 years were 70.6%, 56.7% and 36.6%, respectively. The tumor-free survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 66.8%, 51.8% and 32.0%, respectively. The overall survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 73.8%, 58.6% and 39.4%, respectively. 2) Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, N stage, skull base invasion, cranial nerve invasion, nasal cavity invasion, cervical node metastasis, unilateral/bilateral neck node metastasis, cervical node metastasis position, intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx, external beam radiotherapy method and chemotherapy were significantly associated with the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival, and overall survival (P<0.05). The irradiation dose of nasopharynx was significantly associated with the nasopharynx control rate and overall survival (P<0.05). The tumor-free survival of the patients with carotid sheath involvement was lower than that of the patients without carotid sheath involvement (P<0.05). 3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, unilateral/bilateral cervical node metastasis, and intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx were independent influential factors of the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival. 4) The stratified analysis showed that T2 and T3 patients who received adjuvant high dose intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx presented with a higher control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Male NPC patients with advanced clinical stage (especially T stage) and bilateral cervical node metastasis have a poorer prognosis. Adjuvant intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx can improve the prognosis of T2 and T3 patients.",Excluded
669,"Helicobacter gastritis induces changes in the oxyntic mucosa indistinguishable from the effects of proton pump inhibitors A causal relationship between oxyntic glands dilatation with protruding parietal cells, referred to as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effects, and PPI use has been suspected but not established. We designed this study to evaluate the association between these changes and the use of PPIs and histamine 2-receptor blockers (H2-blockers). We obtained five Sydney System-compliant biopsy specimens from patients recruited into a therapeutic trial for H. pylori. Medication history with details on PPI and H 2-blockers use was collected. Two blinded pathologists graded gastritis and the intensity of putative PPI effects using a 0 to 3 scale. PPI and H2-blocker use was then disclosed and the accuracy of pathologists' assessment was analyzed. There were 138 H. pylori-negative and 104 positive patients. In H. pylori-negative patients the histologic assessment for PPI use had 77.5% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 86.9% and a negative predictive value of 35.9%. In H. pylori-positive patients, sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity 26.1%. Positive and negative predictive values were 55.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Neither glandular dilatations nor parietal cell protrusions related to H2-blocker use. We conclude that these changes are associated with PPI use only in H. pylori-negative subjects. In H. pylori gastritis, so-called PPI-effects were equally prevalent in PPI-users and non-users, indicating that other factors are involved in the induction of oxyntic cell hyperplasia. We suggest that comments regarding the supposed evidence of PPI use are too often wrong to be useful and should be avoided in the diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present study was to assess the dosimetric parameters, toxicity, and treatment outcomes of patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Between 2003 and 2008, 42 patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma underwent definitive high-dose and extended involved-field IMRT with or without combination chemotherapy. The median radiation dose to the primary tumor was 50 Gy. The dose-volume histograms of the target volume and critical normal structures were evaluated in all patients. The locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The average mean dose delivered to the planning target volume was 55.5 Gy. Only 1.3% and 2.5% of the planning target volume received <90% and 95% of the prescribed dose, respectively, indicating excellent planning target volume coverage. The mean dose and average dose to the parotid glands was 15 Gy and 14 Gy, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 27 months, the 2-year locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survivalrate was 93%, 78%, and 74%, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 acute or late toxicity was reported. Conclusion(s): High-dose and extended involved-field IMRT for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma showed favorable locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival, with mild toxicity. The dose constraints of IMRT for the parotid glands can be limited to <20 Gy in these patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2154,"Low-dose CT with automatic tube current modulation, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and low tube voltage for the diagnosis of renal colic: Impact of body mass index OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to evaluate the impact of body mass index (BMI) on dose, diagnostic performance, and image quality of a low-dose CT examination for renal colic. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included all patients who underwent a low-dose CT examination for renal colic performed during the year 2012 with automatic tube current modulation, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and a low tube voltage (kV). Three readers independently reviewed all images for the presence of renal colic and evaluated diagnostic confidence and image quality. The results and doses were compared among patients grouped by body mass index (BMI) and between patients with a BMI < 25 and those with a BMI >= 25. RESULTS. Eighty-six patients were included in the study: 39 patients had a BMI < 25 and 47 had a BMI >= 25. No statistically significant difference was found between the accuracy rates for the diagnosis of renal colic when the rates of the three independent readers were averaged for both BMI groups (95.7% vs 96.4%, respectively; p = 0.83). Image quality and diagnostic confidence scores were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25 than for patients with a BMI < 25 (mean image quality score, 3.7 vs 3.4, p < 0.001; mean diagnostic confidence score, 2.8 vs 2.5, p < 0.001). The mean radiation dose for patients with a BMI < 25 was 2.4 mGy compared with 3.7 mGy for patients with a BMI >= 25 ( p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. The diagnostic performance of our low-dose CT protocol for renal colic was excellent for all patients, and image quality and diagnostic confidence were significantly better for patients with a BMI >= 25. However, our protocol also required exposure to a greater dose of radiation for these overweight and obese patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
915,"Effects of whole-body UVB irradiation on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from stage I melanoma patients Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes significant impairment of immunological function in human skin. The immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation are thought to be due to local release of cytokines by human keratinocytes, leading to impaired function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) and failure to induce cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recent studies have shown that individuals susceptible to UV-induced suppression of DTH may be more prone to develop skin cancer including malignant melanoma (MM). Since the causal relationship between UV radiation and the induction of MM still seems obscure, we investigated the immunological reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to whole-body irradiation with UVB in 15 stage I melanoma patients as compared to PBMC from normal volunteers matched for age, gender and skin type. Whole-body irradiation was performed with 0.8 minimal erythema dosages on five consecutive days. Peripheral blood was obtained before and after the procedure. Overall, there were no major effects of UVB irradiation on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and proliferation of PBMC from patients or normal controls, but UVB irradiation led to a significant increase in PWM-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-2R and TNF by PBMC. These changes were independent of the individual UVB dosages administered and appeared in both groups similarly. UVB irradiation did not lead to significant changes on IL-1 and IL-2 expression by PBMC. Our results suggest that PBMC participate in the cytokine response to UV, even in the absence of inflammatory reactions, but that this participation is not specific to MM patients.",Excluded
939,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded
1650,"Prospective comparison of extracorporeal photopheresis induced apoptosis using open-loop OPTIA collecting system and THERAFLEX-ECP OR PIT UVA illumination vs closed-loop therakos cellex system Background: Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) has been established as second-line treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (C-GVHD), enabling reduction of immunosuppressive therapy. In the USA, ECP is performed with closed-loop devices only, whereas in other countries both closed-loop and two-step open-loop systems are used. Aim(s): In the current study, collection and apoptosis cell generation using two ECP approaches were prospectively compared. Method(s): The open-loop procedure (modality A) was performed for 2 consecutive days followed by the closed-loop procedure (modality B) that was carried out for 2 consecutive days 2 weeks later. Findings on the levels of hematocrit (Hct), WBC, monocytes (mono), lymphocytes (lympho), neutrophils (neutro), product bag volume and collection duration were analyzed. Early and late apoptosis of product cells was also assessed. Specimens were collected from the product bag before adding 8-MOP and after UVA irradiation. Mononuclear cells (MNC) were separated using Lymphoprep (Axis-Shield), measured and suspended in cell culture flasks at a concentration of 4 x 106/ml in the RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated for 48 h at 37degreeC. MNC subsets (lymphocyte, monocyte) were identified by: CD3,CD4,CD8a,CD14,CD25,CD11C,CD123,CD56,DR, FoxP3, CD303,CD86 labeling. Early apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V and late apoptosis was assessed using Propidium Iodid. Result significance was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed paired test. Result(s): Procedures were performed in 12 patients with chronic GVHD (4 females, 8 males; median age 44, range 20-67 years). Thirty nine open-loop procedures and 24 (table present) closed-loop paired procedures were subjected to analysis. Results of cell collection and apoptosis are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Median Hct levels were similar in collections obtained using Spectra Optia and Cellex devices (2.2 and 2.1, respectively). No difference in apoptosis was observed between the use of Theraflex-ECP and PIT UVA illumination system. Conclusion(s): The current study demonstrated significant differences between the two ECP modalities. Despite its longer duration, the open-loop procedure resulted in significantly higher mean total MNC amount and provided a significantly higher number of early apoptotic cells in lymphocyte and monocyte gates both before and after UVA irradiation. This finding may be attributed to difference in device design. The results obtained suggest that the open-loop procedure could be efficiently employed in patients with GVHD.",Excluded

Design Retrospective case series. Setting Tertiary neurosurgical referral unit of a Hong Kong public hospital. Patients Patients with ruptured radiation-induced internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms that were treated endovascularly from October 1999 to October 2011 at Queen Elizabeth Hospital were reviewed. Hospital records, imaging, and angiographic data were studied. Results During the study period, 15 such nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated by endovascular means at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Ten presented with epistaxis, three with otorrhagia (bleeding from the ear), and two with both. Therapeutic occlusion of the affected internal carotid artery was performedin four patients, and stenting of the artery (with or without coil obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm) was performed in 11. Immediate haemostasis was achieved in all cases. One (7%) of the 15 patients endured symptomatic recurrence of the pseudoaneurysm, and in another an asymptomatic residualpseudoaneurysm was noted in the follow-up angiogram. Three patients suffered clinically significant procedure-related complications, including cerebral infarction (n=2) and brain abscess (n=1). In the angiograms obtained after a mean posttreatment interval of 13 (range, 0.7-60) months, the stent patency rate was 67%. All three patients with occluded stents were asymptomatic. Conclusions Ruptured internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms following radiotherapy is a rare but life-threatening condition. Endovascular treatment by occlusion or reconstruction of the internal carotid artery with stents provides immediate haemostasis and obliteration of the pseudoaneurysms, with a low recurrence rate. Long-term follow-up is necessary to look out for delayed posttreatment complications.",Excluded
3162,"Rationale and design of the Japan molecular epidemiology for lung cancer study We present the rationale for the Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study designed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in smokers and never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. This prospective, ongoing, multicenter study is being conducted nationwide in Japan. Although there is no doubt that active smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, the contribution of other possible factors, including environmental tobacco or wood smoke, human papilloma virus, radon, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility, is highly likely, based on studies of never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. Because of the predominance of women in the never-smoker subgroup, the role of female hormones in lung cancer development has also been considered. We hypothesize that driver mutations, which are critical for the development of lung cancer, are triggered by the environmental factors with or without the influence of the hormone. The SWOG-led intergroup molecular epidemiology study S0424 was conducted to focus on these issues by using a detailed questionnaire and specimen collection in statistically significant cohorts of smokers and never-smokers from both sexes. The Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study follows and extends the S0424 molecular epidemiology concept in principle by using a similar approach that will facilitate future comparisons between the studies but with a greater focus on more recently defined driver mutations and broad genomic sequencing.

Additionally, environmental factors, such as the X-ray, can modulate cytokine expression. Due to the fact that X-ray is used during angiography, hence, angiography may alter expression of the cytokines., OBJECTIVE: Accordingly, this project was aimed to assess IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels within cardiovascular patients (with and without vessel stenosis) versus healthy controls and also the effects of angiography on the serum levels of the cytokines., MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed on the 80 participants, including twenty cases in each group (healthy controls and cardiovascular patients without vessel stenosis, stenosis of 1 vessel and stenosis of more than 1 vessel) to evaluate IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels using ELISA technique. The IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels also compared within group 2, 3 and 4 before and after angiography to explore the effects of the technique on the IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels., RESULTS: IL-10, but not IFN-gamma, serum levels were higher in the healthy controls than all cardiovascular patients. IL-10 and IFN-gamma serum levels were not altered after angiography and also were not differ in the smoker versus non- smoker and opium consuming versus non-opium consuming participants., CONCLUSION: Due to the results it may be concluded that IL-10 can be considered as a plausible inhibitor of cardio- vascular diseases independent of angiography duration and X-ray, however, IFN-gamma has no effects in the Iranian patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases.

1368,"Lumbar disc geometry affects the risk for rod fracture in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Rod fracture (RF) has significant consequences for patients, including pain, loss of correction, and revision surgery. Risk factors associated with RF include previous spine surgery, insufficient sagittal vertical axis (SVA) correction and pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO). Increased lumbar disc geometry, regardless of PSO, SVA or previous surgery, may be a risk factor affecting RF rates. PURPOSE: To evaluate if larger disc geometry affects rod stresses adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra increasing the risk of rod fracture. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single center retrospective review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-nine patients with ASD who underwent open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rod fracture complication; lumbar disc height, diameter, and volume. METHOD(S): All patients with ASD having open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up were included. Patients were divided into 2 Groups: Group 1-patients with RF; Group 2-No RF. RESULT(S): Thirty-nine of 52 patients met inclusion criteria. Group 1-included 15/39 (38%) patients with RF all requiring revision surgery. Group 2-included 24 (62%) patients without RF. There was no difference in age, construct length, number of nonfused lumbar discs, previous spinal surgery, pre- or postoperative SVA or PSOs between the Groups (Table 1). Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. There were significant differences between the RF vs No RF Groups in L1/2 disc heights (H) (8.5 vs 6.5 mm, p=.03), L2/3 H (9.6 vs 6.7 mm, p=.015); L1/2 diameters (D) (41.4 vs 34 mm, p<.01), L2/3 D (43.2 vs 36.2 mm, p=.01); and L1/2 volumes (V) (11714 vs 7817 mm3, p=.02), L2/3 V (14025 vs 8955 mm3, p=.02), respectively. L3/4 and L4/5 disc geometry was larger in the RF Group but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION(S): The overall prevalence of RF was 38% with no differences in previous spinal surgery, SVA, or PSOs between the 2 Groups.Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. Patients with RF had significantly larger nonfused disc heights, diameters, and volumes adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra. Increased disc geometrics may allow for increased micro-motion and increased rod stresses and rates of RF.",Excluded
1338,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

2229,"Cohort profile: four early uranium processing facilities in the US and Canada PURPOSE: Pooling of individual-level data for workers involved in uranium refining and processing (excluding enrichment) may provide valuable insights into risks from occupational uranium and external ionizing radiation exposures., METHODS: Data were pooled for workers from four uranium processing facilities (Fernald, Mallinckrodt and Middlesex from the U.S.; and Port Hope, Canada). Employment began as early as the 1930s and follow-up was as late as 2017. Workers were exposed to high concentrations of uranium, radium, and their decay products, as well as gamma radiation and ambient radon decay products. Exposure and outcome data were harmonized using similar definitions and dose reconstruction methods. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated., RESULTS: In total, 560 deaths from lung cancer, 503 non-malignant respiratory diseases, 67 renal diseases, 1,596 ischemic heart diseases, and 101 dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were detected in the pooled cohort of over 12,400 workers (~1,300 females). Mean cumulative doses were 45 millisievert for whole-body external ionizing radiation exposure and 172 milligray for lung dose from radon decay products. Only SMR for dementia and AD among males was statistically significant (SMR=1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.54)., CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to date to examine long-term health risks of uranium processing workers.",Included
483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

2480,"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning in Single-Dose Total-Body Gamma-Irradiated Rhesus Monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ) In this study, the effects of a potentially lethal radiation exposure on the brain for long-term cognitive sequelae were investigated using Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) adopted from other facilities after analysis of acute radiation response via the Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR) network. Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included
2682,"Results of radiotherapy on ureteric obstruction in muscle-invasive bladder cancer OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of radiotherapy on ureteric obstruction due to muscle-invasive bladder cancer., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of the records of 574 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer revealed 90 patients (16%) with ureteric obstruction; the obstruction was bilateral in 24%. The effect of radiotherapy was assessed in 55 patients with 68 obstructed kidneys. Six patients with eight obstructed kidneys required percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteric catheters in addition to radiotherapy., RESULTS: Drainage improved in 20% of kidneys and the diverting catheter was withdrawn permanently in one (17%) of the diverted patients. The median survival was 11 months. Irradiation was followed by significant complications in 37 patients (67%)., CONCLUSION: The results of this study raise doubts about the assumed beneficial effect of irradiation on ureteric obstruction due to muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The short median survival of 11 months confirms that ureteric obstruction is a poor prognostic factor in muscle-invasive bladder cancer.",Excluded
2550,"Technological Advances in Arrhythmia Management Applied to Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease. Numerous challenges to managing arrhythmias include vascular access issues, intracardiac shunts, unconventional locations of the conduction system, and anatomical complexities. Technological advances are improving our ability to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. Implantable loop recorders and various technologies developed for consumers to record electrocardiographic tracings using smartphone applications, watches, and dedicated portable devices are expanding our armamentarium of diagnostic tools. Remote magnetic-guided catheter ablation is enhancing access to otherwise difficult to reach arrhythmia substrates. Cryoablation allows perinodal arrhythmias to be safely treated in patients with displaced or difficult to predict locations of the atrioventricular conduction system. Interventions that minimize radiation exposure to near 0 levels are gaining interest and pulmonary vein isolation procedures to treat atrial fibrillation are increasingly performed. Cardiac implantable electronic devices compatible with magnetic resonance imaging have become the norm. Subcutaneous defibrillators and leadless pacemakers are providing effective solutions to patients in whom transvenous leads are contraindicated or not desired. His-bundle pacing is emerging as a viable option to provide more physiological pacing. Progressive advances in multicomponent communicating leadless devices carry the promise of providing leadless dual chamber pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the near future. The safety of transvenous lead extraction procedures is likely to improve with advances such as the low-pressure balloon to manage superior vena cava lacerations. Awareness of these developments and referral to sites with dedicated expertise could contribute to further improving outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

2031,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included
201,"Gastrointestinal hemorrhage after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer Background/Aims: While chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is considered to be a reasonable treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), there is little information about the associated risk of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. We investigated the clinical features of GI toxicity after CRT in patients with LAPC and examined the effect of GI hemorrhage on survival. Method(s): Patients enrolled in this study had received CRT for pathologically proven LAPC. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): A total of 156 patients with LAPC (median age, 65 years; range, 39 to 90 years) who received treatment between August 2005 and March 2009 were included in this study. The most common GI toxicities were ulcer formation (25.6%) and hemorrhage (25.6%), and the most common grade 3 to grade 5 GI toxicity was hemorrhage (65%). The origins of GI hemorrhage were gastric ulcer (37.5%), duodenal ulcer (37.5%), and radiation gastritis (15.0%). The independent risk factor for GI hemorrhage was tumor location in the pancreatic body. The median overall survival of the patients with a GI hemorrhage was 13.8 months (range, 2.8 to 50.8 months) and was not significantly different from that of patients without GI hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): GI hemorrhage was common in patients with LAPC after CRT. Although GI hemorrhage was controlled with endoscopic hemostasis, preventive measures should be investigated to reduce needless suffering.",Excluded
1029,"Cancer incidence among Australian nuclear industry workers To assess whether workers at Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre (LHSTC) had different levels of cancer incidence from the New South Wales (NSW) population in Australia. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken at LHSTC. Data on 7,076 workers employed between 1957-98 were abstracted from personnel, dosimetry, and medical files. An inception cohort was defined which included 4,523 workers in employment between 1972-96 to examine cancer incidence. Cancer registrations in the inception cohort were identified to 1996 through electronic linkage of records with the NSW and the Australian national registers of cancer incidence. All-cancer incidence in workers at LHSTC was 15% below the NSW rates [SIR=0.85; 95% CI=(0.75, 0.95)]. Of 37 specific cancers and groups of cancers examined, statistically significant excesses relative to NSW rates were observed only for pleural cancer incidence [SIR=17.71; 95%=(7.96, 39.43)], and for incidence of cancer of the small intestine [SIR=4.34; 95% CI=(1.40, 13.46)]. This study gives little evidence of an increased risk of cancers associated with radiation exposure in a cohort of nuclear workers in Australia. The observed increase in the risk of cancer of the pleura was probably due to unmeasured exposures, given the lack of an established association with radiation exposure, and the strong link to asbestos exposure. Findings for cancers of the small intestine were based on small numbers and were likely to be due to chance.",Included
2481,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded
120,"Individualizing cancer treatment: biological optimization models in treatment planning and delivery PURPOSE: During the last 30 years radiation therapy has developed from classical rectangular beams via conformation therapy with largely uniform dose delivery, but irregular field shapes, to fully intensity modulated dose delivery where the total dose distribution in the tumor can be fully controlled in three dimensions. This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity., RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed., CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept.",Excluded
361,"Late side effects of radioactive iodine on salivary gland function in patients with thyroid cancer BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the late side effects of radioiodine therapy (RIT) on salivary gland function. One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

However, 10% to 30% of these patients require repeat intervention to the irradiated site., METHODS: Of 961 patients who were assigned to gamma or beta radiation for the treatment of diffuse ISR, we evaluated the outcome of 282 (29%) consecutive patients who failed IRT and compared them with the 679 (71%) patients who had successful IRT. For patients who failed radiation, the mean time to the first target vessel revascularization (TVR) was 173 +/- 127 days after the index procedure and the total duration of follow-up was 494 +/- 304 days., RESULTS: Patients who failed IRT were younger (60 +/- 10 vs. 63 +/- 11 years, p = 0.002) and had a higher incidence of restenting (51% vs. 41%, p = 0.003). The majority (55%) of the restenotic lesions after IRT failure were focal (< or =10 mm), with a mean lesion length of 11.9 +/- 1.9 mm.

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 160 patients with GBM who received treatment at our institution between 1999 and 2008. Those taking an SSRI during treatment for GBM were identified and toxicities were assessed. Result(s): Median survival for the entire cohort was 1.05 years. A total of 35 patients (21.8%) took an SSRI during initial treatment for GBM. There was no statistical difference in the rate of >=grade 3 toxicity in patients taking an SSRI when compared with those who were not (11.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively; P = 1.00). Two-year survival in the cohort of patients taking an SSRI was 32% versus 17% in those who were not (P = 0.18). After making adjustment for age, recursive partitioning analysis class, and extent of surgery, absence of an SSRI during treatment was associated with a hazard risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.00-2.42; P = 0.05).

The purpose of this study was to report on patterns of palliative RT of bone metastasis in a severely low-capacity setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient and treatment characteristics of patients irradiated for palliation of symptomatic bone metastasis were extracted from a retrospective database of patients treated between May 2015 and January 2018. This database included a random sample of 1,823 of the estimated 4,000 patients who were treated with RT within in the study period. Associations between the applied RT schedule and patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated with the chi2 test. Hypothetical savings of RT sessions and time were compared in the case of a single-fraction policy. RESULTS From the database, 234 patients (13%) were treated for bone metastasis. Most patients were <= 65 years of age (n = 189; 80%) and female (n = 125; 53%). The most common primary sites were breast (n = 82; 35%) and prostate (n = 36; 15%). Fractionated regimens were preferred over single fraction: 20 Gy in 5 fractions (n = 192; 82.1%), 30 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 7; 3%), and 8 Gy in 1 fraction (n = 28; 12%). Factors associated with single-fraction RT included nonaxial sites of bone metastasis (P, .01) and an address outside Addis Ababa (P <= .01). If single-fraction RT would have been given uniformly for bone metastasis, this would have resulted in a 78% reduction in the number of RT sessions and 76% reduction in total RT time. CONCLUSION The pattern of palliative RT for bone metastasis in Ethiopia favors fractionated regimens over single fraction.

342,"Malignant melanoma risk by nativity, place of residence at diagnosis, and age at migration Although geographic latitude is clearly linked to the risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, the chronology of this link is unclear. Based on the 4,611 cases of melanoma with known place of nativity diagnosed in 1972-82 among the non-Latino White residents of Los Angeles County (California, United States) of known place of origin, migrants to Los Angeles from higher US latitudes enjoy relative safety from skin melanoma. This relative safety is largely unaffected by the interval since migration, even after decades of residence in Los Angeles. The same relative protection is enjoyed by native residents of more northerly US communities in comparison with co-resident migrants from the southwestern US. While the observed effect of latitude is consistent with the accepted importance of solar radiation as a determinant of melanoma risk, it suggests that early, rather than late or cumulative, exposure is of most importance. This finding does not affirm the belief that protection of adult skin from exposure to the sun will reduce the risk from melanoma.

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included

There is also a need for shaped demineralized bone matrices made from cancellous bone, where the properties of the material allow its insertion into defects, therefore acting as a void filler and scaffold onto which new bone can form. In this study, we report that demineralized bone sponges were prepared by dissecting and cutting knee bone into cancellous bone cubes of 1 cm3. These cubes were then taken through a series of warm water washes, some with sonication, centrifugation, and two decontamination chemical washes. The cubes were optimally demineralized into sponges with 0.5N hydrochloric acid under vacuum with constant pH measurement. Demineralization was confirmed by quantitative measurement of calcium and qualitatively by compression. The sponges were freeze dried before terminal sterilisation with a target dose of 25 kGy gamma radiation whilst frozen. Samples of the sponges were histologically examined for calcium and collagen and also tested for osteoinductivity. Data showed well defined collagen staining in the sponges, with little residual calcium. Sponges from two out of three donors demonstrated osteoinductivity when implanted into the muscle of an athymic mouse.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU.

129,"[Large mantle fields--indication, technic, tolerance and side effects] In our Department, the technique of large mantle fields has proved to be a good therapeutic means for supradiaphragmatic and infradiaphragmatic irradiation of several lymph node groups in one irradiation field. With this technique the lymph node groups needing a treatment can be irradiated without overlappings or gaps, and thus the therapy reliability is considerably improved. The side effects are limited with respect to the large volume dose, in the individual case they can easily be eliminated by reducing the single dose. Gastrointestinal side effects can be controlled by chemotherapy in a satisfactory manner. Only in very few cases the modifications of the white blood count necessitated a short interruption of the therapy cycle. Furthermore, the simplified and easily reproducible focussing of the individual fields is especially appreciated by the technical staff.",Excluded
210,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome. Second-look surgery and resection of residual/ refractory tumors is always recommended.",Excluded
2043,"Evaluate of the effect of low tube voltage on the radiation dosage using 640-slice coronary CT angiography BACKGROUND: 640-slice coronary CT angiography is becoming an accurate and reliable method of diagnosing coronary heart disease. However, how to reduce the radiation dosage while ensuring the clinically acceptable image quality remains a quite challenging issue., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of low tube voltage on radiation dosage under 640-slice coronary CT angiography (CCTA)., METHODS: Four hundred patients (236 males, 164 females) with coronary heart disease and underwent CCTA using DCVT were classified into A1 (tube voltage: 120 kV; exposure phase window: 30-80%), B1 (120 kV; 70-80%), A2 (100 kV; 30-80%) and B2 group (100 kV; 70-80%), respectively. Image qualities and effective dose (ED) were assessed and compared., RESULTS: No significant differences were observed among the groups in terms of age, height, weight and body mass index (BMI) (P > 0.05). ED were significantly lower in 100 kV group (P < 0.05). CT values of coronary artery in 100 kV groups were 13.5% and 17.3% higher than 120 kV group. ED in B1 group were 64.5% and 67.0% lower than A1 group. ED in B2 group were 65.4% and 65.2% lower than A2 group., CONCLUSION: When using a 640-slice CCTA prospective ECG-gating scanning mode, it is preferable to use a 100 kV tube voltage setting because compared to 120 kV tube voltage protocol, it seems to significantly decrease the mean effective radiation dose, without significantly lowering both the subjective and objective image quality.",Excluded

984,"Prognostic factors and prevention of radioembolization-induced liver disease UNLABELLED: Radioembolization (RE)-induced liver disease (REILD) has been defined as jaundice and ascites appearing 1 to 2 months after RE in the absence of tumor progression or bile duct occlusion. Our aims were to study the incidence of REILD in a large cohort of patients and the impact of a series of changes introduced in the processes of treatment design, activity calculation, and the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose steroids (modified protocol). Between 2003 and 2011, 260 patients with liver tumors treated by RE were studied (standard protocol: 75, modified protocol: 185). REILD appeared only in patients with cirrhosis or in noncirrhosis patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy prior to RE. Globally, the incidence of REILD was reduced in the modified protocol group from 22.7% to 5.4% and the incidence of severe REILD from 13.3% to 2.2% (P<0.0001). Treatment efficacy was not jeopardized since 3-month disease control rates were virtually identical in both groups (66.7% and 67.2%, P=0.93). Exposure to chemotherapy in the 2-month period following RE and being treated by the standard protocol were independent predictors of REILD among noncirrhosis patients. In cirrhosis, the presence of a small liver (total volume<1.5 L), an abnormal bilirubin (>1.2 mg/dL), and treatment in a selective fashion were independently associated with REILD., CONCLUSION: REILD is an uncommon but relevant complication that appears when liver tissue primed by cirrhosis or prior and subsequent chemotherapy is exposed to the radiation delivered by radioactive microspheres. We designed a comprehensive treatment protocol that reduces the frequency and the severity of REILD. Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded
2001,"Radiation-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication after patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receive radiotherapy using a technique that delivers 180-200 centigrays (cGy) per day. Cranial neuropathy is of particular clinical interest in terms of making a differential diagnosis, because it is also a common presenting manifestation in patients with NPC. Cranial neuropathy may lead to distressing signs and symptoms in these patients, and their treatment has not been addressed in previous reports. This article presents the authors' experience with radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with NPC., METHODS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with radiation-related neuropathy. Patients with recurrent tumors or with a suspicion of persistent or recurrent tumors were excluded. Most patients were treated using 180 cGy or 200 cGy per fraction per day. The total dose was 7000-13,000 cGy to the nasopharynx and 5000-9000 cGy to the neck. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis alone and hearing loss were not included in the analysis., RESULTS: There were 15 male patients and 4 female patients. The latency before palsy occurred was 12-240 months. Single nerve palsy developed in four patients, including two patients with hypoglossal palsy and two patients with recurrent laryngeal palsy. Two patients had three nerve palsies each. The other 13 patients presented with 2 nerve palsies each. Vagus and hypoglossal palsy appeared to be a frequent combination and occurred in 11 patients. Overall, there were 17 patients with hypoglossal palsy (7 bilateral, 8 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 11 patients with vagus palsy (2 bilateral, 7 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 6 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (5 bilateral), and 2 patients with accessory palsies (all bilateral). Marked neck fibrosis was present in 12 patients. Patients who had vocal cord paralysis suffered from easy choking and hoarseness. Severe respiratory difficulty occurred in two patients who had bilateral vocal cord palsy. Surgical procedures included laryngoplasty, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy. Quality of life improved considerably after patients underwent surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy may occur in patients with NPC after they receive conventional radiotherapy. Hypoglossal nerve palsy was found the most frequently in this series, followed by vagus nerve palsy and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Neck fibrosis and the course of the three nerves through the neck may be important risk factors for the development of palsy. The diagnosis must be made only after the possibilities of tumor-induced palsy and idiopathic palsy are excluded. Surgery is helpful in improving the quality of life in many patients.

270,"Automated synthesis and dosimetry of 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF): A radiotracer for imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer 6-Deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF) is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging GLUT5 in breast cancer. The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded
2007,"Potential risk factors and outcomes of fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy Fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following esophagectomy are a rare and severe complication with significant mortality. Treatment and therapy are difficult and require a multidisciplinary approach. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors for these fistulas following esophagetcomy, and to assess their impact on the further clinical course and outcome. 211 patients undergoing Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 2005 and 2012 were included. The preoperative risk factors including the risk score according to Schroder et al. and theO-Physiological and Operative Severity Score (POSSUM) score, operative and postoperative parameters and the outcome were evaluated. 65% of all patients developed postoperative complications, including 12 patients that developed fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway (airway fistulas [AF]; 5.6%). Neither patient related risk factors nor esophagus-specific risk scores correlated with occurrence of AF. Furthermore, surgical treatment and neoadjuvant treatment did not show any effect on development of AF in our patients. However, we could demonstrate that AF significantly impacted on length of hospital stay (AF 52 days vs. No-AF group 16 days, P < 0.001), incidence of major pulmonary complications (83.3% vs. 17.1%, P < 0.001), 90-day mortality (42% vs. 7.5%, P=0.002) and overall survival (133 days vs. 636 days, P=0.029).With the current study, we could not identify any patient related risk factors, esophagus-specific risk scores or treatment related details that might be useful as predictors of AF after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. However, we confirmed that AF significantly impacted on outcomes. This highlights the urgent need for further studies on this rare but devastating complication after esophagectomy.Copyright © 2016 International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.",Excluded
704,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.",Included

2350,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009).

This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out. The excess relative risk per sievert based on the cohort's exposed group was 0.81 (0.46; 1.33) for all solid cancers combined and thus still exceeds current risk estimates from the Life Span Study. Future epidemiological assessments based on this cohort will benefit from extension of follow-up and ongoing validation of dosimetric data.",Included
1623,"Factors contributing to radiation dose for patients and operators during diagnostic cardiac angiography INTRODUCTION: Diagnostic coronary angiography (CA) uses ionising radiation with relatively high doses, which impact on both patients and staff. This study sought to identify which patient and procedural factors impact patient and operator dose the most during CA., METHODS: Patient and procedure related variables impacting on Kerma area product (PKA ) and operator dose (OD) were collected for 16 months. Procedures were separated into 10 different procedure categories. PKA was used for patient dose and OD was measured with an instantly downloadable dosimeter (IDD) - downloaded at the end of each procedure. High and low radiation dose was defined by binary variables based on the 75th percentile of the continuous measures. Univariate and multivariate regression were used to identify predictors., RESULTS: Of 3860 patients included, the IDD was worn for 2591 (61.7%). Obesity (BMI > 30 compared to BMI < 25) was the strongest predictor for both a PKA (odds ratio (OR) = 19.1 (95% CI 13.5-26.9) P < 0.001) and OD (OR = 3.3 (2.4-4.4) P < 0.001) above the 75th percentile. Male gender, biplane imaging, the X-ray unit used, operator experience and procedure type also predicted a high PKA . Radial access, male gender, biplane imaging and procedure type also predicted a high OD., CONCLUSION: Radiation dose during CA is multifactorial and is dependent on patient and procedure related variables. Many factors impact on both PKA and OD but obesity is the strongest predictor for both patients and operators to receive a high radiation dose. Copyright © 2018 The Prince Charles Hospital.

We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05)., CONCLUSIONS: X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility.

2628,"Mechanism of low-level microwave radiation effect on nervous system The aim of this study is to explain the mechanism of the effect of low-level modulated microwave radiation on brain bioelectrical oscillations. The proposed model of excitation by low-level microwave radiation bases on the influence of water polarization on hydrogen bonding forces between water molecules, caused by this the enhancement of diffusion and consequences on neurotransmitters transit time and neuron resting potential. Modulated microwave radiation causes periodic alteration of the neurophysiologic parameters and parametric excitation of brain bioelectric oscillations. The experiments to detect logical outcome of the mechanism on physiological level were carried out on 15 human volunteers. The 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 40 and 1000 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density of 0.16 mW/cm2. A relative change in the EEG power with and without radiation during 10 cycles was used as a quantitative measure. Experimental data demonstrated that modulated at 40 Hz microwave radiation enhanced EEG power in EEG alpha and beta frequency bands. No significant alterations were detected at 7 and 1000 Hz modulation frequencies. These results are in good agreement with the theory of parametric excitation of the brain bioelectric oscillations caused by the periodic alteration of neurophysiologic parameters and support the proposed mechanism. The proposed theoretical framework has been shown to predict the results of experimental study. The suggested mechanism, free of the restrictions related to field strength or time constant, is the first one providing explanation of low-level microwave radiation effects.",Excluded

Changes in CANTAB and MADRS scores were assessed in relation to electrical dosage, initial stimulus dose, and demographic variables using linear mixed models., RESULTS: Data pertained to 143 patients (mean age, 56.85 [SD, 14.94], 43% male). Median change in CANTAB score was -10% (-20% to 5%) after 4 ECT treatments and -10% (-20% to 5%) at course completion. Median change in MADRS score was -22 (-33 to -13) after 4 ECT treatments and -14 (-25 to -7) at course completion. Electrical dosage had no effect on CANTAB or MADRS change scores either after 4 treatments or course completion. Improvement in CANTAB score at end of course was associated with female sex (P < 0.05), higher intelligence quotient (P = 0.01), and age. After 4 treatments, improvement in CANTAB score was associated with younger age (P < 0.001) and higher intelligence quotient (P < 0.01). Improved MADRS score at course completion was associated with older age (P < 0.001 at end of course and after 4 treatments)., CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy has significant antidepressant and cognitive effects which are not associated with the total electrical dose administered.

In rectal tumor patients, particularly at stage IV, the level of PHA-induced BRL and the total number of rosette-forming cells (RFC) were lower than in healthy donors. Surgery did not produce any significant changes in cell-mediated immunity parameters: level of PHA-induced BRL decreased by 16,7%, while total RFC number increased by 17.2% in (mostly low-affinity forms).

534,"Post-remission treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukaemia: A time-dependent analysis Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. Method(s): For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. Finding(s): 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Interpretation(s): Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

768,"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction: Cumulative effect of cost, radiation, and turnaround time on the patient and the health care system OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reiterate the predominance of CT in evaluating ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in terms of cost-effectiveness, reduction of radiation exposure, and turnaround time as the measurement parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older with a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of shunt malfunction and underwent shunt series radiography and head CT within 12 hours. Shunt revision occurring contemporaneously with imaging was defined as revision within 48 hours of the original imaging report. The effective radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product from the scanner with the standard conversion coefficient k (k = 0.0021 mSv/mGy x cm). The turnaround time for patients who underwent both head CT and shunt series radiography was calculated from time of the first study to the time of completion of the last study. RESULTS. There were 16 shunt revisions in 239 patients. The sensitivity of CT was 87.5%; specificity, 91.4%; positive predictive value, 42.4%; and negative predictive value, 99%. The sensitivity of shunt series radiography was 18.7%; specificity, 90.9%; positive predictive value, 13%; and negative predictive value, 93.9%. There were 223 observations of CT radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.87 +/- 0.45). There also were 223 observations of shunt radiography radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.57 +/- 0.60). The median turnaround time among patients undergoing CT and shunt radiography was 109 +/- 84 minutes. CONCLUSION. Shunt series radiography is a low-yield diagnostic imaging modality for identifying shunt malfunction and prolongs turnaround time, increases medical cost, and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
753,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancer-a phase I-II study of radiotherapy with dose escalation of weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine chemotherapy Background: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil improves gastric cancer outcome. We previously demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy with a more intensified-and therefore potentially more effective-schedule with daily cisplatin and oral capecitabine is feasible. Because such an intensive schedule requires an extensive logistic infrastructure which is not available in every hospital, we additionally investigated the tolerability of this combined regimen with weekly instead of daily cisplatin in a dose-escalation study. Patients and Methods: After R0 or R1 resection, treatment initiated with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 2 weeks and 1-week rest. Subsequently, patients received capecitabine (575-650 mg/m2 orally b.i.d., 5 days/week) and cisplatin (20-25 mg/m2 i.v., once weekly) according to a predefined dose-escalation schedule concurrent with radiation. Radiotherapy was given to a fixed total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Result(s): Thirty-one patients were eligible and started treatment. During chemoradiotherapy, seven patients developed 10 items of grade III and one episode of grade IV (mainly hematological) toxicity (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0). The maximum tolerable dose was determined to be for cisplatin 20 mg/m2 i.v. weekly and for capecitabine 575 mg/m2 b.i.d. orally. Conclusion(s): This phase I-II study demonstrated that postoperative chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine is feasible in gastric cancer at the defined dose level. This schedule is currently being tested as the experimental arm in a phase III multicenter study (CRITICS: chemoradiotherapy after induction chemotherapy in cancer of the stomach; Clinicaltrials.gov NCT 00407186). © The Author 2009.

1632,"The effect of body mass index on fluoroscopic time and radiation dose during lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections OBJECTIVE: Transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) are a commonly used, effective treatment for radicular pain. Accurate delivery of the injected medication helps to ensure maximum therapeutic efficacy and to decrease possible adverse events, and fluoroscopy is the preferred and most common image-guidance modality used to ensure accurate needle placement during lumbar TFESIs. However, fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs put patients at risk because of radiation exposure. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and fluoroscopy time and radiation dose during lumbar TFESIs., DESIGN: A retrospective study design was used., SETTING: The study was conducted at an academic orthopedic center. All procedures were performed by physicians board-certified in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) and with subspecialty certification in sports medicine, or by a trainee under close supervision from an attending physician., PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients who underwent fluoroscopic-guided lumbar TFESIs between February 2013 and March 2015 with a documented height/weight, fluoroscopy time, and radiation dose., INTERVENTIONS: All patients received unilateral or bilateral lumbar TFESIs with fluoroscopic guidance. Fluoroscopy time and dose were recorded., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were fluoroscopy time and radiation dose. A Bonferroni correction was implemented for multiple comparisons, defining statistical significance at p<.01., RESULTS: A total of 2,443 injections were performed on 1,548 patients. There were 419 normal, 572 overweight, and 557 obese patients, respectively. There were 1,426 first-time injections and 1,017 repeat injections. Sixty-nine percent (1,681) were unilateral injections, and 26.4% (645) were single level injections. A trainee was involved in 1,361 (55.7%) of the injections performed. The mean fluoroscopy time for all injections was 30.0+/-17.5 seconds, and the mean radiation dose was 2,164+/-1,484 mGy-cm(2). The mean fluoroscopy time was 27.7+/-15.2 seconds for normal weight patients, 30.0+/-21.0 seconds for overweight patients, and 32.2+/-15.1 seconds for obese patients, showing a significant difference between groups (p<.001). The mean radiation doses for each group were 1,376+/-450, 1,911+/-653, and 3,029+/-640 mGy-cm(2), respectively, with a significant increase in radiation dose with increasing BMI (p<.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study demonstrate that fluoroscopy radiation dose and fluoroscopy time during lumbar TFESIs are increased in patients with an elevated BMI, and in patients of greater age, but the presence of a trainee had no effect on fluoroscopy time.

2130,Increased risk of ischemic bowel complications during treatment with bevacizumab after pelvic irradiation: Report of three cases Purpose: To assess the rate of severe bowel complications during treatment with the antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab. Methods and Materials: We performed a retrospective evaluation of bevacizumab-associated severe intestinal adverse events from our institutional database. Result(s): A total of 33 patients started treatment with bevacizumab at our institution during the first 6 months after its approval in Germany. Three patients (9%) presented with severe bowel complications: two with acute ischemic colitis and one with gastrointestinal perforation with a fatal outcome. All 3 patients had undergone radiotherapy directed to the pelvis before treatment with bevacizumab. None of the 30 patients without bowel complications had been pretreated with infradiaphragmatic irradiation. Histologic evaluation of bowel biopsies and resection specimens revealed severe ischemic bowel damage as the pathophysiologic background of the clinical findings. Conclusion(s): This report contributes to the pathophysiologic clarification of bevacizumab-induced bowel complications and points to a potentially increased risk of severe ischemic damage during treatment with bevacizumab in patients who have undergone previous radiotherapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.,Excluded
2316,"Comparison of distal interphalangeal fusion with and without joint preparation in cases of stage IV chondropathy The main complications in distal interphalangeal (DIP) fusion are non-union and hardware-related symptoms. The primary aim of this study was to show that joint preparation for DIP fusion is not necessary in cases of stage IV chondropathy. The secondary aim was to show that use of buried compression screws decreases the complication rate. This continuous retrospective study included two groups of DIP percutaneous arthrodesis procedures carried out with 1.8. mm break-away compression screws: group 1 underwent joint preparation through a dorsal approach and group 2 underwent a percutaneous procedure without joint preparation. Group 1 included 15 patients (18 fingers) with a mean age of 65.3 years, representing nine cases of osteoarthritis, four cases of open trauma, one of gout, and one of rheumatoid arthritis. Group 2 included 18 patients (21 fingers) with a mean age of 58.9 years, representing 16 cases of osteoarthritis, one of rheumatoid arthritis and one of swan-neck deformity. Tourniquet time was longer in group 1 (61. min) than in group 2 (24. min). The amount of emitted ionizing radiation was not different between groups. Pain and QuickDASH scores were not improved in group 1 but they were in group 2. There was no difference in the fusion time. One non-union was observed in group 1. Our results show that joint preparation for DIP arthrodesis is unnecessary in stage IV chondropathy. No hardware-related complications were observed.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.",Excluded
1197,"Dose-dependent shift of apoptotic and unaltered melanocytes into the dermis after irradiation with UVA 1 BACKGROUND: Intense UVA irradiation induces an increase in number, size and activity of intraepidermal melanocytes. The number of melanocytes and the activity of melanogenesis return to normal after cessation of irradiation., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of reduction of melanocytes by apoptosis to prevent an uncontrolled increase in melanocytes within the epidermis., METHODS: The position of the melanocytes before and after UVA 1 irradiation was controlled by electronmicroscopy and histochemistry using Fontana-Masson staining. The status of apoptosis was demonstrated immunohistologically by the use of p53 and bcl2., RESULTS: A dose-dependent shift of melanocytes into the corium could be demonstrated. At low irradiation doses (20 J/cm2) pendulous melanocytes protrude into the dermis without losing contact to the dermoepidermal basement membrane. Higher irradiation doses (60 J/cm2) lead to a total elimination of fibrillary degenerated, apoptotic or even morphologically intact melanocytes into the corium. Once transported into the corium, the melanocytes can be detected there for more than 4 years., CONCLUSION: This shift mechanism seems to regulate and control UV-induced proliferation of epidermal melanocytes.",Excluded
3330,"Endovascular beta-radiation to reduce restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty: Results of the beta energy restenosis trial (BERT) Background - In the porcine overstretch injury model of restenosis, endovascular beta-radiation reduces neointima formation. To determine whether this therapy could be applied to patients with coronary artery disease, a special device was developed to allow delivery of 12 encapsulated 90Sr/Y sources, measuring a total of 30 mm, to various sites within the coronary arterial tree. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of the delivery of 12, 14, or 16 Gy at 2 mm after balloon angioplasty of stenoses of native coronary vessels. Methods and Results - Delivery of beta-radiation was attempted in 23 patients after successful balloon angioplasty. Source delivery was successful in 21 of the 23 patients (91%). There was no in- hospital or 30-day morbidity or mortality. Follow-up quantitative coronary arteriography in 20 patients demonstrated a late loss of 0.05 mm, a late loss index of 4%, and a restenosis rate of 15%. The use of the beta-emitter 90Sr/Y significantly reduced treatment time and operator exposure compared with previous trials with the gamma-emitter 192Ir. Conclusions - In this study, the administration of endovascular beta-radiation after angioplasty was safe and feasible and substantially altered the postangioplasty late lumen loss, resulting in a lower-than-expected rate of restenosis. On the basis of these encouraging results, a multicenter, randomized trial with operators and patients blinded to treatment assignment is planned.",Excluded

Method(s): From 2013 to 2016, 12 patients (7 men, 5 women; mean age, 61 y; range, 40-75 y) with metastatic prostate or breast carcinoma suspected either on imaging or because of biochemical progression underwent 14 percutaneous biopsies after diagnostic PET/CT using 89Zr-labeled radiotracers (mean dose, 180 MBq; range, 126-189 MBq) targeting prostatespecific membrane antigen (n 5 7) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (n 5 5). Biopsy was performed within a PET/CT suite without radiotracer reinjection. Result(s): There were no complications in any biopsies, which were performed a mean of 6.2 d (range, 0-13 d) after injection of the radiotracer. The biopsy sites were bone (n 5 7), pleura (n 5 3), lymph nodes (n 5 2), and liver (n 5 2). On pathologic examination of the biopsy samples, all were positive for malignancy. The initial diagnostic imaging findings were concordant with the biopsy results. The additional radiation (mean dose-length product) due to the CT procedures was 1,581 mGy/cm (range, 379-2,686 mGy/cm).

2637,"Effects of variable power on tissue ablation dynamics during magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy with the Visualase system Purpose: Magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various intracranial pathologies. This study investigated the effects of variable power on maximal estimated thermal damage during ablation and duration required to reach maximal ablation. Materials/Methods: All ablations were performed using the Visualase Thermal Therapy System (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), which uses a 980 nm diffusing tip diode laser. Cases were stratified into low, medium and high power. Maximal thermal damage estimate (TDEmax) achieved in a single plane and time to reach maximal damage (ttdemax) were measured and compared between groups using a 2x3 Fixed Factor Analysis of Covariance. Ablation area change for cases in which an initial thermal dose was followed by a subsequent dose, with increased power, was also assessed. Result(s): We used real-time ablation data from 93 patients across various intracranial pathologies. ttdemax (mean +/- SEM) decreased linearly as power increased (low: 139.2 +/- 10.4 s, medium: 127.5 +/- 4.3 s, high: 103.7 +/- 5.8 s). In cases where a second thermal dose was delivered at higher power, the TDE expanded an average of 51.4 mm2 beyond the initial TDE generated by the first ablation, with the second ablation approaching TDEmax at a higher rate than the initial ablation. Conclusion(s): Increased power results in a larger TDEmax and an increased ablation rate. In cases where an initial thermal dose does not fully ablate the target lesion, a second ablation at higher power can increase the area of ablation with an increased ablation rate.Copyright © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
2925,"Radiotherapy of Primary or Recurrent Bladder Cancer in the Very Elderly AIM: The number of very elderly patients with cancer is growing and requires particular attention. The role of organ-sparing irradiation in patients with bladder cancer aged >=80 years was investigated., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 29 very elderly (>=80 years) patients irradiated for bladder cancer, 12 characteristics were analysed for survival: indication, gender, age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), T-/N-category, tumour grade, pack years, smoking during irradiation, radiation dose, interruption of irradiation >5 days and concurrent chemotherapy., RESULTS: On univariate analysis, primary treatment (p=0.001), KPS >70 (p=0.026) and not smoking during radiotherapy (p<0.001) were associated with better survival. A strong trend for such association was observed for female gender (p=0.054), <40 pack years (p=0.064) and concurrent chemotherapy (p=0.061), and a trend for no interruption of irradiation (p=0.09). On multivariate analysis, primary treatment (p=0.006) and not smoking during radiotherapy (p=0.038) maintained significance., CONCLUSION: Very elderly patients irradiated for bladder cancer may benefit from concurrent chemotherapy. Smoking during irradiation and interruptions of irradiation should be avoided. Copyright© 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

1386,"Does the effectiveness of recanalisation of chronic occlusion depend on the location of the obstruction? Aims: Reports concerning the efficacy of recanalisation of chronic coronary total occlusion (CTO) depending on occlusion site are inconsistent. Some of them indicate a lower effectiveness of recanalisation of the circumflex artery (Cx). Methods and Results: Between January 2011 and February 2015, 252 CTO procedures in 242 patients were performed. Characteristics of the occlusions, the procedures performed and the effectiveness of revascularisation among various coronary arteries were compared. In the study group, most of the patients were men - 201 (83.1%) - and 41 (16.9%) were women. The average age was 62.4+/-9.3 years. The incidence of the risk factors was: hypertension - 86.8% (n=211), hypercholesterolaemia - 99.1% (n=241), diabetes - 29.2% (n=71), smoking - 20.6% (n=50) and history of smoking - 58.0% (n=141). The artery most often opened was the right coronary artery (RCA) - 49.0% (n=125), followed by the left anterior descending (LAD) 32.9% (n=84) and the circumflex branch 18.1% (n=46). There were no differences in the duration of the occlusions among subsequent arteries. There was a difference in length of occlusion (mm): RCA - 30.5+/-13.5, LAD - 25.5+/-9.9, Cx - 20.2+/-8.3 (p<0.05 for all changes). J-CTO score for each coronary artery was as follows: 0 - 10.9% LAD (n=9) 23.9% Cx (n=11), 11.0% RCA (n=14); 1 - 31.7% LAD (n=26), 45.6% Cx (n=21), 22.8% RCA (n=29); 2 - LAD 37.8% (n=31), 19.6% Cx (n=9), 38.5% RCA (n=49); >=3 - LAD 19.5% (n=16), 10.9% Cx (n=5), 27.5% RCA (n=34). Mean J-CTO score for LAD was 2.19+/-0.95, for Cx 2.13+/-1.14, and for RCA 2.29+/-1.07 (p=NS between arteries). The longest procedure time of the revascularisation was PCI of the RCA (77.1+/-34.9 min, p<0.05 relative to the remaining vessels). Procedure time between the LAD (65.9+/-28.8 min) and the Cx (56.6+/-26 8 min) did not differ significantly. Fluoroscopy time was also the longest during PCI of the RCA (31.0+/-19.2 min, p<0.005 relative to other arteries), and did not differ between Cx (20.0+/-12.2 min) and LAD (25.3+/-16.8 min). There was no difference in the radiation dose (Gy): 2.5+/-1.7 vs. 2.2+/-1.3 vs. 2.5+/-1.3 (RCA, Cx and LAD, respectively) among vessels. The volume of contrast was similar during PCI of the RCA and LAD (365.8+/-161.6 vs. 371.3+/-149.4 mL, p=NS) and was significantly higher in comparison to PCI of the Cx (279.6+/-150.9 mL). The reverse technique (retrograde) was used most frequently during PCI of the RCA (30.4%, n=38), then LAD (19.1%, n=16) and significantly less during PCI of the Cx (4.4%, n=2). The number of implanted stents was significantly higher in PCI of the RCA (1.9+/-0.8) and did not differ between the LAD (1.3+/-0.6) and Cx (1.1+/-0.4). There was no difference in the incidence of complications depending on the artery opened: there was 1 stroke and 1 myocardial infarction during PCI of the RCA and 2 smaller perforations during PCI of the LAD and Cx. One tamponade was observed during PCI of the RCA. Efficacy of recanalisation was similar for all of the arteries: 82.4% for the RCA (n=103), 84.5% for the LAD (n=71), and 91.3% for the Cx (n=46). Conclusion(s): The most common artery we revascularised was the right coronary artery. It was characterised by the longest length of occlusion and required the longest procedure time and fluoroscopy time. Furthermore, it required the highest amount of contrast medium and number of implanted stents. Nevertheless, the efficacy was similar for all vessels.",Excluded
1092,"Biopsy of pleural thickenings with pocket size ultrasound device Introduction:Pleural pathology diagnosis is based on the collection of cytological and histological samples. The use of image techniques is becoming more popular to increase accuracy and safety. TAC-guided thoracic biopsy is the most commonly used method but thoracic ultrasound offers some advantages like: absence of ionizing radiations and bedside exploration. Our aim was to analyze effectiveness and safety of the ultrasound-guided pleural biopsies using a pocket size ultrasound device (PSUD). Method(s): A prospective, one-year study from January 2016 to January 2017 was carried out. We included all patients with pleural thickening greater than 3 mm. Pleural biopsy was performed with a 14G gauge automatic needle (Acecut. TSK). Biopsy was completely echo-guided. Result(s):The samples were tagged as adequate sample (AS) or non-adequate sample (NAS) depending on the presence of mesothelium evidenced by the pathologist. Adequate samples (AS) were also tagged as diagnostic samples (DAS) or non-diagnostic samples (NDAS). We enrolled 32 patients. 68.8% were males, mean age of 53 (ED: 31). Biopsy was performed without need of hospitalization in 50 % of the cases. We obtained 26 AS (84.4%). 96.4% of them were diagnostic (DAS). Only one case showed further evidence of pleural involvement in a negative biopsy (mediastinal pleura). The only complication in all the biopsies performed was a pneumothorax without clinical repercussion in a pleural nodule biopsy without pleural effusion. The patient was treated with a conservative approach. Conclusion(s):PSUD is a useful tool to increases effectiveness and safety of the histologic diagnosis of pleural thickening.",Excluded
3405,"The use of intraoperative neuroimaging tools and a navigation system in surgical treatment of primary and metastatic tumors of the spine INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment of spinal tumors is associated with a high risk of intraoperative complications, including injury to the spinal cord, its roots, and large vessels both during tumor resection and at the stabilization stage during implantation of pedicular or corporal screws. The use of intraoperative neuroimaging tools and a navigation system in surgical treatment of oncological diseases of the spine enables identifying the location and extension of a tumor lesion directly in the operating room, which provides control of the resection area and the possibility of the spine stabilization under disturbed anatomy conditions when bone density is altered by the osteolytic process or systemic changes. Also, the risk of injury to the major blood vessels is reduced., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Surgical treatment of 156 patients with primary and metastatic tumors of the spine was performed at the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute in the period from 2002 to December 2014. Twelve patients underwent diagnostic intervention (transcutaneous biopsy), and 35 patients underwent surgery using intraoperative CT and a navigation systems. The indication for biopsy using both CT and the navigation system was the presence of a spinal tumor not verified by a pathomorphological examination. An O-arm intraoperative computed tomography scanner and a Medtronic's StealthStation S7 Navigation System were used in all cases., CONCLUSION: The use of both CT and the navigation system provides high quality treatment and significantly reduces radiation exposure to the medical personnel and patient. The possibility of intraoperative identification of the location and extension of a tumor in bone tissue facilitates adequate tumor resection within the intact surgical margin, with the surrounding vessels and neurological structures being under real-time control.",Excluded
2277,"Five-year outcome of stand-alone fusion using carbon cages in cervical disc arthrosis From January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2003, in the Neurosurgery Department of Rome University o ""Sapienza,"" 167 patients underwent anterior surgery for cervical spondylodiscoarthrosis. The levels treated by the anterior stand-alone technique were: C3-C4 (11%), C4-C5 (19%), C5-C6 (40%), and C6-C7 (30%). All patients underwent left anterior presternocleidomastoid-precarotid approach, microdiscectomy, and interbody fusion using a carbon fiber cage filled with hydroxyapatite. All patients were discharged within 48 h after surgery with cervical orthosis. In one case, a hematoma of the surgical site occurred within 12 h of surgery; for this reason the patient underwent surgical revision and was discharged 4 days later. All patients have worn cervical orthosis for a mean period of 7 weeks and underwent radiological follow-up with cervical RX at 1 and 3 months after surgery. All patients underwent follow-up from 54 to 90 months after surgery, and all of them underwent cervical RX, cervical CT scans for the estimate of fusion, and evaluation of neurological status using VAS and NDI. Of 167 patients, 132 were cooperative for this study, 18 were non-cooperative, and 17 died. The estimation of fusion made by cervical CT scans with sagittal reconstruction showed complete osteointegration of the cage in 115 patients (87.1%), while it showed pseudoarthrosis in 17 patients (12.9%). In 24 patients, we observed adjacent segment degeneration, and 13 of these underwent new surgical procedures in this institute or in another hospital. Clinical evaluation with VAS and NDI showed a good outcome, with poorest benefit in patients over 60 years. The clinical analysis showed a good fusion rate in according with literature, 13% of non-fusion rate without clinical evidence and 20% of ASDegeneration but only 10% had required new surgery. We also observed that patients over 60 years of age had less satisfactory outcome, probably related with the evolution of pathophysiological degeneration of the cervical spine. In the opinion, pseudoarthrosis is caused by malpositioning of the carbon fiber cage. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

1737,"Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated disease defined by prescription for oral vancomycin therapy BACKGROUND: The association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is controversial. In this study we re-examined a previously reported association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the development of community-acquired CDAD, this time using an alternative case definition of the disease., METHODS: We performed a case-control study of community-acquired CDAD using a United Kingdom clinical research database. Patients receiving oral vancomycin therapy were identified as having CDAD, the only indication for this drug. Each case subject was matched with up to 10 control subjects. Neither the cases nor the controls had been admitted to hospital in the year before the date of the vancomycin prescription (index date). Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for key covariates., RESULTS: We identified 317 cases of community-acquired CDAD treated with oral vancomycin therapy and 3167 matched control subjects. Exposure to a proton pump inhibitor in the 90 days before the index date was associated with an increased risk of CDAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.2). Antibiotic exposure in the 90 days before the index date was also a significant risk factor for community-acquired CDAD (OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.1- 11.0), even though 45% of the case subjects had not received a prescription for an antibiotic during that period. Certain comorbidities, in particular renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant disease, as well as prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, were also associated with an increased risk., INTERPRETATION: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired CDAD, when cases were defined by receipt of prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure was also a significant risk factor, but a significant proportion of the patients with community-acquired CDAD had no such exposure.",Excluded

1998,"The metabolic effects of abdominal irradiation in man with and without dietary therapy with an elemental diet The metabolic effects of abdominal radiotherapy were assessed in patients with pelvic neoplasms, and the effects of supplementation of the diet with an 'elemental' diet assessed. Therapeutic irradiation led to significant mean weight losses of 1.4 kg in control patients and 1.0 kg in patients receiving 'elemental' diet supplements. Irradiation was associated with small falls in plasma potassium and calcium concentrations in both groups. In the 'elemental' group there was a small increase in circulating alanine and insulin concentrations and a fall in glycerol and ketone body concentrations, but all variables remained within or close to normal basal reference ranges. Plasma albumin fell slightly but significantly in the 'elemental' diet group from 44 +/- 1 to 42 +/- 1 g/litre during treatment.

831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

1179,"A single antegrade intramedullary k-wire for fifth metacarpal neck fractures OBJECTIVES: Antegrade intramedullary nailing (AIMN) using 2k-wires seems to be superior to other modalities in treating displaced fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck (FFMN). Few reports demonstrated similar results retrospective with a single k-wire. The aim of the study is to describe our single k-wire technique and evaluate the related results. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective study of a continuous series of patients treated with a single intramedullary k-wire for FFMN. It includes 30 patients who met the criteria for surgery: a dorsal angulation of more than 30degree, malrotation, or both. The mean clinical follow-up period was 7+/-14.9 months. RESULT(S): The mean pre-operative angle was 50degree+/-11.35degree and the mean immediate post-operative angle was 4.86degree+/-2.8degree. The mean immediate correction was 47degree+/-9.3degree. The mean correction at last follow-up was 45.14degree+/-8.55degree. Healing was obtained in all patients and bone union was achieved at a mean of 5.6+/-1.2 weeks. The mean operative time was 8.5 min. The mean C-arm usage (number of clicks) was 7.2 times. The mean exposure radiation time was calculated at 3.6 s. The mean radiation dose was 0.08 mGy/mm2. The mean satisfaction score was 1.26+/-0.45. Quick-DASH and EQ-5D scores yielded excellent values. CONCLUSION(S): With potential benefits like lesser surgical time, radiation and cost, the use of a single AIMN could be safer, quicker and cheaper while reproducing similar clinical, functional and radiological outcomes to those reported with the use of 2k-wires.",Excluded
1410,"Individual, Environmental, and Meteorological Predictors of Daily Personal Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure Measurements in a United States Cohort Study Background: Individual exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is challenging to measure, particularly for diseases with substantial latency periods between first exposure and diagnosis of outcome, such as cancer. To guide the choice of surrogates for long-term UVR exposure in epidemiologic studies, we assessed how well stable sun-related individual characteristics and environmental/meteorological factors predicted daily personal UVR exposure measurements. Method(s): We evaluated 123 United States Radiologic Technologists subjects who wore personal UVR dosimeters for 8 hours daily for up to 7 days (N = 837 days). Potential predictors of personal UVR derived from a self-administered questionnaire, and public databases that provided daily estimates of ambient UVR and weather conditions. Factors potentially related to personal UVR exposure were tested individually and in a model including all significant variables. Result(s): The strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure in the full model were ambient UVR, latitude, daily rainfall, and skin reaction to prolonged sunlight (R2 = 0.30). In a model containing only environmental and meteorological variables, ambient UVR, latitude, and daily rainfall were the strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure (R2 = 0.25). Conclusion(s): In the absence of feasible measures of individual longitudinal sun exposure history, stable personal characteristics, ambient UVR, and weather parameters may help estimate long-term personal UVR exposure.",Excluded

2691,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for oligo-recurrent lung metastases from colorectal cancer: A feasibility study Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for oligo-recurrent lung tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC). Method(s): From May 1997 to October 2012, 34 consecutive patients with oligo-recurrent pulmonary metastases from CRC were treated with CIRT. The patients were not surgical candidates for medical reasons or patient refusal. Using a respiratory-gated technique, carbon ion therapy was delivered with curative intent using 4 coplanar beam angles. A median dose of 60 GyE (range, 44-64.8 GyE) was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV), with a median daily dose of 15 GyE (range, 3.6-44 GyE). Treatment outcome was analyzed in terms of local control rate (LCR), survival rate, and treatment-related complications. Result(s): In total, 34 patients with 44 oligo-recurrent pulmonary lesions were treated with CIRT. Median follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 2- and 3-year actuarial LCRs of the treated patients were 85.4% +/- 6.2% and 85.4% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Overall survival was 65.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 years, and 50.1% +/- 10.5% at 3 years. Although survival rates were relatively worse in the subsets of patients aged < 63 years or with early metastasis (< 36 months after resection of primary site), these factors were not significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). All treatment-related complications were self-limited, without any grade 3-5 toxicity. Conclusion(s): CIRT is one of the most effective nonsurgical treatments for colorectal lung metastases, which are relatively resistant to stereotactic body radiotherapy. CIRT is considered to be the least invasive approach even in patients who have undergone repeated prior thoracic metastasectomies. © 2014 Takahashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
69,"Changes in boundary extension effect during spatial confinement Changes in perception during space missions are usually attributed to microgravity. However, additional factors, such as spatial confinement, may contribute to changes in perception. We tested changes in scene perception using a boundary extension (BE) paradigm during a 105-day Earth-based space-simulation study. In addition to the close-up/wide-angle views used in BE, we presented two types of scenes based on the distance from the observer (proximal/distant scenes). In crew members (n = 6), we found that BE partly increased over time, but the size of BE error did not change in the control group (n = 22). We propose that this effect is caused by an increasing BE effect in stimuli that depict distant scenes and is related to spatial confinement. The results might be important for other situations of spatial confinement with restricted visual depth (e.g., submarine crew, patients confined to a bed). Generally, we found a larger BE effect in proximal scenes compared with the distant scenes. We also demonstrated that with no feedback, subjects preserve the level of the BE effect during repeated measurements. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Excluded

Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method (SPSS version 17). Result(s): We identified 22 patients of ENB diagnosed at our centre from 2009-10. Altogether 4 patients were excluded due to attrition & 18 patients were evaluable. Median age at diagnosis was 29 years (Range 3-67 years). A male preponderance was noted (male:female = 2:1). Tumour stage was Kadish B in 7 & Kadish C in 11 patients. Cervical lymphadenopathy was noted in 4 patients at presentation. Common symptoms included epistaxis in 50%; nasal obstruction, proptosis & visual dimness in 27.77% each & nasal mass in 16.66% patients. 11/18 patients underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was used in all patients-16 with radical intent (median dose 60 Gy; range45-70 Gy) & 2 with palliative intent (range 8-30 Gy/1-10fractions). Radiation plan was 2 dimensional using telecobalt in 2 patients & 3 dimensional using megavoltage X-rays in 16 patients. Treatment volume encompassed the gross tumour with a safety margin of 1-2 cm. Neck was addressed in patients with involved nodes. Common field arrangement included 2 anterior oblique or anterolateral or superior & inferior vetex beams. Chemotherapy was used in the following setting: neoadjuvant in 10 patients (common regimens CAPcyclophosphamide, adriamycin & cisplatin; EP-etoposide & cisplatin; VACvincristine, actinomycinD, cyclophosphamide), concurrent in 3 patients with weekly cisplatin & adjuvant in 5 patients with EP regimen. 7 patients had died at last follow-up with causes being local recurrence in 2, nodal recurrence in 2, distant dissemination in 3 (metastases in bone, brain & chest wall respectively), disease persistence in1 & unknown in 1.

Using data from our hospital information system, we selected patients assigned a trauma code, according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases, and with three or more body lesions assessed by CT at the same time in the emergency department. Each CT conducted was categorized into 'CT related to the final diagnosis' or 'CT unrelated to final diagnosis'. The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

579,"Selecting the best noninvasive imaging test to guide treatment after an inconclusive exercise test Opinion statement: The first step towards approaching a patient with an inconclusive stress test is to identify the initial reason why a stress test was ordered and examine what factors led to inconclusive test results. Next, it is important to ask whether the patient will benefit from further testing, as not all patients with inconclusive test results require additional testing. In patients who are at low-to-intermediate risk, it may be useful to perform coronary CT angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Among individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease, a possible advantage of CTA is that if subclinical atherosclerosis is identified, intensification of lifestyle interventions, and often pharmacotherapy, should be advocated. On the other hand, in high-risk patients or individuals that already have coronary artery disease, the primary objective is to quantify the presence and magnitude of ischemia in order to define the potential role of coronary revascularization procedures. This can be achieved by myocardial perfusion imaging using nuclear imaging or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, a functional evaluation to identify stress-induced wall motion abnormalities using stress echocardiography or MRI can be obtained. In selecting which test to obtain, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of different imaging tests and to consider patient factors (e.g., body habitus) that may influence the accuracy of various tests. In addition, physicians should consider whether there are any other clinical questions that require imaging. For instance, cardiac MRI may be used to evaluate for infiltrative myocardial disease or pericardial disease whereas cardiac CT can evaluate for lung pathology or diseases of the aorta. Finally, any decision regarding what type of additional testing to obtain should also be based on knowing the local expertise and availability of various testing options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
279,"Role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in DNA strand break repair through homologous recombination In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded

3039,"A minimally invasive assay for individual assessment of the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity Ionizing radiation induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) which activate the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through transcription of genes including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This pathway prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis as demonstrated in heritable syndromes (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT); Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Here, a simple assay based on gene expression in peripheral blood to measure accurately ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity is described. The expression of p21, Puma and Sesn2 was determined in blood from mice with different gene copy numbers of Atm, Trp53 (p53), Chek2 or Arf and in human blood and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocyte (MSTL) cultures from AT, AT carriers, LFS patients and controls, both before and after ex vivo ionizing irradiation. Mouse Atm/Chek2/p53 activity was highly dependent on the copy number of each gene except Arf. In human MSTL, an AT case, AT carriers and LFS patients showed responses distinct from healthy donors. The relationship between gene copy number and transcriptional induction upon radiation was linear for p21 and Puma and correlated well with cancer incidence in p53 variant mice. This reliable blood test provides an assay to determine ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity and demonstrates the feasibility of assessing the activity of this essential cancer protection pathway in simple assays. These findings may have implications for the individualized prediction of cancer susceptibility. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded

We found that, on average, the density of epidermal melanocytes 14 days after exposure to 2 minimal erythemal dose (MED) SSUVR was twofold higher than baseline (unirradiated) skin. However, the change in epidermal melanocyte counts among people carrying germline MC1R variants (97% increase) was significantly less than those with wild-type MC1R (164% increase; P = 0.01). We also found that sunscreen applied to the skin before exposure to 2 MED SSUVR completely blocked the effects of DNA damage, p53 induction, and cellular proliferation in both melanocytes and keratinocytes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

From the dawn of the space age, it has been the quest of humankind to understand its place in the universe. While nations can and do solve problems independently, it takes nations, working together, to accomplish great things. The formation of the JWG provided an opportunity for the opening of a series of productive relationships between the superpowers, the US and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR); and served as a justification for continued relationship for medical assistance in spaceflight, and to showcase Earth benefits from space medicine research. This relationship has been played out on an international scale with the construction and operation of the International Space Station. The fundamental reason for this successful endeavor is a direct result of the spirit and perseverance of the men and women who have worked diligently side-by-side to promote science and move our understanding of space forward. This manuscript provides a historical perspective of the JWG; how it came about; its evolution; what it accomplished; and what impact it has had and continues to have in the 21st century with regard to human spaceflight and space life sciences research.

510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies.

At the same time the metaboreflex responses of HR and MAP were unchanged. The attenuated HR response to central command was likely of baroreflex origin. Together with a parallel study of PECO after dynamic leg exercise, our data indicate that central processing of metaboreflex inputs is unchanged in microgravity whereas metaboreflex inputs from weight-bearing muscles are enhanced.",Excluded
2055,"Prognosis of severe lymphopenia after postoperative radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: Results of a long-term follow up study Purpose: To investigate the incidence and prognosis of severe radiation-induced lymphopenia (sRIL) after postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for resected NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Between 1998 and 2017, 170 patients treated with PORT for NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphopenia was divided into tertiles with severe lymphopenia defined as absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 0.37 x 103/ul. Result(s): sRIL was observed in 32.3% of patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated sRIL was associated with planning target volume radiation fraction numbers (OR 1.09, p = 0.005) and total lung mean dose (OR 1.12, p = 0.006). With a median follow-up time of 12.2 years, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 14.8 months and 28.4 months respectively in patients with sRIL, vs. 21.7 months (p = 0.008) and 48.3 months (p = 0.01) respectively in patients without sRIL. Multivariable analyses indicated sRIL significantly decreased OS (HR 1.95, p < 0.01). Since PORT for stage I-II NSCLC was done largely for positive margins, which may confound the contribution of severe RIL, we analyzed stage III separately and found that sRIL also significantly decreased OS (HR 1.88, p = 0.004) in multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): For this long-term outcome study, severe RIL correlated with total lung mean dose and radiation fractionation numbers, and was a strong prognostic factor for poor survival in PORT patients, particularly in patients with stage III NSCLC, highlighting the importance of an intact immune system for post-radiation immunologic disease surveillance.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
2190,"Imaging signs and diagnosis of bone echinococcosis Objective: To evaluate the value of imaging investigations in the diagnosis of bone echinococcosis by analysing the X-ray, CT and MRI signs. Method(s): Imaging data of 7 patients aged from 23 to 56 years (mean age 39.5 years) with bone echinococcosis were analysed retrospectively. All cases underwent X-ray plain film examination (frontal view and lateral view); 4 cases were examined with CT; 3 cases received MRI scan. Result(s): The echinococcosis located in skull (1 case), vertebrae (3 cases), sacrum (1 case), ilium (1 case) and ribs (1 case) respectively. X-ray signs: 5 cases appeared as expanding destructive lesion, two of them were solitary cystic lesions, the others were multiple cystic lesions. Lytic destruction was showed in 2 cases. Sclerotic margin, calcification, soft tissue mass was visible in 5, 1 and 4 cases respectively. CT signs: 3 of 4 cases were expanding destructive lesions, including 2 multiple cystic lesions and 1 solitary cystic destruction. The other one showed lytic destruction. 3 had sclerotic margin; calcification was identified in 2 cases, 4 cases accompanied with soft tissue mass. MRI signs: All of 3 cases occurred at vertebrae, solitary cystic lesion in one and multiple cystic lesions in two. Lesions showed low signal on T1WI image, high signal on T2WI image and appeared as grape shapes. Involved vertebrae showed wedge-shaped. Conclusion(s): Imaging modalities were significantly valuable in the diagnosis of bone echinococcosis. Combination of X-ray radiography, CT, MRI and epidemiological information is helpful in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the bone echinococcosis.",Excluded
1396,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed. No other statistically significant differences were determined in the plasma p53 protein level between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed and not exposed to radon. These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
3081,"Six week evaluation of the potential for topical desoximetasone 0.25% spray to induce photoallergic skin reaction Purpose: Desoximetasone 0.25% topical spray is a novel formulation that has not been tested or approved for safety and efficacy. The primary objective was to determine the potential of desoximetasone 0.25 and 0.05% topical sprays, as well as a vehicle to induce photoallergic skin reaction after repeated topical application and irradiation to the skin using a controlled photopatch testing procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): 53 subjects completed the study, each with six application sites (two of each treatment), three of which were irradiated and three non-irradiated, for an induction period of three weeks and then challenge period at week 6. Result(s): Desoximetasone 0.25 and 0.05%, as well as vehicle showed no evidence of potential to induce photosensitization. There was statistically significantly greater irritation at the vehicle irradiated site in comparison to the irradiated treatment area of desoximetasone 0.25% (p =.005) and the irradiated treatment area of desoximetasone 0.05% (p =.008). Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that regular treatment with desoximetasone 0.25 and 0.05% spray, followed by UV light exposure does not induce photosensitization or photo-irritation. These findings increase confidence for the use of this topical spray in eczema or psoriasis patients who may also be receiving UV light therapy and may contribute to the clinical management of these patients.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
557,"[Influence of Professional Contact with Plutonium-239 on Indicators of the Immune Status of the Personnel at Siberian Chemical Plant] The results of the examination and monitoring of the personnel at the Siberian Chemical Plant (SChP) and adult population of Seversk are presented. The results of primary examination of the personnel who professionally contact the ionizing radiation (IR) from external sources and incorporated 239Pu showed that clinical symptoms of dysfunction of the immune system manifested themselves with a frequency of 75.30%. Infectious-inflammatory diseases (46.95%) and the combined pathology of infectious and allergic character (20.12%) were the most widespread. The allergic diseases (AD) without manifestations of an infectious component were observed not often (7.62%). The monitoring which was carried out for 10 years revealed a decrease in a percentage of persons with clinical signs of disorders of the immune system up to 60.68% among the personnel at the Chemical-Steel Plant and even more among the whole group of the studied personnel at SChP--49.68% (389 : 783). Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established. Similar dynamics of infectious and infectious and allergic syndromes is revealed when the activity of 239Pu is 40 nCi. AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included
3429,"Use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal cancer in Japan: analysis using a national database BACKGROUND: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) yields better outcomes and fewer toxicities for radiation therapy (RT) of head and neck cancers (HNCs), including nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). IMRT is the standard RT treatment and has been widely adopted in Western countries to treat HNCs. However, its uptake in clinical practice among NPC patients has never been studied., METHODS: We investigated the use of IMRT for NPC using data from a nationwide cancer registry to describe the use of IMRT among NPC patients in Japan. We analyzed the data of patients with HNC, including NPC, who underwent IMRT between 2012 and 2014, as recorded in the hospital-based cancer registries linked with insurance claims. We calculated the proportion of patients with NPC who underwent IMRT at each hospital. To evaluate the use of IMRT for NPC, the IMRT use for NPC was compared with the proportion of patients with prostate cancer who underwent IMRT., RESULTS: Among 508 patients with NPC who underwent RT at one of 87 hospitals, 348 (69%) underwent IMRT. This proportion gradually increased between 2012 and 2014 (62%, 64% and 77%). Meanwhile, 4790 patients with prostate cancer (90%) underwent IMRT. Although some hospitals where IMRT was performed treated many patients with NPC, the proportion of patients with NPC who were treated with IMRT was low., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT has not been widely adopted in Japan for treating NPC. Barriers for adopting its use should be identified to close the gap between the standard and actual medical practice in Japan. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

3423,"Time efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of new automated myocardial perfusion analysis software in 320-row CT cardiac imaging Objective: We aimed to evaluate the time efficiency and diagnostic accuracy of automated myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) image analysis software. Material(s) and Method(s): 320-row CTP was performed in 30 patients, and analyses were conducted independently by three different blinded readers by the use of two recent software releases (version 4.6 and novel version 4.71GR001, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis times were compared, and automated epi- and endocardial contour detection was subjectively rated in five categories (excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor). As semi-quantitative perfusion parameters, myocardial attenuation and transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) were calculated for each myocardial segment and agreement was tested by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Conventional coronary angiography served as reference standard. Result(s): The analysis time was significantly reduced with the novel automated software version as compared with the former release (Reader 1: 43:08 +/- 11:39 min vs. 09:47 +/- 04:51 min, Reader 2: 42:07 +/- 06:44 min vs. 09:42 +/- 02:50 min and Reader 3: 21:38 +/- 3:44 min vs. 07:34 +/- 02:12 min; p < 0.001 for all). Epi- and endocardial contour detection for the novel software was rated to be significantly better (p < 0.001) than with the former software. ICCs demonstrated strong agreement (>= 0.75) for myocardial attenuation in 93% and for TPR in 82%. Diagnostic accuracy for the two software versions was not significantly different (p = 0.169) as compared with conventional coronary angiography. Conclusion(s): The novel automated CTP analysis software offers enhanced time efficiency with an improvement by a factor of about four, while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded
1704,"Clinical and procedural characteristics associated with higher radiation exposure during percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary angiography BACKGROUND: We aim to study the clinical and procedural characteristics associated with higher radiation exposure in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and coronary angiography., METHODS AND RESULTS: Our present study included all coronary angiography and PCI procedures in 5 PCI centers in the Western part of Sweden, between January 1, 2008, and January 19, 2012. The radiation exposure and clinical data were collected prospectively in these 5 PCI centers in Sweden as part of the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR). A prediction model was made for the radiation exposure (dose-area product) expressed in Gy.cm(2). A total of 20 669 procedures were included in the present study, consisting of 9850 PCI and 10 819 coronary angiography procedures. In multivariable analyses, body mass index (beta=1.04; confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.04; P<0.001); history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (beta=1.32; CI, 1.28-1.32; P<0.001); 2, 3, or 4 treated lesions (2 treated lesions: beta=1.95; CI, 1.84-2.03; P<0.001; 3 treated lesions: beta=2.34; CI, 2.16-2.53; P<0.001; and 4 treated lesions: beta=2.83; CI, 2.53-3.16; P<0.001); and chronic total occlusion lesions (beta=1.39; CI, 1.31-1.48; P<0.001) were associated with the highest radiation exposure. After adjusting for procedural complexity, radial access route was not associated with increased radiation exposure (beta=1.00; CI, 0.98-1.03; P=0.67)., CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study population to assess radiation exposure, we found that high body mass index, history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, number of treated lesions, and chronic total occlusions were associated with the highest patient radiation exposure.

2217,"Estimation of long-term salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy A classification is proposed for estimating salivary gland damage induced by radiotherapy to the head and neck. The volume of salivary glands irradiated was evaluated, and their relative proportions of whole saliva output were calculated. Stimulated salivary flow rate was measured in 61 patients treated with radiotherapy for head and neck malignancies. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the classification of salivary gland damage and stimulated salivary flow rate. The volume of the major salivary glands irradiated seems to be the most important factor affecting the postirradiation salivary flow after a curative dose of radiotherapy. If possible, partial sparing of the salivary glands may help to keep the patient's salivary secretion at an acceptable level and promote protection against dental caries. Most patients irradiated to the head and neck, however, need an effective prophylactic programme for the rest of their lives in order to preserve their teeth.",Excluded
1581,"Needle placement for piriformis injection using 3-D imaging Piriformis syndrome is a pain syndrome originating in the buttock and is attributed to 6% - 8% of patients referred for the treatment of back and leg pain. The treatment for piriformis syndrome using fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), electromyography (EMG), and ultrasound (US) has become standard practice. The treatment of Piriformis Syndrome has evolved to include fluoroscopy and EMG with CT guidance. We present a case study of 5 successful piriformis injections using 3-D computer-assisted electromagnet needle tracking coupled with ultrasound. A 6-degree of freedom electromagnetic position tracker was attached to the ultrasound probe that allowed the system to detect the position and orientation of the probe in the magnetic field. The tracked ultrasound probe was used to find the posterior superior iliac spine. Subsequently, 3 points were captured to register the ultrasound image with the CT or magnetic resonance image scan. Moreover, after the registration was obtained, the navigation system visualized the tracked needle relative to the CT scan in real-time using 2 orthogonal multi-planar reconstructions centered at the tracked needle tip. Conversely, a recent study revealed that fluoroscopically guided injections had 30% accuracy compared to ultrasound guided injections, which tripled the accuracy percentage. This novel technique exhibited an accurate needle guidance injection precision of 98% while advancing to the piriformis muscle and avoiding the sciatic nerve. The mean (+/- SD) procedure time was 19.08 (+/- 4.9) minutes. This technique allows for electromagnetic instrument tip tracking with realtime 3-D guidance to the selected target. As with any new technique, a learning curve is expected; however, this technique could offer an alternative, minimizing radiation exposure.",Excluded
852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed 10 patients with hemangioma of the cavernous sinus who were treated with conventional radiotherapy between January 2000 and December 2016. The median patient age was 54 years (range, 31-65 years), and 8 patients (80.0%) were female. The mean hemangioma volume was 34.1 cm3 (range, 6.8-83.2 cm3), and fractionated radiation was administered to a total dose of 50-54 Gy with a daily dose of 2 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 6.8 years (range, 2.2-8.8 years). At last follow-up, the volume of the tumor had decreased in all patients. The average tumor volume reduction rate from the initial volume was 72.9% (range, 18.9-95.3%). All 10 of the cranial neuropathies observed before radiation therapy had improved, with complete symptomatic remission in 9 cases (90%) and partial remission in 1 case (10%). No new acute neurologic impairments were reported after radiotherapy. One probable compressive optic neuropathy was observed at 1 year after radiotherapy.

Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of DSA and kinetic image pairs were compared. Visual quality comparisons were also performed by specialists who used an online questionnaire. Interrater agreement was characterized by percent agreement and Fleiss k. Results A total of 1902 regions of interest were carefully selected in 110 image pairs to calculate and compare the SNRs. Median SNR in raw kinetic images was 3.3-fold and 2.3-fold higher than raw and postprocessed DSA images, respectively. A total of 232 pairs of raw and postprocessed kinetic images were compared. It was indicated that postprocessing improved the quality of kinetic images in 63.9% (2668 of 4176) of the comparisons. Interrater agreement was 75% and Fleiss k was 0.12 (P < .001). Also, 238 pairs of kinetic and DSA images were compared. Kinetic imaging was judged to have provided higher quality images than DSA in 69.0% (2462 of 3570) of the comparisons. The interrater agreement was 81% and Fleiss k was 0.17 (P < .001). Conclusion Kinetic imaging helps to view the same structures as digital subtraction angiography but offers better image quality. The improved signal-to-noise ratio suggests that this approach could reduce radiation exposure and improve the ability to view smaller vessels. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
3276,"Subacute and chronic benign superior vena cava obstructions: Endovascular treatment with self-expanding metallic stents OBJECTIVE. Our purpose is to report our clinical experience with patients who underwent endovascular treatment with Wallstents for subacute or chronic benign obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twelve patients who were an average of 54 +/- 12 years old were referred for treatment of severe SVC syndrome related to implanted central venous catheters (n = 8), postradiation fibrosis (n = 2), a permanent pacemaker (n = 1), or a benign tumor (n = 1). Symptoms were present for an average of 16 weeks (range, 4-48 weeks) before treatment. Diagnosis of SVC obstruction was confirmed with helical CT and pretherapeutic phlebography. Four patients had Stanford's type II stenosis; two, type III; and six, type IV. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up intervals were 11 months (range, 1-36 months) and 7 months (range, 1 week to 32 months), respectively. RESULTS. Recanalization was successful in all patients. Fifteen stents were implanted in the 12 patients. Stents were placed after percutaneous balloon angioplasty in nine patients, and primary stent placement was attempted in three patients. We immediately achieved a satisfactory SVC diameter in all patients, whose symptoms were relieved completely within 1 week of stent placement. No technical or clinical complications occurred. SVC syndrome recurred in one patient 2 months after stent placement and was treated by placing a second stent. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment with stent placement should be considered relevant and safe for refractory benign SVC syndrome. However, a larger series and a longer follow-up period are needed to define the role of stent placement for this syndrome.",Excluded
781,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included
2334,"Incidence and nature of tumors induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by gamma-irradiation In our previous studies carried out on inbred rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain (L. Gross and Y. Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 5910-5913, 1979), the tumor incidence was increased following irradiation (150 rads, 5 times, at weekly intervals), from 22 to 93% in females and from 5 to 59% in males. Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively. In the third group, among rats which received 4 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 17 of 19 females (89.4%) and 4 of 12 males (33.3%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.4 and 10.5 mo, respectively. The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included
795,"Baseline analysis of use of denosumab in osteoporotic patients: Indications, compliance, adverse effect and tolerability Background Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits osteoclast activity, reducing bone loss. In the UK, use of denosumab was approved by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from October 2010 (TA204) [1]. Denosumab was used in Rheumatology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London from October 2010. Objectives We audited the indications for use of denosumab in these patients. Drug compliance, adverse effect and tolerability of the drug were also analysed. Methods 81 patients (female 77, male 4, age range 52 to 92 years, mean age 72 years) who commenced denosumab between October 2010 and December 2011 were identified retrospectively. 97% (79/81) of the patients come from their own home and 3% (2/81) come from nursing home. Patients' demographics, risk factors, fracture history, bone mineral density (BMD), spine and hip T score and previous osteoporosis treatment were assessed. 58 patients had follow up data and renal function was monitored every six months. Side effects were documented. Results Pre-treatment Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was available on all patients (mean BMD spine and hip 0.686 gm/cm2 and 0.705 gm/cm2, mean T score spine and hip -3.025 and -1.776). 87% (75/81) had failed treatment with both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. 11% (9/81) had breast cancer and were on aromatase inhibitors. 16% (13/81) had mild renal impairment and 7% (6/81) had moderate renal impairment at the base line. 35.8% (29/81) of patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency at baseline and were treated. 9% (7/81) were on denosumab treatment for primary prevention of osteoporosis (T score range -2.3 to -4.1). All of these had failed oral medication previously. Four patients swapped from intravenous Ibandronate due to poor venous access. Use of denosumab was indicated clinically despite lack of specific risk factors suggested by NICE. All patients treated with denosumab for secondary prevention of osteoporosis (91%,74/81) met NICE criteria by virtue of previous fracture and failure of other treatments. Four men were treated off-license. 44% (36/81) had completed six month treatment and 27% (22/81) had completed one year treatment. All these patients were compliant to the drug. Conclusions Denosumab seems well tolerated and no serious side effect has been observed. Patients' renal function appears stable on treatment. Patients' compliance with denosumab is good.",Excluded
612,"Quantitative distribution of iodinated contrast media in body computed tomography: data from a large reference cohort Objectives: Dual-energy computed tomography allows for an accurate and reliable quantification of iodine. However, data on physiological distribution of iodine concentration (IC) is still sparse. This study aims to establish guidance for IC in abdominal organs and important anatomical landmarks using a large cohort of individuals without radiological tumor burden. Method(s): Five hundred seventy-one oncologic, portal venous phase dual-layer spectral detector CT studies of the chest and abdomen without tumor burden at time point of imaging confirmed by > 3-month follow-up were included. ROI were placed in parenchymatous organs (n = 25), lymph nodes (n = 6), and vessels (n = 3) with a minimum of two measurements per landmark. ROI were placed on conventional images and pasted to iodine maps to retrieve absolute IC. Normalization to the abdominal aorta was conducted to obtain iodine perfusion ratios. Bivariate regression analysis, t tests, and ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Absolute IC showed a broad scatter and varied with body mass index, between different age groups and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels (range 0.0 +/- 0.0 mg/ml-6.6 +/- 1.3 mg/ml). Unlike absolute IC, iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index; however, significant differences between the sexes and age groups persisted, showing a tendency towards decreased perfusion ratios in elderly patients (e.g., liver 18-44 years/>= 64 years: 0.50 +/- 0.11/0.43 +/- 0.10, p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): Distribution of IC obtained from a large-scale cohort is provided. As significant differences between sexes and age groups were found, this should be taken into account when obtaining quantitative iodine concentrations and applying iodine thresholds. Key Points: * Absolute iodine concentration showed a broad variation and differed between body mass index, age groups, and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels. * The iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index while significant differences between sexes and age groups persisted. * Provided guidance values may serve as reference when aiming to differentiate healthy and abnormal tissue based on iodine perfusion ratios.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
621,"Effects of exposure to a mobile phone on sexual behavior in adult male rabbit: an observational study The accumulating effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted by a conventional mobile phone (MP) on male sexual behaviour have not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we studied these effects in 18 male rabbits that were randomly divided into phone and control groups. Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.",Excluded
2526,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded
2469,"Stereotactic radiosurgery combined with nivolumab or Ipilimumab for patients with melanoma brain metastases: Evaluation of brain control and toxicity Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of concurrent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with untreated melanoma brain metastases. Patients and Methods: Eighty consecutive patients with 326 melanoma brain metastases receiving SRS in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab were identified from an institutional database and retrospectively evaluated. Patients started systemic treatment with intravenous nivolumab or ipilimumab within one week of receiving SRS. Nivolumab was given at doses of 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Ipilimumab was administered up to four doses of 10 mg/kg, one every 3 weeks, then patients had a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks, until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint of the study was intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were extracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), and neurological toxicity. Result(s): Eighty patients were analyzed. Forty-five patients received SRS and ipilimumab, and 35 patients received SRS and nivolumab. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the 6-month and 12-month intracranial PFS rates were 69% (95%CI,54-87%) and 42% (95%CI,24-65%) for patients receiving SRS and nivolumab and 48% (95%CI,34-64%) and 17% (95%CI,5-31%) for those treated with SRS and ipilimumab (p = 0.02), respectively. Extracranial PFS and OS were 37 and 78% in SRS and nivolumab group, respectively, and 17 and 68% in SRS and ipilimumab group, respectively, at 12 months. Sub-group analysis showed significantly better intracranial PFS for patients receiving multi-fraction SRS (3 x 9 Gy) compared to single-fraction SRS (70% versus 46% at 6 months, p = 0.01), especially in combination with nivolumab. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 (24%) patients treated with SRS and ipilimumab and 6 (17%) patients who received SRS and nivolumab. Radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) occurred in 15% of patients. Conclusion(s): Concurrent SRS and ipilimumab or nivolumab show meaningful intracranial activity in patients with either asymptomatic and symptomatic melanoma brain metastases, although a subset of patients may develop symptomatic RN. The combination of nivolumab with SRS is associated with better intracranial control.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
3120,"Health status of Greek thyroid cancer patients after radioiodine administration compared to a demographically matched general population sample The impact of radioiodine-131 (131I) treatment on thyroid cancer patients' quality of life is controversial. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 60 patients aged 18-73 years old who had recently underwent near total thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid cancer and were scheduled for 131I treatment. On admission to our department, prior to 131I administration patients underwent clinical and laboratory investigation including routine clinical biochemistry, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was estimated by the SF- 36 Health Survey a generic instrument which consisted from eight scales (four for physical and four for mental health). After 131I administration patients were discharged and approximately 6 months later they were re-evaluated. Our results showed that HRQoL in thyroid cancer patients receiving 131I treatment is independent of age/ gender and thyroid cancer-related variables. All SF-36 scales significantly improved six months after administration (P<0.05). Compared to Greek general population, before 131I administration all scales were significantly lower (P<0.05). Six months post 131I administration, scales were significantly lower for physical functioning (P=0.02), physical role (P=0.01), social functioning (P=0.03) and emotional role limitations (P=0.04), whereas the remaining SF-36 scales were comparable to the general population. In conclusion, hypothyroidism and anxiety for the outcome of their disease before 131I treatment exert a negative impact on thyroid cancer patients. Quality of life improvement post 131I is mainly attributed to the resumption of euthyroidism and familiarization with treatment and follow-up procedures rather than 131I treatment itself. There was no significant difference between patients receiving lower (2220-3700MBq) and higher (3700-7400MBq) dosage.",Excluded
1014,"Rationale and design of the NO-PARTY trial: Near-zero fluoroscopic exposure during catheter ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias in young patients Introduction Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the mainstay of therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Conventional radiofrequency catheter ablation requires the use of fluoroscopy, thus exposing patients to ionising radiation. The feasibility and safety of non-fluoroscopic radiofrequency catheter ablation has been recently reported in a wide range of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias using the EnSite NavXTM mapping system. The NO-PARTY is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system results in a clinically significant reduction in exposure to ionising radiation compared with conventional catheter ablation. Methods The study will randomise 210 patients undergoing catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias to either a conventional ablation technique or one guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system. The primary end-point is the reduction of the radiation dose to the patient. Secondary end-points include procedural success, reduction of the radiation dose to the operator, and a cost-effectiveness analysis. In a subgroup of patients, we will also evaluate the radiobiological effectiveness of dose reduction by assessing acute chromosomal DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Conclusions NO-PARTY will determine whether radiofrequency catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system is a suitable and cost-effective approach to achieve a clinically significant reduction in ionising radiation exposure for both patient and operator. © Copyright 2012 Cambridge University Press.",Excluded
615,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice. Routine radiographs most specifically document mature ossifications.",Excluded

2710,"Low dose radiotherapy is associated with local complications but not disease control in sacral chordoma BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications.

2651,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included
2940,"Early body weight loss during concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer Background and purpose: Radiation-esophagitis and weight loss are frequently observed toxicities in patients treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CT-RT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and might be related. The purpose was to investigate whether weight loss already starts early after initiation of CT-RT and precedes radiation-esophagitis. Material(s) and Method(s): In a retrospective cohort, weight and esophagitis grade >=2 were assessed during the first weeks of (CT-)RT in patients treated with concurrent (n = 102) or sequential (n = 92) therapy. In a prospective validation study, data on body weight, esophagitis grade >=2, nutritional intake and muscle strength were obtained before, during and following CT-RT. Result(s): In the retrospective cohort, early weight loss was observed in concurrently treated patients (p = 0.002), independent of esophagitis >= grade 2. Early weight loss was also observed in the prospective cohort (p = 0.003) and was not accompanied by decreases in nutritional intake. In addition lower limb muscle strength rapidly declined (p = 0.042). In the later weeks of treatment, further body weight loss occurred (p < 0.001) despite increased nutritional supplementation and body weight was only partly recovered after 4 weeks post CT-RT (p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): Weight loss during concurrent CT-RT for NSCLC starts early and prior to onset of esophagitis, requiring timely and intense nutritional rehabilitation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2535,"Treatment of recurrent bronchial carcinoma: the role of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy PURPOSE: This study's aim was to assess outcome and toxicity of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy (HDREB) for recurrent bronchial carcinoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1987 to 2005, 41 patients were treated with HDREB for symptomatic recurrent bronchial carcinoma. All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >or=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >or=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects., CONCLUSIONS: Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications.

2151,"Radiosurgery for the treatment of spinal melanoma metastases BACKGROUND: The role of stereotactic radiosurgery in treating metastatic melanoma involving the spine has previously been limited. Conventional external beam radiotherapy lacks the precision to allow delivery of large single-fraction doses of radiation and simultaneously to limit the dose delivered to radiosensitive structures such as the spinal cord. This study evaluated the clinical efficacy of radiosurgery for the treatment of melanoma spinal metastases in 28 patients., METHODS: Thirty-six melanoma spine metastases were treated with a single-session radiosurgery technique (1 cervical, 11 thoracic, 13 lumbar, and 11 sacral) with a follow-up period of 3-43 months (median 13 months). Tumor volume ranged from 4.1 to 153 cm3 (mean 47.6 cm3). Twenty-three of the 36 lesions had received prior external beam irradiation., RESULTS: Maximum tumor dose was maintained at 17.5-25 Gy (mean 21.7 Gy). Spinal cord volume receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 0.7 cm3 (mean 0.26 cm3); spinal canal volume at the cauda equina level receiving > 8 Gy ranged from 0.0 to 3.5 cm3 (mean 0.98 cm3). No radiation-induced toxicity occurred during the follow-up period. Axial and radicular pain improved in 27 of 28 patients (96%) who were treated primarily for pain. Long-term tumor control was seen in 3 of 4 cases treated primarily for radiographic tumor progression. Two patients went on to require open surgical intervention for tumor progression resulting in neurological deficit., CONCLUSIONS: Spinal radiosurgery offers a therapeutic modality for the safe delivery of large dose fractions of radiation therapy in a single fraction for the management of spinal metastases in patients with advanced melanoma that are often poorly controlled with alternative conventional external beam radiation therapy, and is successful even in patients with previously irradiated lesions.

The three cyst populations experimented could be differentiated according to their development and survival rates. The variations observed for both of these criteria were related to the age of the cysts and the selection technique. The study of radiosensitivity based on LD50 value showed that the highest radiosensitivity differences were related to the cyst selection technique and not to the age. Furthermore, the three cyst populations showed that radio-induced lethal effects were enhanced, or appeared with time, namely following the delay between irradiation and the cyst development study. The observation of late effects after irradiations or after space flights show the difficulties encountered in assessing radiative risks during long duration space flights.",Excluded
2436,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

360,"Factors associated with presence and extent of coronary calcium in those predicted to be at low risk according to Framingham risk score (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Even among asymptomatic persons at low risk (<10%) according to the Framingham risk score, high coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores signify a greater predicted risk of coronary heart disease events. We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

819,"Role of aortic calcification, stiffness and wave reflections in cardiovascular risk in dialysis patients: Baseline data from the CORD study Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Method(s): Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Result(s): Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.",Excluded
990,"Decrease of respiratory burst in neutrophils of patients with ankylosing spondylitis by combined radon-hyperthermia treatment OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils, the total anti-oxidative status of plasma, and the parameters of systemic inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) before and after a combined radon-hyperthermia treatment in the thermal tunnels of Bockstein-Bad Gastein in Austria., METHODS: In 20 patients with AS the effects of a total of 15 hours of radon-hyperthermia-treatment spread over a period of three weeks were studied. The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included
1263,"The Henri Mondor Procedure of Morbidity and Mortality Review Meetings: Prospective Registration of Clinical, Dosimetric, and Individual Radiosensitivity Data of Patients With Severe Radiation Toxicity PURPOSE: After radiation therapy (RT), various radiation-induced toxicities can develop in about one-fourth of patients. An international interest in using morbidity and mortality rates to monitor the quality of care and integrate morbidity and mortality review (MMR) meetings into organizations' governance processes has arisen. We report the first results of patients included in our MMR procedure that included biological assays for individual intrinsic radiosensitivity (IIRS)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-three patients were prospectively included in the MMR database. Twenty-two were evaluable for IIRS. Prostate (n=10) and breast (n=8) cancers were the most frequent disease types. The total dose delivered, determined according to the type of disease, ranged from 30 to 74 Gy. Our MMR procedure requires strict criteria: patients with unresolved toxicity of grade 3 or higher with availability of clinical (photographic) data, IIRS results obtained from skin biopsy assays, treatment modalities, and follow-up data. The RT technique and dosimetry were reviewed., RESULTS: Our prospective registration of toxicities showed mainly rectitis, occurring in 7 cases, and skin toxicities, occurring in 9. Of the 7 patients with rectitis, 5 received 66 Gy of post-prostatectomy RT with V50 (rectum volume receiving 50 Gy) ranging from 45% to 75% and a mean maximal dose of 66.5 Gy. For dermatitis and cystitis, the mean maximal doses were in the range of classical constraints without any overdosage or dose heterogeneity. No errors were found in the review of treatment planning and positioning. Conversely, all the patients were considered biologically as radiosensitive with genomic instability and ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated)-dependent DNA double-strand break repair impairments., CONCLUSIONS: The MMR review of files allowed clear answers for patients on the relationship between clinical events and their IIRS. Our procedure has allowed education of all our staff to monitor, identify, and document clinical, physical, and biological aspects of radiation-induced toxicities. Thus we recommend the introduction of the MMR procedure in RT departments. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
314,"Mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea, 1996-2015 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea., METHODS: The study population included all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the National Dosimetry Registry (NDR) between 1996 and 2011. NDR data were linked with mortality data obtained from national registries through 2015. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative standardised mortality ratios (rSMRs) were calculated for external comparison and for adjustment of the cohort's overall healthiness., RESULTS: A total of 1099 deaths (974 in men and 125 in women) were reported from among 80 837 medical radiation workers. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population. However, occupational factors may have been involved in the increased relative mortality for several causes of death. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use.

618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones. These results suggest probable involvement of I-J-bearing suppressor T-cells in the hematopoietic disorders induced by pertussis vaccine.,Excluded
3240,"Imaging for appendicitis: should radiation-induced cancer risks affect modality selection? PURPOSE: To compare life expectancy (LE) losses attributable to three imaging strategies for appendicitis in adults-computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) followed by CT for negative or indeterminate US results, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-by using a decision-analytic model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this model, for each imaging strategy, LE losses for 20-, 40-, and 65-year-old men and women were computed as a function of five key variables: baseline cohort LE, test performance, surgical mortality, risk of death from delayed diagnosis (missed appendicitis), and LE loss attributable to radiation-induced cancer death. Appendicitis prevalence, test performance, mortality rates from surgery and missed appendicitis, and radiation doses from CT were elicited from the published literature and institutional data. LE loss attributable to radiation exposure was projected by using a separate organ-specific model that accounted for anatomic coverage during a typical abdominopelvic CT examination. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate effects of model input variability on results., RESULTS: Outcomes across imaging strategies differed minimally-for example, for 20-year-old men, corresponding LE losses were 5.8 days (MR imaging), 6.8 days (combined US and CT), and 8.2 days (CT). This order was sensitive to differences in test performance but was insensitive to variation in radiation-induced cancer deaths. For example, in the same cohort, MR imaging sensitivity had to be 91% at minimum (if specificity were 100%), and MR imaging specificity had to be 62% at minimum (if sensitivity were 100%) to incur the least LE loss. Conversely, LE loss attributable to radiation exposure would need to decrease by 74-fold for combined US and CT, instead of MR imaging, to incur the least LE loss., CONCLUSION: The specific imaging strategy used to diagnose appendicitis minimally affects outcomes. Paradigm shifts to MR imaging owing to concerns over radiation should be considered only if MR imaging test performance is very high.",Excluded
2571,"""Target-lesion"" SYNTAX score (tSS) determines radiation dose in percutaneous coronary intervention OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between ""target-lesion"" SYNTAX score (tSS) and radiation dose (RD) and examine the predictive value of tSS and other variables on RD from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., BACKGROUND: The complexity of PCI influences procedural RD. The novel tSS was utilized to quantify targeted-PCI complexity., METHODS: We studied 420 consecutive patients who had PCI in our hospital. Two investigators independently measured tSS using the SYNTAX scoring algorithm. Patients were divided into three BMI (kg/m(2) ) subgroups: <25 (normal), 25-30 (overweight), and >30 (obese); and tSS tertiles: <5.5 (simple), 5.5-9 (moderate), and >9 (complex)., RESULTS: Obese patients were significantly younger and likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM). tSS positively correlated with RD for both genders, with median RD significantly higher in males (P < 0.0001). tSS correlated with RD in all three BMI subgroups (all P < 0.0001). Multivariate linear regression showed RD can be predicted by the formula: RD = -898 + 18 tSS + 49 BMI + 142 DM + 207 male., CONCLUSIONS: We report that tSS is a quantitative index of ""target-lesion"" PCI complexity, which is easy to measure with good reproducibility. tSS significantly and independently correlates with RD, although the strength of the association is less than for other predictors of RD (gender, diabetes, and BMI). tSS may be used to determine the RD from PCI and enhance patient risk-stratification when formulating a PCI strategy.

2839,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells. Our findings indicate that the NKG2D haplotypes are associated with the expression levels of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells, resulting in inter-individual variations in human cytotoxic response. © 2012 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.",Included
1152,"Damage-induced apoptosis in primary human lymphocytes is a genetic program modified by gender and age Apoptosis is a core pathway deregulated in hematologic and other cancers. Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males. Genetic models to explain this will be discussed.",Included

The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the performance of standard-dose MDCT with that of low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation in patients with renal colic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Three hundred patients underwent 6- and 16-MDCT in 150 standard-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 95 mAs at 130 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 120 mAs at 120 kV) and 150 low-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 51 mAs at 110 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 70 mAs at 120 kV), all performed with 4D tube current modulation. Two experienced radiologists using a clinical workstation and blinded to scan parameters prospectively viewed the images from the 300 examinations. In a second session, one experienced radiologist and two first-year residents using a clinical workstation retrospectively reviewed images from 100 randomly selected standard-dose and 100 randomly selected low-dose examinations. RESULTS. Tube current modulation reduced effective tube current 25-31% in all examinations. Mean effective dose was 1.41-1.58 mSv for low-dose examinations, which reached additional dose reduction of 51.2-64.3% in comparison with standard-dose examinations. Excellent correlation existed between mean tube current and body mass index of the patients. Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.85-0.88 for all examinations. The sensitivity of low-dose examinations interpreted by two experienced reviewers was 97.3-98.6%; specificity, 93.5%; and accuracy, 95.3%. These findings were comparable with those for standard-dose examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of low-dose examinations of overweight and obese patients reached similar high values: 97-100%, 100%, and 98-100%, respectively. Interobserver agreement for urinary stone detection was excellent between the two reviewers, with kappa values of 0.98 for the low-dose and 0.96 for the standard-dose examinations. An alternative diagnosis was identified in 15% and 16% of cases by two experienced radiologists in the two examinations groups. In the second interpretation session, the residents found an alternative diagnosis in only 10-12% of standard-dose examinations and only 4-5% of low-dose examinations. CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation can be used as standard procedure in evaluation for urolithiasis, even in overweight and obese patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2798,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures. However, a definite conclusion can only be drawn on replication by different studies among individuals who are highly exposed to IR.",Included

For patients without an apparent cause (eg, recent head, neck, or cardiothoracic surgery or known malignancy), CT head/neck and chest was performed to evaluate the recurrent laryngeal nerve course. Data included demographics, symptoms, radiography, and interventions. Statistical analyses were performed via chi(2) analysis., RESULTS: Of 406 patients with VFMI, 47 (11%) patients had no apparent cause clinically. Routine CT revealed abnormalities in 10 (21%) patients, of which only 3 (6%) could account for VFMI: benign thyroid adenoma (1), papillary thyroid cancer (1), and an esophageal mass (1). The most common lesion detected involved the thyroid. Demographic data and symptom type were not significantly associated with detection of a VFMI-attributable lesion on CT. Overall, routine CT did not identify a focal etiology in 94% patients with VFMI without an apparent cause., CONCLUSION: Routine pan-CT evaluation failed to reveal an etiology in 94% of patients with VFMI without an apparent cause.

2931,"Utility of dual-energy CT for predicting the vascularity of meningiomas PURPOSE: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) can provide iodine, electron density (ED), and effective atomic number Z (Zeff) maps, facilitating the identification of tissue types. We investigated whether DECT parameters can predict the vascularity of meningiomas., METHOD: We acquired DECT and perfusion CT (PCT) images in 24 patients with histologically diagnosed meningioma. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed at the tumor in iodine, ED, and Zeff maps derived from DECT and in a blood volume (BV) map derived from PCT. To normalize these parameters' values, we divided them by the values of contralateral normal-appearing white matter, i.e., the relative (r)ED, rZeff, and rBV. The vascular density of the tumor specimens was immunohistochemically analyzed by calculating the von Willebrand factor-positive vessel wall. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients to determine the correlation with PCT/DECT parameters and an immunohistopathological index., RESULTS: Contrast rZeff (r = 0.7020, p = 0.0001) and iodine (r = 0.5814, p = 0.0029) both had positive correlations with rBV derived from PCT. The rED values were negatively correlated with the rBV values (r = -0.4735, p = 0.0194), and the vascular density results confirmed positive correlations with rBV (r = 0.6909, p = 0.0002) and contrast rZeff (r = 0.4982, p = 0.0132) and a negative correlation with rED (r = -0.4265, p = 0.0377). Regarding the radiation exposure, the mean estimated volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) of DECT was 33.1 +/- 1.72 mGy, much lower than that of PCT (103.3 +/- 4.65 mGy)., CONCLUSIONS: DECT predicted vascular density with lower radiation exposure compared to PCT.

3411,"Magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal neoplasms MRI has been shown to be very useful in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. The lack of ionizing radiation, the superb contrast resolution, and the ability to directly scan the sagittal and coronal planes make MRI a very attractive imaging mode for treatment planning. With spin-echo MRI, maximum contrast between tumor and fatty tissues generally occurs with short TR and TE times (T1-weighted images). Likewise, maximum contrast between tumor and muscle, tendon, or ligaments occurs with long values of TR and TE (T2-weighted images). Early experience suggests that the already exceptional contrast resolution seen with MRI can be improved even more with the administration of intravenous contrast agents. Just as with CT, fatty tumors can usually be easily distinguished from other tissue types with MRI by means of their differential intensity behavior at different pulse sequences. Fluid-filled tumors, such as unicameral bone cysts or aneurysmal bone cysts may be suspected in the same manner, especially if a fluid-fluid level is seen within the lesion. Otherwise, MRI has not been useful so far in noninvasively determining the histologic type of tumors. Our experience and that of others suggests that MRI is equal or superior to CT in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. This is especially striking when it is remembered that one is comparing an immature MRI technology with a mature CT technology. Although CT presently has a central role in the staging of musculoskeletal tumors, MRI will shortly supplant it in many cases.",Excluded
1635,"Hyperparathyroidism after thyroid surgery and autotransplantation of histologically normal parathyroid glands BACKGROUND: Parathyroid autotransplantation is a well-established method to prevent hypoparathyroidism during parathyroid and thyroid operations. The reported success rate of parathyroid autotransplantation ranges from 75% to 100%. Recurrent hyperparathyroidism may develop after parathyroid autotransplantation, especially after the transplantation of hyperplastic or adenomatous parathyroid tissue. Hyperparathyroidism recurs most frequently after subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy and autotransplantation, in patients with renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism, and in patients with familial primary hyperparathyroidism or MEN I or MEN II syndrome. We report three patients who experienced primary hyperparathyroidism after autotransplantation of normal parathyroid tissue during thyroid operations (two patients) or after a long period of hypoparathyroidism., STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed our records from 1983 to May 1998 and identified three patients in whom hyperparathyroidism developed after thyroid operations., RESULTS: One patient had a thyroidectomy with left modified radical neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancer, followed by radioiodine ablative therapy. Two patients had thyroid operations for benign thyroid disease.

1170,"To Compare the therapeutic efficacy and safety of fexofenadine with chlorpheniramine and betamethasone (oral) in the treatment of allergic rhinitis Aim and Objectives: To compare then therapeutic efficacy and safety of Fexofenadine with Chlorpheneramine maleate and Betamethasone short course therapy given orally (which are still the most commonly used drugs in government hospitals) in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. To compare the effects of Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone on eosinophil count and IgE levels. To compare the cost effectiveness of the Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone in the treatment of Allergic Rhinitis. Material(s) and Method(s): A prospective study was done over a period of 1 month (20th July 2012 to 20th August 2012) over 75 people aged between 15 to 45 years including males and females at Warangal. They were divided into 3 groups. Group I (n: 25) used Fexofenadine 120 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group II (n: 25) used CPM 4 mg, O.D., for 14 days. Group III (n: 25) used Betametasone 0.5 mg, B.D., for 7 days. Presenting complaints with duration, personal history of exposure to any allergens, family history of any allergies, general examination of the patient, ENT examination, Investigations: CBP with DLC, Absolute eosinophil count, X-Ray of paranasal sinuses, Skin test for allergy, IgE levels in the serum. Result(s): The three drugs Fexofenadine, Chlorpheneramine and Betametasone were found to have similar levels of efficacy in controlling the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. The physical signs improved better with Chlorpheneramine than the other two drugs. Fexofenadine was found to be most effective in suppression of skin reactions to the allergens. It was closely followed by Betametasone and then Chlorpheneramine. The anti-histamine, Fexofenadine and Chlorpheneramine had no significant effect on the absolute eosinophil count and serum IgE levels whereas Betametasone had significant effect. The Cost burden is extremely low on patients using CPM followed by betamethasone than n fexofenadine. Conclusion(s): According to the results Fexofenadine, CPM Betamethasone have almost equally therapeutic efficacy. Betamethasone cannot be given for very long time because of its wide range of side effects. In rural place like Warangal(KMC) where people can't effort money for treatment, CPM is the better drugbecause it has equal therapeutic efficacy and cost burden is very less compared to othersit is at an affordableprice.",Excluded

Diagnostic scans were performed with 111 MBq of (123)I-MIBG. Therapeutic doses of (131)I-MIBG (5.55-7.40 GBq) were administrated and whole-body scans were obtained at 2-5 days after (131)I-MIBG administrations. We compared the number of lesions and the lesion-to-referent count ratios at 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and at 2-5 days of (131)I-MIBG., RESULTS: In comparison with the 6-h images of (123)I-MIBG, the 24-h images of (123)I-MIBG could detect more lesions in eight patients. Posttreatment (131)I-MIBG scans revealed new lesions in eight patients compared with the 24-h images of (123)I-MIBG. The lesion-to-referent count ratios at 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and at 3 days of (131)I-MIBG were increasing at later scanning time. There were significant differences in the lesion-to-referent count ratios between 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG (P = 0.031), 6 h of (123)I-MIBG and 3 days of (131)I-MIBG (P = 0.020), and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and 3 days of (131)I-MIBG (P = 0.018)., CONCLUSION: Low-dose diagnostic (123)I-MIBG whole-body scan is inferior to posttreatment (131)I-MIBG whole-body scan in malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Considering the scan timing of (123)I-MIBG, 6-h images might have no superiority compared with 24-h images.",Excluded
1017,"A comparison of in vivo cellular responses to CS-137 gamma rays and 320-KV X rays Research reported here relates to comparing the relative effectiveness of 320-kV X rays compared to Cs-137 gamma rays for two in vivo endpoints in C.B-17 mice after whole-body exposure: (1) cytotoxicity to bone marrow cells and splenocytes evaluated at 24-hours post exposure and (2) bone marrow and spleen reconstitution deficits (repopulation shortfalls) evaluated at 6 weeks post exposure. We show that cytotoxicity dose-response relationships for bone marrow cells and splenocytes are complex, involving negative curvature (decreasing slope as dose increases), presumably implicating a mixed cell population comprised of large numbers of hypersensitive, modestly radiosensitive, and resistant cells. The radiosensitive cells appear to respond with 50% being killed by a dose < 0.5 Gy. The X-ray relative biological effectiveness (RBE), relative to gamma rays, for destroying bone marrow cells in vivo is > 1, while for destroying splenocytes it is < 1. In contrast, dose-response relationships for reconstitution deficits in the bone marrow and spleen of C.B-17 mice at 6 weeks after radiation exposure were of the threshold type with gamma rays being more effective in causing reconstitution deficit. © 2013 University of Massachusetts.",Excluded
2109,"Calcium imaging and selective computed tomography angiography in comparison to functional testing for suspected coronary artery disease: the multicentre, randomized CRESCENT trial AIMS: To compare the effectiveness and safety of a cardiac computed tomography (CT) algorithm with functional testing in patients with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD)., METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 2011 and July 2013, 350 patients with stable angina, referred to the outpatient clinic of four Dutch hospitals, were prospectively randomized between cardiac CT and functional testing (2 : 1 ratio). The tiered cardiac CT protocol included a calcium scan followed by CT angiography if the Agatston calcium score was between 1 and 400. Patients with test-specific contraindications were not excluded from study participation. By 1 year, fewer patients randomized to cardiac CT reported anginal complaints (P = 0.012). The cumulative radiation dose was slightly higher in the CT group (6.6 +/- 8.7 vs. 6.1 +/- 9.3 mSv; P < 0.0001). After 1.2 years, event-free survival was 96.7% for patients randomized to CT and 89.8% for patients randomized to functional testing (P = 0.011). After CT, the final diagnosis was established sooner (P < 0.0001), and additional downstream testing was required less frequently (25 vs. 53%, P < 0.0001), resulting in lower cumulative diagnostic costs (369 vs. 440; P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: For patients with suspected stable CAD, a tiered cardiac CT protocol offers an effective and safe alternative to functional testing. Incorporating the calcium scan into the diagnostic workup was safe and lowered diagnostic expenses and radiation exposure. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

2673,"Diagnostic accuracy of 1.5-t unenhanced whole-heart coronary MR Angiography Performed with 32-Channel Cardiac Coils: Initial single-center experience Purpose: To compare the imaging time and image quality obtained with whole-heart coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and determine the accuracy of MR angiography performed with 32-channel coils in the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials andMethods: The institutional review board approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. The authors studied 10 healthy subjects and 67 patients suspected of having CAD who were scheduled for coronary angiography. Unenhanced 1.5-T coronary MR angiography was performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and with 32-channel coils in patients. Clinicallysignifi cant CAD was defi ned as a diameter reduction of at least 50% at coronary angiography. The sensitivity and specifi city of coronary MR angiography were calculated. Result(s): The mean imaging time was substantially reduced from 2.3 minutes 6 4.2 (standard deviation) with fi ve-channel coils to 6.3 minutes 6 2.2 with 32-channel coils, with equivalent image quality scores. Acquisition of MR angiograms was completed in all 67 patients, with a mean imaging time of 6.2 minutes 6 2.8. The prevalence of CAD in he study population was 58% (39 of the 67 patients). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves determined at vessel- and patient-based analyses were 0.91 and 0.90, respectively; the sensitivity and specifi city at vessel-based analysis were 86% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Whole-heart coronary MR angiography performed at 1.5 T with 32-channel coils permits noninvasive detection of CAD with substantially reduced imaging time. This noninvasive approach can be an alternative to multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography for ruling out obstructive CAD in patients who have a contraindication to contrast material and in young subjects who are at higher risk from ionizing radiation. © RSNA, 2011.",Excluded
1542,"Cephalad dislocation of PICCs under different upper limb positions: influence of age, gender, BMI, number of lumens Purpose: To evaluate parameters that influence the amount of movement of peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) tips regarding upper limb movement. Method(s): In a prospective 12-month observational study, 200 PICCs were implanted in 162 patients (mean age 56.8 +/- 15.2 years) by interventional radiologists into the basilic vein of the mid-aspect of the upper arm. Three PICC tip positions were documented with a chest x-ray: patient supine with an abducted (90degree), an adducted arm, and in an upright position with an adducted arm. Multivariable analyses were performed, based on the three positions: body mass index (BMI), number of lumens, age, gender, side of the implantation, and brand. Result(s): Up to 88% of the PICCs dislocated in a mean of 19 mm cephalad when the patient was positioned from a supine in an upright position. The greatest influence upon dislocation was the position change from supine to upright. The side of the implanted PICC (left vs. right) had no influence. Conclusion(s): Cephalad dislocations of mean 19 mm regularly occur in the upright position induced by gravity. This needs to be taken in account and the PICC should be safely positioned one vertebra lower in the superior vena cava superior with a last confirmation of the PICC placement in an upright position.Copyright © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded

Result(s): Significant HRA changes by Porta and Guzik indices were not found on exposure compared to sham exposure. Time-domain HRV parameters on exposure showed significant differences at 1:1 paced, but not at 1:2 paced breathing compared to sham exposure. A mild post-exposure effect was observed regarding root mean square of successive RR-differences. Conclusion(s): The findings reflect persisting acute effects of GSM handset emission on the autonomic nervous system. Exploring its influences on health status and survival needs further studies.

2568,"Feasibility and potential utility of multicomponent exhaled breath analysis for predicting development of radiation pneumonitis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy INTRODUCTION: In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential utility of measuring multiple exhaled gases as biomarkers of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung tumors., METHODS: Breath analysis was performed for 26 patients receiving SABR for lung tumors. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO), nitrous oxide (eN2O), and carbon dioxide (eCO2) were measured before and immediately after each fraction using real-time, infrared laser spectroscopy. RP development (CTCAE grade >=2) was correlated with baseline gas concentrations, acute changes in gas concentrations after each SABR fraction, and dosimetric parameters., RESULTS: Exhaled breath analysis was successfully completed in 77% of patients. Five of 20 evaluable patients developed RP at a mean of 5.4 months after SABR. Acute changes in eNO and eCO concentrations, defined as percent changes between each pre-fraction and post-fraction measurement, were significantly smaller in RP versus non-RP cases (p = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, a combined predictor of baseline eNO greater than 24 parts per billion and acute decrease in eCO less than 5.5% strongly correlated with RP incidence (p =0.0099). Neither eN2O nor eCO2 concentrations were significantly associated with RP development. Although generally higher in patients destined to develop RP, dosimetric parameters were not significantly associated with RP development., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SABR patients in this pilot study were able to complete exhaled breath analysis. Baseline concentrations and acute changes in concentrations of exhaled breath components were associated with RP development after SABR. If our findings are validated, exhaled breath analysis may become a useful approach for noninvasive identification of patients at highest risk for developing RP after SABR.",Excluded
2241,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA. LOH was strongly associated with sarcoma but not with treatment. The results do not support the hypothesis that IMRT increases the risk of second cancer. Thus the current practice of withholding dose-sparing IMRT from young patients may need to be re-evaluated.",Included

Most post-radiotherapy NPC patients experience oropharyngeal dysphagia that results in pharyngeal residue. Pharyngeal residue is thought to be a risk factor for aspiration-penetration. Objective(s): Examining the correlation between pharyngeal residue and penetration-aspiration in postradiotherapy NPC patients. Method(s): Participants have been identified since 2018 to find out the total number of NPC patients. In the period January-October 2019, identification of NPC patients was performed according to participant criteria. Participants were examined for fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), pharyngeal residue using the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPR-SRS), and penetration-aspiration using Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). Statistical tests were used Spearman correlation test with p<0.05. Result(s): The highest participant's pharyngeal residue appeared in vallecula when given soft bolus (96.55%), and in pyriform sinus when given thick liquid bolus (72.41%). Most participants with soft bolus had the highest negative penetration (72.59%) and positive penetration in thick liquid bolus (51.72%), while most had negative aspirations with the lowest value (89.66%). There is aspiration in 10.34% of patients when given a dilute liquid.

1,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

1161,"A review of the effects of uranium and depleted uranium exposure on reproduction and fetal development Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating munitions, military vehicle armor, and aircraft, ship and missile counterweighting/ballasting, as well as in a number of other military and commercial applications. Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded

1266,"Comparison of three dosimetric techniques to take in account lung tumor motion: Gating-like technique results lead to advice the use of gating device even in the cases of pre-operative irradiation Purpose: Comparison of three dosimetric techniques of lung tumor delineation to integrate tumor motion during breathing. Patients and Methods: Nineteen patients with T1-3N0M0 malignant lung tumor were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (14 cases) or pre-surgery chemoradiation. Doses were, respectively, 66 and 46 Gy. CT-scan for delineation was performed during three phases of breathing: free breathing and deep breath-hold inspiration and expiration. GTV (gross tumor volume) was delineated on the three sequences. The classic technique included GTV from the free-breathing sequence plus a CTV (clinical target volume) margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV (planning target volume) margin of 7 to 10 mm (including ITV [internal target volume] margin and set-up margin). The gating-like technique included GTV from the deep breath-hold inspiration sequence plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. The three-volume technique, included GTV as a result of the fusion of GTVs from the three sequences plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8 mm plus a PTV margin of 2 mm. Dosimetry was calculated for the three PTVs, if possible, with the same fields number and position. Dose constraints and rules were imposed to accept dosimetries: firstly spinal cord maximal dose less than 45 Gy, followed by V95 % for PTV greater than or equal to 95 %, and V20 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 30 %, V30 GYGy for lung less than or equal to 20 %. Result(s): GTVs were not statistically different between the three methods of delineation. PTVs were significantly lower with the gating-like technique. V95% of the PTV were not different between the three techniques. With the classic-, the gating-like- and the 3-volume techniques, dosimetry was considered as acceptable, respectively in 15, 18 and 15 cases. Comparisons of constraint values showed that the gating-like method gave the best results. In the case of pre-operative management, the gating-like method allowed the best results even for the V95% values. However, in the absence of gating device or without the possibility to use it, the 3-volume method allowed to take into account more precisely the organ motion than the classical technique. Conclusion(s): The 3-volume method can be done. It is a good method to take into account the organ motions. However, the gating-like method gives the best results leading to propose its use even for pre-operative patients with upper tumors. © 2009.",Excluded

However, it has been recently emphasized that AF ablation in patients with HF is associated with increased risks of procedure-related complications and mortality. There are little data about the differences in the efficacy and safety between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF in patients with HF. Method(s): The CRABL-HF study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of AF ablation between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF (LVEF <=40%) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032433). The CRABL-HF study will consist of 110 patients at multicenter in Japan. The patients will be registered and randomly assigned to either the CB ablation or RF ablation group with a 1:1 allocation. The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) at 1 year with a blanking period of 90 days after ablation. Key secondary endpoints are the success rate of the pulmonary vein isolation, total procedural time, left atrial dwelling time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, complication rate, composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in quality of life.

3027,"Effect of chromosome size on aberration levels caused by gamma radiation as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique for detecting genomic alterations at the chromosome level. To study the effect of chromosome size on aberration formation, we used FISH to detect initial damage in individual prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) of gamma-irradiated G0 human cells. A linear dose response for breaks and a nonlinear dose response for exchanges was obtained using a chromosome 1-specific probe. FISH detected more chromosome 1 breaks than expected from DNA based extrapolation of Giemsa stained PCC preparations. The discrepancy in the number of breaks detected by the two techniques raised questions as to whether Giemsa staining and FISH differ in their sensitivities for detecting breaks, or is chromosome 1 uniquely sensitive to gamma-radiation. To address the question of technique sensitivity, we determined total chromosome damage by FISH using a total genomic painting probe; the results obtained from Giemsa-staining and FISH were nearly identical. To determine if chromosome 1 was uniquely sensitive, we selected four different sized chromosomes for paint probes and scored them for gamma-ray induced aberrations. In these studies the number of chromosome breaks per unit DNA increased linearly with an increase in the DNA content of the chromosomes. However, the number of exchanges per unit of DNA did not increase with an increase in chromosome size. This suggests that chromosome size may influence the levels of aberrations observed. Extrapolation from measurements of a single chromosome's damage to the whole genome requires that the relative DNA content of the measured chromosome be considered.",Excluded

SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72. ROC AUC values were 0.896/0.834/0.858/0.854 for SD-FBP/RD-FBP/RD-ASIR/RD-MBIR, respectively. RD-FBP (P = 0.002) and RD-MBIR (P = 0.032) AUCs were significantly lower than those of SD-FBP; RD-ASIR was not (P = 0.052). Reader confidence was lower for all RD series (P < 0.001) compared with SD-FBP, especially when calling patients entirely negative., CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive CT dose reduction resulted in inferior diagnostic performance and reader confidence for detection of low-contrast liver lesions compared to SD. Relative to RD-ASIR, RD-FBP showed decreased sensitivity and RD-MBIR showed decreased specificity., KEY POINTS: * Reduced-dose CECT demonstrates inferior diagnostic performance for detecting low-contrast liver lesions. * Reader confidence is lower with reduced-dose CECT compared to standard-dose CECT. * Overly aggressive dose reduction may result in misdiagnosis, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. * Careful consideration of perceived risks versus benefits of dose reduction is crucial.",Excluded

A multicolour FISH-painting protocol with the target chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 simultaneously with a pancentromeric probe was used to score potentially transmissible chromosome-type aberrations (reciprocal translocations 2B and related 'one-way' patterns I-III according to the S&S classification)., RESULTS: Individual biodosimetry estimates were obtained in terms of these potentially long-term surviving aberration types based on the linear component of a low dose-rate gamma-ray calibration curve produced using identical staining and scoring protocols. For comparison, the workers personal and total background doses were converted to red bone marrow doses. The estimated doses were mainly lower than would be predicted by the calibration curve, particularly at accumulated higher dose levels., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited life-time of circulating T-lymphocytes, the long-term persistence of translocations in vivo requires the assumption of a clonal repopulation of these naturally senescing cells from the haemopoietic stem cell compartments. Obviously such a replacement cannot be fully achieved, leading to a temporal decline even of the yield of transmissible aberrations types. Assuming further a highly selective capacity of stem cells against any type of chromosomal damage and the fact that one must rely on partial genome findings, the potential of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective dose reconstruction is probably limited to a decade or so after high-level protracted radiation exposure.",Included
1677,"Radiological evolution of coral substitute implanted into lower limb cancellous bone madreporic coral versus coralline hydroxyapatite Purpose: The study aimed to compare two successive series of procedure using first pieces of natural madreporic coral, then coralline hydroxyapatite in traumatology. The goal of this work was to evaluate long term radiological features of absorption and influencing factors. Material: Within six years, 65 pieces were used; only impaction articular fracture on the lateral tibial plateau (31) and calcaneum fractures (23) were included 21 cases completed inclusion criteria. As there were 3 secondary infections, 18 had therefore, an aseptic evolution and were included in this series. Method(s): Absorption was evaluated in five degrees according to the volume of the remaining piece on X-rays. We also took into consideration the position of the pieces and the amount of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone. Result(s): Among the 18 pieces followed up for more than 19 months (average 40), there were 4 sequestrations (1 tibia, 3 calcaneum), all were natural madreporic coral, the others presented osteointegration. Only natural madreporic coral pieces were absorbed, but never completely and the absorption was slow (3 to 7 years) and never complete. A radiolucent line was present in 7 out of 10 pieces of madreporic coral and none around coralline hydroxyapatite. Three developed favorably. Four were sequestered. Number of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone was correlated with osteointegration. Discussion(s): The calcium carbonate which makes up the natural madreporic coral pieces is the Site of destruction by osteoclasts. The radiolucent line is the specific witness of this biochemical activity. The radiolucent line preceeds sequestrations. No substitute of coralline hydroxyapatite has presented the same sign of peripheral absorption or sequestration. Coralline hydroxyapatite could be the correct coralline material to fill cancellous defect after elevation of an articular depression. In every case, the piece of coral must be fitted in contact with the cancellous bone in the depth of the bone. Conditions of osteoconduction of madreporic coral must be reconsidered. The degree and speed of peripheral absorption must be controlled before weight bearing is allowed.",Excluded

2061,"Nomogram model to predict postoperative relapse after mandibular osteoradionecrosis surgery Purpose: Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible (ORNM) is one of the most devastating complications following radiotherapy. Postoperative relapse (POR) occurs with high incidence even if a radical resection is performed. The current investigation was designed to identify prognostic factors for POR and to establish a nomogram model to estimate the risk for the onset of POR of ORNM. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective study was conducted in ORNM patients during the period from 2003 to 2016. Predictive factors for POR were preliminarily filtered by Kaplan-Meier analysis and were further confirmed by Cox regression model. A nomogram model was established to predict the risk for the onset of POR, and the performance was estimated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curve. POR was defined as the primary outcome variable and was measured using univariate and multivariate analyses. Result(s): A total of 213 patients were analyzed, and the total incidence of POR was 24.4% (52/213). In the Cox regression analysis, radiation doses >=80 Gy (versus80 Gy, OR = 3.528, P0.001, 95% CI: 1.759-7.076), location of ORNM (lesion only in mandibular body versus that involving mandibular body, angulus and ramus versus, OR = 2.900, P = 0.007, 95% CI: 1.345-6.253), S classification (S2 versus S0, OR = 8.926, P = 0.001, 95% CI: 2.487-32.036), and surgical treatment (sequestretomy versus ER + reconstruction, OR = 3.299, P = 0.012, 95% CI: 1.294-8.411) were significantly associated with POR. The current nomogram model can effectively evaluate the hazard risk and survival rate of POR. The discrimination capability was tested by the ROC curve with an area under the curve of 0.813, revealing highly predictive abilities. The calibration curve showed sufficient fitness. Conclusion(s): The current nomogram model was effective in predicting the risk of POR in ORNM patients.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

The mean change in uptake at the 2-min massage was also significantly lower than that at the 2-min control (11.11 +/- 6.97 vs. -0.85 +/- 9.78%, P<0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed between the mean changes in uptake after 1-and 2-min massages (P=0.573)., Conclusion PG massage reduced the radioiodine uptake in the PG, and the effect of PG massage for 1 min was comparable with that of PG massage for 2 min. PG massage can be applied to thyroid cancer patients who receive radioiodine therapy to reduce PG dysfunction., Background To prevent salivary dysfunction in thyroid cancer patients who have undergone radioiodine ablation, massaging the parotid gland (PG) is presumed to be helpful for the removal of radioiodine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of PG massage in the removal of radioiodine from the PG Nucl Med Commun 35:1127-1131, Methods Forty-four patients (female, 38; 49.1+/- 11.0 years) who underwent total thyroidectomy followed by I-131 ablation were included in this prospective study. Three serial salivary gland scans were performed 2 h after administration of I-123 in thyroid hormone withdrawal status. The patients were divided into two groups. There was a 1-min (or 2-min) interval between the first and second scans for control, followed by the performance of PG massage for 1 min (or 2 min) between the second and third scans.

1278,"Subacute haematotoxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA-octreotate: prognostic factors, incidence and course PURPOSE: In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), the bone marrow (BM) is one of the dose-limiting organs. The accepted dose limit for BM is 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I treatment. We investigated the incidence and duration of haematological toxicity and its risk factors in patients treated with PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)-octreotate ((177)Lu-DOTATATE). Also, absorbed BM dose estimates were evaluated and compared with the accepted 2 Gy dose limit., METHODS: The incidence and duration of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (according to CTCAE v3.0) and risk factors were analysed. Mean BM dose per unit (gigabecquerels) of administered radioactivity was calculated and the correlations between doses to the BM and haematological risk factors were determined., RESULTS: Haematological toxicity (grade 3/4) occurred in 34 (11 %) of 320 patients. In 15 of the 34 patients, this lasted more than 6 months or blood transfusions were required. Risk factors significantly associated with haematological toxicity were: poor renal function, white blood cell (WBC) count <4.0 x 10(9)/l, age over 70 years, extensive tumour mass and high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan. Previous chemotherapy was not associated. The mean BM dose per administered activity in 23 evaluable patients was 67 +/- 7 mGy/GBq, resulting in a mean BM dose of 2 Gy in patients who received four cycles of 7.4 GBq (177)Lu-DOTATATE. Significant correlations between (cumulative) BM dose and platelet and WBC counts were found in a selected group of patients., CONCLUSION: The incidence of subacute haematological toxicity after PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE is acceptable (11 %). Patients with impaired renal function, low WBC count, extensive tumour mass, high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan and/or advanced age are more likely to develop grade 3/4 haematological toxicity. The BM dose limit of 2 Gy, adopted from (131)I, seems not to be valid for PRRT with (177)Lu-DOTATATE.",Excluded
1851,"Local control and fracture risk following stereotactic body radiation therapy for non-spine bone metastases Aims: To report local control and toxicity rates for patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for non-spine bone metastases. Methods and materials: Eighty-one patients with 106 non-spine bone metastases were treated between 2011 and 2014 and retrospectively reviewed. Indications included: oligometastases (63%), oligoprogression (17.3%), retreatment (2.4%) or other (17.3%). Cumulative incidence function was used to assess local recurrence and fracture probability. Bivariate relationships were investigated based on selected patient, tumour and dose-volume factors. Result(s): Mean follow-up was 13 months (range, 0.25-45.6) and the median patient age was 66.4 years (range, 36-86). Most patients were male (60.5%) and the predominant histology prostate cancer (32%). Bone metastases were most commonly located in the pelvis (41.5%) and almost half sclerotic. The most common prescriptions were 30 Gy/5 (30.2%) and 35 Gy/5 (42.5%). The cumulative incidence of local recurrence at 6,18 and 24 months respectively was 4.7%, 8.3% and 13.3% with a mean time to local recurrence of 11.8 months (range, 3.9-23.4). A significant association was found between local recurrence and volume of the PTV (p = 0.02), with larger PTVs having a greater risk of local failure. Fracture was observed radiographically in the treatment volume in 9/106 (8.5%) of treated lesions and the mean time to fracture was 8.4 months (range, 0.7-32.5 months). With respect to predictors, a trend was observed for lytic lesions (p = 0.11) and female gender (p = 0.09).

2802,"Growth factor treatment prior to low-dose total body irradiation increases donor cell engraftment after bone marrow transplantation in mice Low-toxicity conditioning regimens prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are widely explored. We developed a new protocol using hematopoietic growth factors prior to low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in recipients of autologous transplants to establish high levels of long-term donor cell engraftment. We hypothesized that treatment of recipient mice with growth factors would selectively deplete stem cells, resulting in successful long-term donor cell engraftment after transplantation. Recipient mice were treated for 1 or 7 days with growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF] plus interleukin 11 [IL-11], SCF plus Flt-3 ligand [FL], or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) prior to low-dose TBI (4 Gy). Donor cell chimerism was measured after transplantation of congenic bone marrow cells. High levels of donor cell engraftment were observed in recipients pretreated for 7 days with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. Although 1-day pretreatments with these cytokines initially resulted in reduced donor cell engraftment, a continuous increase in time was observed, finally resulting in highly significantly increased levels of donor cell contribution. In contrast, G-CSF treatment showed no beneficial effects on long-term engraftment. In vitro stem cell assays demonstrated the effect of cytokine treatment on stem cell numbers. Donor cell engraftment and number of remaining recipient stem cells after TBI were strongly inversely correlated, except for groups treated for 1 day with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. We conclude that long-term donor cell engraftment can be strongly augmented by treatment of recipient mice prior to low-dose TBI with hematopoietic growth factors that act on primitive cells.",Excluded

In the present study we verified the accuracy and validated the clinical use of an augmented reality navigation system produced to perform percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsies., METHODS: One hundred and eighty consecutive patients with solitary parenchymal lung lesions, enrolled using a nonrandom enrollment system, underwent percutaneous CT-guided aspiration and core biopsy using a traditional technique (group C, 90 patients) and navigation system assistance (group S, 90 patients). For each patient we recorded the largest lesion diameter, procedure time, overall number of CT scans, radiation dose, and complications. The entire experimental project was evaluated and approved by the local institutional review board (ethics committee)., RESULTS: Each procedure was concluded successfully and a pathological diagnosis was reached in 96% of cases in group S and 90% of cases in group C. Procedure time, overall number of CT scans and incident x-ray radiation dose (CTDIvol) were significantly reduced in navigation system-assisted procedures (P <0.001; z = 5.64) compared with traditional CT-guided procedures. The percentage of procedural complications was 14% in group S and 17% in group C., CONCLUSION: The augmented reality navigation system used in this study was a highly safe, technically reliable and effective support tool in percutaneous CT-guided lung biopsy, allowing to shorten the procedure time and reduce the incident x-ray radiation dose to patients and the rate of insufficient specimens. Furthermore, it has the potential to increase the number of procedures executed in the allocated time without increasing the number of complications.",Excluded

2904,"Which is the preferred modality of renal access for a trainee urologist: Ultrasonography or fluoroscopy? results of a prospective randomized trial Background and Purpose: In percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), placement of the access tract into the kidney is an important aspect of the procedure and is responsible for the steep learning curve associated with the operation. The aim of the current prospective randomized trial was to assess the duration of radiation exposure along with the safety and efficacy of PCNL done by a trainee, utilizing either ultrasonography (US) or fluoroscopic guidance to obtain access., Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with <=3cm renal calculi undergoing single-tract PCNL by trainee urologists (experience of <25 PCNL's) were randomized into US-and fluoroscopic-guided access groups (32 in each). In Group 1 (US guided), puncture was done using a 3.5/5MHz US probe with a puncture attachment, whereas the triangulation technique with biplanar C-arm fluoroscopy was utilized in group 2 (fluoroscopic guided). Patient demographics, stone parameters, intraoperative characteristics, fluoroscopy durations, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed., Results: Both groups were comparable as far as patient and stone characteristics were concerned. The fluoroscopy exposure during the puncture phase (T2) and overall (T) was significantly lower in the US group at 9.0+/-20.8 vs 43.8+/-34.8, (p<0.0001) and 204.3+/-84 vs 239.9+/-77.5, (p=0.04).

A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. METHOD(S): Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. RESULT(S): From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. CONCLUSION(S): This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases.

3061,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included
405,"Efficacy of sucralfate ointment in the prevention of acute proctitis in cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial Background: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a usual adverse effect in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. The symptoms include diarrhea, rectal blood or mucus discharge, fecal urgency and tenesmus with pain. Sucralfate, an aluminum-based salt of sucrose octasulfate, is a cytoprotective agent that forms a coating barrier at injured sites by adhering to mucoproteins. It has been used in topical management of a wide variety of local lesion. This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of rectal sucralfate on acute radiotherapy induced proctitis. Method(s): Seven percent sucralfate ointment was prepared for topical use. Drug quantification, chemical stability and microbial limit tests were performed carefully. In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, fifty-seven patients with pelvic malignancies undergoing radiotherapy were allocated to receive either 1 g of sucralfate or 1 g of placebo, given as a twice daily ointment, one day before and during radiotherapy for six weeks. The eligible patients were evaluated based on RTOG acute toxicity criteria and the following ARP symptoms weekly: Rectal hemorrhage, diarrhea, rectal pain, and fecal urgency. The influence of symptoms on lifestyle was also recorded weekly. Result(s): Acute proctitis was significantly less prevalent in patients in the sucralfate group. The incidence of rectal bleeding (P=0.003), diarrhea (P=0.002), rectal pain (P=<0.001) and fecal urgency (P=0.002) was significantly less common in the sucralfate group. No statistical significant difference was observed for radiotherapy induced cystitis in the placebo and sucralfate groups (P=0.27).

975,"Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of gamma-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory (trained immunity"") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited. Copyright © Society for Leukocyte Biology.""",Excluded

Sites treated included liver (n = 10), abdominal lymph nodes (n = 1), and adrenal gland (n = 1). SBRT was delivered in three (n = 2) or five (n = 10) consecutive daily fractions over one week. The median prescription dose was 55 Gy (range, 45-60). Treatment response was graded by RECIST v.1.1, and toxicities were scored by CTCAE v.4.0. Data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control (LC), freedom from distant progression (FFDM) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up was 14 months (range, 2-26 months). LC, defined as freedom from progression within the SBRT field, was 100%, but four patients treated to intrahepatic sites experienced progression elsewhere in the liver. Estimates for FFDM at 6 and 12 months were 73% and 31%, respectively. Sites of disease relapse included liver (n = 3), liver and lymph nodes (n = 1), liver and lungs (n = 1), lymph nodes (n = 1), and mesentery (n = 1). OS estimates for the cohort at 6 and 12 months were 83% and 73%, respectively. The most common Grade >=2 early toxicities were Grade 2 nausea and vomiting (n = 5) and gastrointestinal pain (n = 2). Late >=2 toxicities included Grade 2 gastrointestinal pain (n = 3), Grade 3 biliary stenosis (n = 1), and Grade 5 liver failure (n = 1). Conclusion(s): SBRT shows promise as an effective local therapy for properly-selected patients with cholangiocarcinoma. Further follow-up is needed to better quantify the risk of late complications associated with SBRT. © 2012 Barney et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2856,"Identification of a novel mutation in ATP13A2 associated with a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia Objective To establish molecular diagnosis for a family with a complicated form of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with intellectual disability, cognitive decline, psychosis, peripheral neuropathy, upward gaze palsy, and thin corpus callosum (TCC). Methods Physical examinations, laboratory tests, structural neuroimaging studies, and exome sequence analysis were carried out. Results The 3 patients exhibited intellectual disability and progressive intellectual decline accompanied by psychiatric symptoms. Gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness appeared at the ages of 20s-30s. Brain MRI revealed TCC with atrophic changes in the frontotemporal lobes, caudate nuclei, and cerebellum. Exome sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous c.2654C>A (p. Ala885Asp) variant in the ATP13A2, a gene responsible for a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG78), Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. The predominant clinical presentations of the patients include progressive intellectual disability and gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness, consistent with the diagnosis of SPG78. Of note, prominent psychiatric symptoms and extrapyramidal signs including rigidity, dystonia, and involuntary movements preceded the spastic paraparesis. Conclusions Our study further broadens the clinical spectrum associated with ATP13A2 mutations.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
2829,"Influence of preoperative femoral orientation on radiographic measures of femoral head height in total hip replacement Background: In total hip arthroplasty the surgeon aims to restore the biomechanics of the joint. Femoral height has the greatest influence on restoring limb length and contributes equally to the restoration of femoral head centre. On X-ray, the level of femoral neck resection is most often referenced off the upper border of lesser trochanter. Less frequently, femoral head centre is referenced from the tip of the greater trochanter. The error in measurement of femoral height resulting from unknown femoral rotation is crucially important and can result in inappropriate surgical planning for implant selection and placement. It is unknown which reference produces lower error. Method(s): A sample of femoral shapes was generated using a femoral statistical shape model. These were placed in a range of orientations in terms of external rotation and flexion, at intervals of 10degree. Simulated X-rays were then produced and the distances from the tip of either greater or lesser trochanter to femoral head centre were measured. Finding(s): Although using greater trochanter as a reference demonstrated greater errors at the extremes, both techniques resulted in errors of 7-8 mm with 20degree of both femoral external rotation and flexion. Interpretation(s): Moderate degrees of femoral external rotation combined with flexion can result in unsatisfactory errors when templating limb length. There should be greater focus and an agreed definition for femoral height. There is a clinical need for a method with a lower error in determining true femoral height and the level of neck resection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
375,"LED photoprevention: reduced MED response following multiple LED exposures BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As photoprotection with traditional sunscreen presents some limitations, the use of non-traditional treatments to increase skin resistance to ultraviolet (UV) induced damage would prove particularly appealing. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the potential of non-thermal pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) treatments (660 nm) prior to UV exposure in the induction of a state of cellular resistance against UV-induced erythema., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects and two patients with polymorphous light eruption (PLE) were exposed to 5, 6, or 10 LED treatments (660 nm) on an EXPERIMENTAL anterior thigh region. Individual baseline minimal erythema doses (MED) were then determined. UV radiation was thereafter performed on the LED EXPERIMENTAL and CONTROL anterior thigh areas. Finally, 24 hours post-UV irradiation, LED pre-treated MED responses were compared to the non-treated sites., RESULTS: Reduction of erythema was considered significant when erythema was reduced by >50% on the LED-treated side as opposed to CONTROL side. A significant LED treatment reduction in UV-B induced erythema reaction was observed in at least one occasion in 85% of subjects, including patients suffering from PLE. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-related pattern in results. Finally, a sun protection factor SPF-15-like effect and a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were observed on the LED pre-treated side., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that LED based therapy prior to UV exposure provided significant protection against UV-B induced erythema. The induction of cellular resistance to UV insults may possibly be explained by the induction of a state a natural resistance to the skin via specific cell signaling pathways and without the drawbacks and limitations of traditional sunscreens. These results represent an encouraging step towards expanding the potential applications of LED therapy and could be useful in the treatment of patients with anomalous reactions to sunlight.",Excluded
972,"MR enterography in the investigation of unexplained abdominal pain Introduction: Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) has an established role in the management of patients with small bowel (SB) Crohn's disease (CD)1 and has the advantages of diagnosing extra-enteric lesions which may be clinically significant2 and being free from the risks of radiation exposure. There is little published data on the use of MRE in the investigation of patients with unexplained chronic abdominal pain. Method(s): A retrospective review of casenotes was conducted of patients who underwent MRE at Southend University Hospital to investigate unexplained abdominal pain and suspected SB disease between January 2008 and October 2010. The patients did not have a pre-existing diagnosis of CD made by colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy (CE). Demographic data, symptoms, previous investigations and final diagnosis were recorded. MRE was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner following a minimum 6-hour fast and preparation with Klean prep an hour prior to the scan. Two T2-weighted sequences single-shot fast spin-echo and fast imaging employing steady state acquisition were performed in the axial and coronal planes. Result(s): 181 patients (60 male, 121 female) underwent MRE: 43 also had diarrhoea, 14 weight loss and 13 vomiting. The median age was 39 years (range 13 - 85). MRE found clinically significant abnormalities in 33 patients (18.2%): 18/33 had a prior abdominal CT scan, MRE was used to clarify CT findings in 9/33. Findings are as follows: - 12 SB CD (3 CT suggestive) - 3 SB carcinoid tumour (1 CT suggestive, 1 CE suggestive) - 4 adhesional SB obstruction (2 CT abnormal) - 1 SB stricture - 1 gastric GIST - confirmed at resection (normal CT and gastroscopy) - 1 jejunal tumour - adenocarcinoma at resection (normal CT) - 1 duodenal mass with intussusception - villous adenoma at resection (OGD and CT suggestive) - 1 ovarian endometrioma and 1 renal cell carcinoma - confirmed at biopsy or resection - 1 peritoneal metastases - metastatic breast carcinoma at biopsy (CT: colonic thickening and free fluid) - 1 intussusception - 1 splenic mass (CT: splenic mass, granulomatous disease on resection) - 1 retroperitoneal nodes and splenomegaly (CT similar findings, further investigation hypogammaglobulinaemia) - 1 persistent vitello-intestinal cyst (CT normal, confirmed on resection) - 1 gallstones and cholecystitis - 1 PUJ obstruction (CT similar findings) - 1 colonic diverticular disease Conclusion(s): MRE is a useful investigation for unexplained chronic abdominal pain in patients not known to have CD. It yields clinically significant enteric and extra-enteric findings and carries no risk of radiation exposure.",Excluded
1675,"Radiation-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis in Long-Term Esophageal Cancer Survivors Purpose: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is a potential lethal complication. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included
39,"A comparison of normal tissue complication probability of brain for proton and photon therapy of canine nasal tumors This study compared the calculated normal tissue complication probability of brain in dogs with a nasal tumor, which had both photon and proton treatment planning. Nine dogs diagnosed with a variety of histologies, but all with large, caudally located nasal tumors were studied. Three-dimensional (3-D) photon dose distribution, and a proton dose distribution was calculated for each dog. To calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for brain, the partial brain volume irradiated with the prescribed dose was determined, then a mathematic model relating complications to partial volume and radiation dose was used. The NTCP was always smaller for proton plans as compared to photon plans, indicating conformation of the dose to the target allows a higher dose to be given. If a 5% NTCP were accepted, the mean applicable dose for this group of dogs was 50.2 Gy for photons, but 58.3 Gy for protons. Not all dogs would benefit the same from proton irradiation. If a large partial brain volume has to be irradiated, the advantage becomes minimal. There is also a minimal advantage if the planning target volume (PTV) includes a small, superficial brain volume. However, for a complex PTV shape the degree of conformation is clearly superior for protons and results in smaller calculated NTCPs.",Excluded
1416,"Kennedy Space Center Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Program evaluation This program evaluation examined the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Reduction Program which aims to identify CVD risk factors and reduce these risk factors through health education phone counseling. High risk participants (those having two or more elevated lipid values) are identified from monthly voluntary CVD screenings and counseled. Phone counseling consists of reviewing lab values with the participant, discussing dietary fat intake frequency using an intake questionnaire, and promoting the increase in exercise frequency. The participants are followed-up at two-months and five-months for relevant metrics including blood pressure, weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, dietary fat intake, and exercise frequency. Data for three years of the KSC CVD Program included 366 participants, average age of 49 years, 75% male, and 25% female. For those with complete two and five month follow-up data, significant baseline to two-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.03); diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.002); total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary fat intake (all three at p < 0.0001) as well as a significant increase in exercise frequency (p = 0.04). Significant baseline to five-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in triglycerides (p = 0.05); and total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary intake (all three at p < 0.0001). These program evaluation results indicate that providing brief phone health education counseling and information at the worksite to high risk CVD participants may impact CVD risk factors.",Excluded

The chemical treatment of folic acid (FA) with low molecular weight CS is carried out to prepare FACS complex based on the reaction between [Formula presented]2 group of CS and gamma-COOH group of FA. The structure and properties of FACS complex was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV, SEM, TEM, DLS and XRD analyses. TEM and DLS results showed that FACS complex has nanostructure and the mean size of particles was unimodal with average diameters in the range of 165-252 nm. Radiolabeling of FACS complex (99mTc-FACS) was done with Technetium-99 m (99mTc). The optimum conditions of labeling were investigated. The labeling yield was 85% at pH = 6 and 30 min reaction time. The effect of time on the stability of 99mTc-FACS complex was studied and the results revealed that it is stable up to 6 h after labeling. Biodistribution studies of 99mTc-FACS complex in Quail showed that it distributed to different organs mainly in blood, liver and kidney. The results revealed that the uptake of 99mTc-FACS in the sexual organs (ovary and ovarian) of female Quail was higher than that in the sexual organs (testes) of male Quail, so 99mTc-FACS could be used to differentiate between them. It also showed that FACS is consumed and more essential in female than that in male.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1920,"New recommendation and coverage of low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening: uptake has increased but is still low BACKGROUND: In 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued recommendations for low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening (LDCT-LCS), but there continues to be a dearth of information on the adoption of LDCT-LCS in healthcare systems. Using a multilevel perspective, our study aims to assess referrals for LDCT-LCS and identify facilitators and barriers to adoption following recent policy changes. METHOD(S): A retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data from patients aged 55-80 years with no history of lung cancer who visited a primary care provider in a large healthcare system in California during 2010-2016 (1,572,538 patient years). Trends in documentation of smoking history, number of eligible patients, and lung cancer screening orders were assessed. Using Hierarchical Generalized Linear Models, we also evaluated provider-level and patient-level factors associated with lung cancer screening orders among 970 primary care providers and 12,801 eligible patients according to USPSTF guidelines between January 1st, 2014 and December 31st, 2016. RESULT(S): Documentation of smoking history to determine eligibility (59.2% in 2010 to 77.8% in 2016) and LDCT-LCS orders (0% in 2010 to 7.3% in 2016) have increased since USPSTF guidelines. Patient factors associated with increased likelihood of lung cancer screening orders include: younger patient age (78-80 vs. 55-64 years old: OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7), Asian race (vs. Non-Hispanic White: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4), reported current smoking (vs. former smoker: OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.4-2.0), no severe comorbidity (severe vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.2, 95% CI=0.1-0.3; moderate vs. no major comorbidity: OR=0.5; 95% CI=0.4-0.7), and making a visit to own primary care provider (vs. other primary care providers: OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-3.4). Appropriate referral for lung cancer screening varies considerably across primary care providers. Provider factors include being a female physician (vs. male: OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and receiving medical training in the US (foreign vs. US medical school graduates: OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.3-0.7). CONCLUSION(S): Future interventions to improve lung cancer screening may be more effective if they focus on accurate documentation of smoking history and target former smokers who do not regularly see their own primary care providers.",Excluded
2715,"Addition of Astatine-211-Labeled Anti-CD45 Antibody to TBI as Conditioning for DLA-Identical Marrow Transplantation: A Novel Strategy to Overcome Graft Rejection in a Canine Presensitization Model: ""Radioimmunotherapy to Overcome Transfusion-Induced Sensitization"" In a canine model of presensitization using donor blood transfusions, 100% of historical control dogs receiving 9.2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning before dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical marrow grafts had graft rejection. In this presensitization model, we investigated whether the addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with astatine-211 (211At) to TBI could overcome graft rejection. 211At is an alpha-particle-emitting isotope that has a short path length, very high energy, and a short t1/2 of 7.2 hours, which allowed targeting radiation to the T cells responsible for graft rejection. Normal canine recipients were given three preceding transfusions of unirradiated whole blood on days -24, -17, and -10 before transplant from their DLA-identical marrow donors. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb was administered on day -3, and TBI followed by marrow grafts on day 0. Six of the 7 dogs (86%) achieved sustained engraftment as assessed by 100% donor chimerism in mononuclear cells, granulocytes, and CD3+ T cells. One dog receiving the lowest CD34+ cell content (0.35 x 106 cells/kg) rejected the graft. There were no late rejections in dogs followed up to 1 year. Graft-versus-host disease was seen in one dog. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb in combination with TBI as conditioning was successful in abrogating graft rejection in 86% of dogs in this presensitization model. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb conditioning with TBI may serve as a novel promising strategy to overcome graft rejection in heavily transfused patients with red cell disorders.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy",Excluded
3222,"Rapid High-Throughput Diagnostic Triage after a Mass Radiation Exposure Event Using Early Gene Expression Changes Radiological exposure scenarios involving large numbers of people require a rapid and high-throughput method to identify the unexposed, and those exposed to low- and high-dose radiation. Those with high-dose exposure, e.g., >2 Gy and depending on host characteristics, may develop severe hematological acute radiation syndrome (HARS), requiring hospitalization and treatment. Previously, we identified a set of genes that discriminated these clinically relevant groups. In the current work, we examined the utility of gene expression changes to classify 1,000 split blood samples into HARS severity scores of H0, H1 and H2-4, with the latter indicating likely hospitalization. In several previous radiation dose experiments, we determined that these HARS categories corresponded, respectively, to doses of 0 Gy (unexposed), 0.5 Gy and 5 Gy. The main purpose of this work was to assess the rapidity of blood sample processing using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Peripheral blood samples from two healthy donors were X-ray irradiated in vitro and incubated at 37degreeC for 24 h. A total of 1,000 samples were evaluated by laboratory personnel blinded to the radiation dose. Changes in gene expression of FDXR, DDB2, POU2AF1 and WNT3 were examined with qRT-PCR as positive controls. Targeted NGS (TREX) was used on all samples for the same four genes. Agreement using both methods was almost 78%. Using NGS, all 1,000 samples were processed within 30 h. Classification of the HARS severity categories corresponding to radiation dose had an overall agreement ranging between 90-97%. Depending on the end point, either a combination of all genes or FDXR alone (H0 HARS or unexposed) provided the best classification. Using this optimized automated methodology, we assessed 100x more samples approximately three times faster compared to standard cytogenetic studies. We showed that a small set of genes, rather than a complex constellation of genes, provided robust positive (97%) and negative (97%) predictive values for HARS categories and radiation doses of 0, 0.5 and 5 Gy. The findings of this study support the potential utility of early radiation-induced gene expression changes for high-throughput biodosimetry and rapid identification of irradiated persons in need of hospitalization.",Excluded

The study was carried out on 18 experimental guinea pigs subjected to 5 successive exposures of 150 rads 3 or 4 days apart. The control animals were sham radiated but were otherwise treated identically as those of the experimental groups. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture before radiation and 30 min after each exposure of 150 rads. The red cells were re-suspended in their own plasma and HMP pathway activity was measured in the suspension. The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol. The enzyme activity in the red cells of the experimental group varied between 34.90 +/- 2.17 to 161.95 +/- 5.34 I.U./ml erythrocyte pack.

140,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001).

555,"Chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection: an experience with 22 patients The authors present their experience of chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection in 22 patients. The patients are from a series of 80 patients treated by chest wall resection from 1967 to 1989. Whether performed on breasts still in place, for recurrent disease, or for radiation-induced lesions (which are often associated), the defect created by complete resection of the chest wall layers causes difficulties. Large cutaneous flaps, often including the opposite breast were used at the beginning of the series. Then came omentum associated to Mersilene mesh and myocutaneous flaps. The results, in terms of comfort and local control are acceptable, even though surgery is only palliative for cancer patients. We feel that full thickness chest wall resection is the only effective treatment for some primary and recurrent malignant tumors and for extensive thoracic radionecroses. Such procedures are designed to improve the patient's quality of life even if they do not actually prolong survival. The goals guiding the reconstruction programme are: (1) the restoration of a stable parietal rigidity; and (2) the reconstruction of long lasting superficial layers.",Excluded
747,"Dose-escalation with CHARTWEL (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy week-end less) combined with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer PURPOSE: a radiation-dose-escalation study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic benefit of combining accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT) with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients with locally advanced NSCLC were entered into a phase II trial of CHARTWEL (CHART Week-End-Less) 54 Gy or 60 Gy with or without three cycles of CT. Acute oesophageal reactions and analgesia were scored for up to 8 weeks after the start of RT. Pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, spinal cord and oesophageal strictures, were assessed using clinical and radiological criteria from 3 months onwards and throughout the study. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was monitored in those patients undergoing CT. Endpoints for treatment outcome were overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional control., RESULTS: Chemotherapy enhanced the incidence and duration of acute dysphagia,but the increase was transient. Healing occurred in all cases and there has been no evidence of long-term oesophageal complications. Clinically, almost 25% of those receiving CT+RT had Grade 2 pneumonitis, higher than seen with RT alone. However, the 1 patient with severe Grade 3 pneumonitis was in the RT 60 Gy alone group. An incidence of 17% Grade 2 pulmonary fibrosis at 2 years was seen with CT, slightly lower than with RT alone. To date, there is no evidence of Grade 3 lung fibrosis. There was a higher scoring of lung damage with the radiological endpoint, which gave no indication that CT increased pulmonary toxicity over that of RT alone. Loco-regional control at 2 years was 37% and 55% for CHARTWEL 54 Gy and 60 Gy alone compared with 72% in those treated with 60 Gy and neo-adjuvant CT However, this did not translate into a survival advantage., CONCLUSIONS: This study of CHARTWEL combined with induction chemotherapy, has shown that the strategy is feasible and that a possible therapeutic benefit may be obtained by the addition of CT. Although neo-adjuvant treatment increased acute mucosal reactions and slight-to-moderate pneumonitis seen with CHARTWEL 60 Gy, the clinical management and quality of life of these patients is similar to those treated with radiotherapy alone.",Excluded
273,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.

Interventional bronchoscopic management continues to be the main modality in the management of these problems., METHODS: Four patients with airway stenoses after lung transplantation received high dose rate brachytherapy for management of recurrent stenosis. All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction. The radiation dose for all 4 patients was 3 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the center of the catheter., RESULTS: All four patients have had routine follow-up after endobronchial brachytherapy treatments. Of the 4 patients, 2 treated with this modality showed a significant response to therapy in that the bronchus remained free of obstruction after treatment; 1 patient had partial improvement, and 1 patient failed to show significant improvement and expired from the sequelae of persistent airway obstruction., CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial brachytherapy can be an effective modality for managing recurrent stenoses caused by hyperplastic granulation tissue at the bronchial anastomosis.

1674,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography in the non-invasive evaluation of significant coronary artery disease Aims Multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) has emerged as a feasible imaging modality for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, 320-row CTA systems were introduced, with 16 cm anatomical coverage, allowing image acquisition of the entire heart within a single heart beat. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 320-row CTA in patients with known or suspected CAD. Methods and resultsA total of 64 patients (34 male, mean age 61 +/- 16 years) underwent CTA and invasive coronary angiography. All CTA scans were evaluated for the presence of obstructive coronary stenosis by a blinded expert, and results were compared with quantitative coronary angiography.

Moreover, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=70 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 94, 95, 88, and 98, respectively. With inclusion of non-diagnostic imaging studies, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 81, 88, and 100, respectively. Conclusion The current study shows that 320-row CTA allows accurate non-invasive assessment of significant CAD. © 2010 The Author.",Excluded
577,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

0,Efficacy of radiation therapy for the treatment of macroscopic canine oral soft tissue sarcoma This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p=0.2292). The results of this study suggest that radiation therapy is useful in the treatment of oral soft tissue sarcoma.,Excluded
1064,"Effects of X-rays and cigarette smoking on leukocyte, lymphocyte and mitotic index values and SCE rates: the relationship between mitotic index and lymphocyte count Many previous studies revealed that smoking increases leukocyte and lymphocyte counts while exposure to X-rays decreases these counts. However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included
2073,"Comparison of Interlaminar and Transforaminal Approaches for Treatment of L5/S1 Disc Herniation by Percutaneous Endoscopic Discectomy Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) and percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PETD) in treating L5/S1 disc herniation. Method(s): A retrospective analysis of 76 patients with L5/S1 intervertebral disc herniation was performed. There were two surgical treatment groups: one with patients receiving PEID and the other with patients receiving PETD. The two groups were compared by length of surgery, times of intraoperative X-ray exposure, postoperative time in bed, length of hospital stay, operative complications, patient's assessment of pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS), and disability using the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. Result(s): Subjects in the PEID group were in surgery for 60.90 +/- 13.11 min and needed intraoperative X-ray exposure 4.10 +/- 1.09 times. Patients in this group were ambulatory by 7.52 +/- 1.08 h after surgery and were hospitalized for 5.05 +/- 0.92 days. In contrast, patients in the PETD group were in surgery for 84.06 +/- 15.58 min and needed intraoperative X ray exposure 12.81 +/- 8.46 times. These patients were ambulatory by 7.06 +/- 0.91 h after surgery and remained in the hospital for 4.94 +/- 0.80 days. Based on these data, operation time and fluoroscopy time were significantly less (P < 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively) for subjects in the PEID group. However, ambulatory time and hospitalization were similar for both in terms of pain relief and decreased disability, and subjects in both groups responded well to the surgery and showed a significant decrease in both VAS and ODI scores at their 1-year follow-up (P < 0.01). Furthermore, there were no statistically significant differences between the two surgeries in terms of pain relief and decrease in disability. Conclusion(s): For L5/S1 disc herniation, PEID and PETD provide similar results for patients. However, PEID has the advantage over PETD in that it is a shorter procedure and exposes the patient to less radiation. Keywords.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

552,"Estimating the risk of cancer and the hazardous index due to radiation from the phosphate mine in Russifa area Phosphate mines are considered prone to high radioactivity. The Russifa area contains one of the largest phosphate mines in Jordan. The hazardous index is high at 1.503 and 1.24, while the radium equivalent activity concentrations were 556.9 and 459.9 for phosphate pile and zoo, respectively. These values exceed the permissible levels in residential areas. The annual radiation doses at the site equals 36.4 and 30.1 mSv for the phosphate pile and zoo, respectively and these values pose a significant risk on the nearby population. Cancer risk is high in all body tissues, especially in the colon for both males and females. It is therefore imperative that these sites be rehabilitated and with a priority objective to reduce the annual dose rate to permissible levels and consequently the risk of cancer.",Included

Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 200 patients (100 male, 100 female; mean age 61.2 +/- 13.5 years, mean body mass index 27.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) equally divided into four groups matched by gender and body mass index, who had undergone portal venous phase abdominal CT with second-generation (group A, 120-kV-SECT; group B, 80/140-kV-DECT) and third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV-SECT; group D, 90/150-kV-DECT). The radiation dose was normalised for 40-cm scan length. Dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for various organs and vessels. Subjective overall image quality and reader confidence were assessed. Result(s): The effective normalised radiation dose was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in groups C (6.2 +/- 2.0 mSv) and D (5.3 +/- 1.9 mSv, P = 0.103) compared to groups A (8.8 +/- 2.3 mSv) and B (9.7 +/- 2.4 mSv, P = 0.102). Dose-independent FOM-CNR peaked for liver, kidney, and portal vein measurements (all P <= 0.0285) in group D. Subjective image quality and reader confidence were consistently rated as excellent in all groups (all >=1.53 out of 5). Conclusion(s): With both DSCT generations, abdominal DECT can be routinely performed without radiation dose penalty compared to SECT, while third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency. Key Points: * Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows for single- and dual-energy image acquisition. * Dual-energy acquisition does not increase the radiation dose in abdominal DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency compared to second-generation DSCT. * Dose-independent figure-of-merit image contrast was highest with third-generation dual-energy DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency for SECT and DECT.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2817,"The use of Gamma-irradiated proximal femoral allografts for bone stock reconstruction in complex revision hip arthroplasty We have followed a consecutive series of 49 revision hip arthroplasties, performed for severe femoral bone loss using Gamma-irradiated anatomic-specific proximal femoral allografts longer than five centimetres. The patients were followed for a median 10.2 years, with a five year minimum follow-up. The median preoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) improved from 42 points to 77 points postoperatively. In four hips the femoral component was further revised for non-union of the allograft and aseptic failure. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were removed because of infection. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were re-revised for host step-cut fracture. Junctional-union was observed in 44/49 hips. By defining success as an increase of HHS by 20 points or more, a stable implant and no need for any subsequent re-operations related to the allograft and /or the implant, a success rate of 76% was observed. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis predicted 79% rate of survival at 10 years and 75% rate of survival at 17 years, with the need for further revision of the allograft and/or implant as the end point. Three hips underwent re-attachment of the greater trochanter for trochanteric escape. Asymptomatic non-union of the greater trochanter was noticed in another three hips. Moderate allograft resorption was observed in four hips. Two fractures of the host step-cut occurred. There were four dislocations. Good long-term results with the use of large anatomic-specific femoral allografts justify their continued use in cases of revision hip arthroplasty complicated with severe femoral bone loss.",Excluded
1444,"Lack of correlation between villus and crypt damage in irradiated mouse intestine It has been observed that scanning electron microscopy is a more sensitive indicator of mucosal damage at low radiation dose levels than conventional quantitative crypt counting techniques. Three different fractionation schedules were subjected to investigation by both of these methods to try to elucidate some features of irradiation damage to the whole of the intestinal mucosa, at dose levels commonly used in clinical practice. Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease. Variations in the qualitative observations were seen in all the schedules so that their interpretation in terms of perturbation of cellular kinetics is difficult.",Included

Donor lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated expanded recipient T lymphocytes in an ex vivo mixed lymphocyte reaction. Alloactivated T cells preferentially retaining the photosensitizer 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402) were eliminated by exposure to visible light. Twenty-four patients with hematologic malignancies (16 high risk) conditioned with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and totalbody irradiation received a CD34-selected stem cell allograft from an HLA-matched sibling along with 5 x 106/kg selectively depleted donor T cells. Low-dose cyclosporine was used for posttransplantation immunosuppression. Eleven patients survived at a median of 30 months. Probabilities (+/- SEM) for overall and disease-free survival are 39% +/- 12% and 30% +/- 12%, respectively, whereas grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 13% +/- 7%. Six patients relapsed, with a relapse probability of 27% +/- 10%.

Nine patients who did not agree with radiation therapy, and therefore underwent rotational atherectomy and balloon angioplasty for diffuse in-stent restenosis in the same study period, were selected for control groups. Serial IVUS comparisons were available in 44 of 50 patients with radiation therapy and 7 of 9 control patients. At 6-month follow-up, there was less significant increase of IH area in patients with radiation therapy than in control patients (Delta IH area = 0.1 +/- 0.8 mm(2) vs. 2.6 +/- 1.8 mm(2), P > 0.001 in mean values, and 0.6 +/- 1.4 mm(2) vs. 2.9 +/- 2.1 mm(2), P = 0.026 in values of follow-up lesion site, respectively).

2487,"Transcriptional corepressor MTG16 regulates small intestinal crypt proliferation and crypt regeneration after radiation-induced injury Myeloidtranslocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressorsimplicated in development, malignancy, differentiation, and stem cellfunction. While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included
1776,"Prognostic value of the micronucleus assay for clinical endpoints in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer BACKGROUND: The question whether lymphocyte radiosensitivity is representative of patients' response to radiotherapy (RT) remains unsolved. We analyzed lymphocyte cytogenetic damage in patients who were homogeneously treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for rectal cancer within clinical trials. We tested for interindividual variation and consistent radiosensitivity after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation, analyzed the effect of patients' and RCT characteristics on cytogenetic damage, and tested for correlations with patients' outcome in terms of tumor response, survival and treatment-related toxicity., METHODS: The cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMNcyt) assay was performed on the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLCs) of 134 patients obtained before, during, at the end of RCT, and during the 2-year follow-up. A subset of PBLCs obtained before RCT was irradiated in-vitro with 3 Gy. RCT included 50.4 Gy of pelvic RT with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone (n = 78) or 5-FU plus oxaliplatin (n = 56). The analyzed variables included patients' age, gender, RT characteristics (planning target volume size [PTV size], RT technique), and chemotherapy characteristics (5-FU plasma levels, addition of oxaliplatin). Outcome was analyzed as tumor regression, patient survival, and acute and late toxicity., RESULTS: Cytogenetic damage increased significantly with the radiation dose and varied substantially between individuals. Women were more sensitive than men; no significant age-dependent differences were observed. There was a significant correlation between the cytogenetic damage after in-vitro irradiation and in-vivo RCT. We found a significant effect of the PTV size on the yields of cytogenetic damage after RCT, while the RT technique had no effect. Neither the addition of oxaliplatin nor the 5-FU levels influenced cytogenetic damage. We found no correlation between patient outcome and the cytogenetic damage., CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes after in-vivo RCT and in-vitro irradiation. Gender was confirmed as a well-known, and the PTV size was identified as a less well-known influencing variable on lymphocyte cytogenetic damage after partial-body irradiation. A consistent level of cytogenetic damage after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation may indicate the importance of genetic factors for individual radiosensitivity. However, we found no evidence that in-vivo or in-vitro irradiation-induced cytogenetic damage is an adequate biomarker for the response to RCT in rectal cancer patients.",Excluded
1038,"Trends in radiation dose and technique for anal canal squamous cell carcinoma Background: Anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is managed definitively with chemo and XRT, reserving surgery for salvage. Many different radiation dose schemes have been used, varying from 30 Gy to doses exceeding 60 Gy. RTOG 0529 established IMRT as a standard of care for anal canal SCC, using doses of 50.4-54 Gy. We used the National Cancer Database(NCDB) to examine trends in dose selection and radiation technique over time, as well as any potential effect on outcome. Method(s): We queried the NCDB from 2004-2015 for cases of anal canal SCC stage 1-3, treated with definitive doses of XRT to the pelvis with chemo. Dose escalation was defined as > 54 Gy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of increased dose and overall survival (OS). Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios for survival were used to account for indication bias. Result(s): We identified 7,792 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, with 4,269 treated to conventional doses and 3,163 treated to > 54 Gy. Patients that were older, had government or private insurance, were treated with IMRT, or at an academic center in a more recent year were less likely to get dose escalation. Increasing T and N stage were predictive of escalated dose. The use of dose escalation decreased over time, from 50% in 2005 to 30% in 2015. In contrast, IMRT use increased over that time from 2% to 63%. On multivariable analysis increasing age, higher comorbidity score, treatment at an academic center, and increasing stage corresponded to worse OS. Increased income, private insurance, IMRT use, increased distance to facility, and female gender all predicted improved OS. Multivariable analysis with propensity score included confirmed increased age, higher comorbidity score, income, distance, and gender as predictive of OS. In addition, escalated dose was found to have inferior outcome (OR: 1.10 95%CI: 1.01-1.20, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): The results of this NCDB analysis show a steady increase in the use of IMRT over time, with a corresponding decrease in dose escalation. In this study, dose escalation was shown to have inferior outcomes, although that result is likely influenced by the increasing age, stage, and comorbidity scores in that group of patients.",Excluded
1774,"Cohort study of occupational cosmic radiation dose and cancer mortality in German aircrew, 1960-2014 Objectives To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew cohort. Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

816,"Impact of age on the selection of nuclear cardiology stress protocols: The INCAPS (IAEA nuclear cardiology protocols) study BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about radiation exposure from nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), particularly among younger patients who are more prone to develop untoward effects of ionizing radiation, and hence US and European professional society guidelines recommend age as a consideration in weighing radiation risk from MPI. We aimed to determine how patient radiation doses from MPI vary across age groups in a large contemporary international cohort. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a global cross-sectional study of centers performing MPI coordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Sites provided information on each MPI study completed during a single week in March-April 2013. We compared across age groups laboratory adherence to pre-specified radiation-related best practices, radiation effective dose (ED; a whole-body measure reflecting the amount of radiation to each organ and its relative sensitivity to radiation's deleterious effects), and the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv, a target level specified in guidelines. RESULTS: Among 7911 patients undergoing MPI in 308 laboratories in 65 countries, mean ED was 10.0+/-4.5mSv with slightly higher exposure among younger age groups (trend p value<0.001). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv across age groups, or in adherence to best practices based on the median age of patients in a laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary nuclear cardiology practice, the age of the patient appears not to impact protocol selection and radiation dose, contrary to professional society guidelines.",Excluded

2748,"Pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level is a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node recurrence in addition to squamous cell carcinoma antigen following definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix BACKGROUND: To identify pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels as a risk factor for para-aortic lymph node (PALN) recurrence following concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for cervical cancer., METHODS: From March 1995 to January 2008, 188 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix were analyzed retrospectively. No patient received PALN irradiation as the initial treatment. CEA and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were measured before and after radiotherapy. PALN recurrence was detected by computer tomography (CT) scans. We analyzed the actuarial rates of PALN recurrence by using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analyses were carried out with Cox regression models. We stratified the risk groups based on the hazard ratios (HR)., RESULTS: Both pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL and SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 8.838), SCC-Ag levels >= 40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 12.551), and SCC-Ag levels of 10-40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 4.2464) were significant factors for PALN recurrence. The corresponding 5-year PALN recurrence rates were 51.5%, 84.8%, and 27.5%, respectively. The 5-year PALN recurrence rate for patients with both low (< 10 ng/mL) SCC and CEA was only 9.6%. CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL or SCC-Ag levels >= 10 ng/mL at PALN recurrence were associated with overall survival after an isolated PALN recurrence. Pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL were also associated with survival after an isolated PALN recurrence., CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment CEA >= 10 ng/mL is an additional risk factor of PALN relapse following definitive CCRT for SCC of the uterine cervix in patients with pretreatment SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL. More comprehensive examinations before CCRT and intensive follow-up schedules are suggested for early detection and salvage in patients with SCC-Ag or CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL.",Excluded
1557,"Gastroduodenal complications after concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: endoscopic findings and risk factors PURPOSE: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is useful in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but little is known about radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications following therapy. To determine risk factors, we investigated the prevalence and patterns of gastroduodenal complications following CCRT using endoscopy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Enrolled in the study were 123 patients treated with CCRT for unresectable HCC between January 1998 and December 2005. Radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were defined as radiation gastritis/duodenitis, radiation gastric/duodenal ulcer, or other gastroduodenal toxicity associated with radiation, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 3.0). Serious gastroduodenal complications were defined as events occurring within 12 months from completion of CCRT, those requiring prompt therapeutic intervention, or symptoms equivalent to Grade 3 or 4 radiation-related gastroduodenal toxicity, including nausea or vomiting, based on CTCAE 3.0., RESULTS: A month after completion of CCRT, 65 (52.8%) patients displayed endoscopic evidence of radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications. Radiation gastric and duodenal ulcers were found in 32 (26.0%) and 20 (16.3%) patients, respectively; radiation gastritis and duodenitis were found in 50 (40.7%) and 42 (34.1%) patients, respectively. Radiation-related bleeding was observed in 13 patients (10.6%). Serious gastroduodenal complications occurred in 18 patients (14.6%) and were significantly more frequent in patients with liver cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis (p=0.043). There were no radiation-related deaths., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopically detectable radiation-induced gastroduodenal complications were common in HCC following CCRT. Although serious complications were uncommon, the frequency was higher in patients with liver cirrhosis; thus, these patients should be closely monitored when receiving CCRT.

2047,"The effects of radiation and dose-fractionation on cancer and non-tumor disease development The Janus series of radiation experiments, conducted from 1970 to 1992, explored the effects of gamma and neutron radiation on animal lifespan and disease development. Data from these experiments presents an opportunity to conduct a large scale analysis of both tumor and non-tumor disease development. This work was focused on a subset of animals from the Janus series of experiments, comparing acute or fractionated exposures of gamma or neutron radiation on the hazards associated with the development of tumor and non-tumor diseases of the liver, lung, kidney or vascular system. This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system. These results highlight the complexity in the effects of radiation on the liver, lung, kidney and vascular system.",Included
2898,"Clinical impact of Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy on locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving a major branch of the portal or hepatic vein is in a locally advanced stage and remains difficult to cure. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) in locally advanced HCC (LAHCC). Method(s): The data of 11 consecutive patients with LAHCC who received C-ion RT were analyzed. The C-ion RT doses of 52.8 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) and 60.0 Gy (RBE) were delivered in 4 fractions for standard cases, and the 60.0 Gy dose was delivered in 12 fractions for close-to-gastrointestinal-tract cases. Survival and local control probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration after C-ion RT was 36.4 months. The median age at the time of registration for C-ion RT was 76 years. The median tumor size was 53 mm. The numbers of treatment-naive and recurrent HCC patients were 1 and 10, respectively. Direct invasion of the major branch of the portal vein, hepatic vein, or both portal and hepatic veins was observed in three, five, and three patients, respectively. The 3-year overall survival, local control, and progression-free survival rates were 64, 78, and 18%, respectively. No patient developed radiation-induced liver diseases or grade 3 or higher toxicities in the acute and late phases. Conclusion(s): C-ion RT showed favorable clinical outcomes with a high rate of local control and minimal toxicities in LAHCC. Our findings suggest that C-ion RT is a promising multidisciplinary treatment option in LAHCC.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
2928,"Clinical outcomes of 130 patients with primary and secondary lung tumors treated with Cyberknife robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy Authors report clinical outcomes of patients treated with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary, recurrent and metastatic lung lesions. 130 patients with 160 lesions were treated with Cyberknife SBRT, including T1-3 primary lung cancers (54%), recurrent tumors (22%) and pulmonary metastases (24%). The mean biologically equivalent dose (BED10Gy) was 151 Gy (72-180 Gy). Median prescribed dose for peripheral and central lesions was 3x20 Gy and 3x15 Gy, respectively. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and cause-specific survival (CSS) rates, early and late toxicities are reported. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors influencing local tumor control. Median follow-up time was 21 months. In univariate analysis, higher dose was associated with better LC and a cut-off value was detected at BED10Gy <= 112.5 Gy, resulting in 1-, 2-, and 3-year actuarial LC rates of 93%, vs 73%, 80% vs 61%, and 63% vs 54%, for the high and low dose groups, respectively (p = 0.0061, HR = 0.384). In multivariate analysis, metastatic origin, histological confirmation and larger Planning Target Volume (PTV) were associated with higher risk of local failure. Actuarial OS and CSS rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 85%, 74% and 62%, and 93%, 89% and 80%, respectively. Acute and late toxicities >= Gr 3 were observed in 3 (2%) and 6 patients (5%), respectively. Our favorable LC and survival rates after robotic SBRT, with low rates of severe toxicities, are coherent with the literature data in this mixed, non-selected study population.Copyright © 2017 Radiol Oncol.",Excluded
1878,"Occupational cancer in central European countries The countries of central Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, suffer from environmental and occupational health problems created during the political system in place until the late 1980s. This situation is reflected by data on workplace exposure to hazardous agents. Such data have been systematically collected in Skovakia and the Czech Republic since 1977. The data presented describe mainly the situation in the early 1990s. The number of workers exposed to risk factors at the workplace represent about 10% of the working population in Slovakia and 30% in Poland. In Slovakia in 1992 the percentage of persons exposed to chemical substances was 16.4%, to ionizing radiation 4.3%, and to carcinogens 3.3% of all workers exposed to risk factors. The total number of persons exposed to substances proven to be carcinogens in Poland was 1.3% of the employees; 2.2% were exposed to the suspected carcinogens. The incidence of all certified occupational diseases in the Slovak Republic was 53 per 100,000 insured employees in 1992. Cancers certified as occupational cancers are skin cancer caused by occupational exposure to carcinogens, lung cancer caused by ionizing radiation, and asbestosis together with lung cancer. Specific information on occupational cancers from Romania and Bulgaria was not available for this paper. It is difficult to predict a trend for future incidences of occupational cancer. Improved control technology, governmental regulatory activity to reduce exposure, surveillance of diseases and risk factors, and vigilant use of preventive measures should, however, ultimately reduce occupational cancer.",Excluded

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to report our results of collected patient outcomes from a single center's large experience using HBOT to treat maxillary bone ORN. Method(s): From 1999 to 2015, 21 patients received treatment for maxillary bone ORN at our center. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for the following variables: age, sex, comorbidities, tumor stage and site, previous surgery, previous radiotherapy or chemoradiation therapy, HBOT data, response to treatment and further management. Result(s): A positive clinical outcome from HBOT occurred in 85.7% of patients with ORN and was proven radiologically in 14 of 15 patients (93.3%). In 5 patients, reconstructive surgery was required thereafter. Conclusion(s): Controversy exists regarding the management of ORN of the maxillofacial skeleton.

439,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
3111,"Three-dimensional scanless holographic optogenetics with temporal focusing (3D-SHOT) Optical methods capable of manipulating neural activity with cellular resolution and millisecond precision in three dimensions will accelerate the pace of neuroscience research. Existing approaches for targeting individual neurons, however, fall short of these requirements. Here we present a new multiphoton photo-excitation method, termed three-dimensional scanless holographic optogenetics with temporal focusing (3D-SHOT), which allows precise, simultaneous photo-activation of arbitrary sets of neurons anywhere within the addressable volume of a microscope. This technique uses point-cloud holography to place multiple copies of a temporally focused disc matching the dimensions of a neuron's cell body. Experiments in cultured cells, brain slices, and in living mice demonstrate single-neuron spatial resolution even when optically targeting randomly distributed groups of neurons in 3D. This approach opens new avenues for mapping and manipulating neural circuits, allowing a real-time, cellular resolution interface to the brain.",Excluded
858,"The effect of anatomical modeling on space radiation dose estimates: A comparison of doses for NASA phantoms and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile male and female astronauts The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model-normalized measurements of the radiation fields encountered in space. To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self-shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and effective doses for five commonly evaluated space radiation environments. It is found that dosimetric differences among the phantoms are greatest for soft radiation spectra and light vehicular shielding. 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded

Image data were statistically reviewed focusing on original image quality demonstrated by image-quality scores and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios; and perfusion parameters including perfusion (PF, in ml/min/ml), peak enhanced density (PED, in HU), time to peak (TTP, in seconds) and blood volume (BV, in ml/100 g) for the tumour. To test the interobserver agreement of perfusion measurements, perfusion analyses were repeatedly performed., RESULTS: Original image-quality scores were 4.71+/-0.49 whereas S/N ratios were 5.21+/-2.05, and the scores were correlated with the S/N ratios (r=0.465, p<0.0001). Mean values for PF, PED, TTP and BV of the tumour were 33.27+/-24.15 ml/min/ml, 24.06+/-9.87 HU, 29.42+/-8.61 s, and 12.45+/-12.22 ml/100 g, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficient between the replicated measurements of each perfusion parameter was greater than 0.99, and mean difference of the replicated measurements of each parameter was close to zero., CONCLUSION: Whole tumour first-pass perfusion with 64-section MDCT at low-dose radiation could be reproducible to assess microcirculation in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma without compromising subjective original image quality of the tumour.

1406,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere? Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included
3159,"Challenges in the re-irradiation of locally advanced head and neck cancers: outcomes and toxicities Purpose: To retrospectively review outcomes and toxicities for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing re-irradiation (re-RT). Method(s): Retrospective review of oncologic outcomes and toxicity data from patients who received head and neck (HN) re-RT with curative intent using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from 2011 to 2016. Common toxicities were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4. Treatment outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-one patients with HNC were re-irradiated with curative intent. The median follow-up after re-RT was 27.8 months. The median retreatment dose was 66 Gy (range, 60-70), and the median retreatment volume was 194.1 cm3 (range, 52.4-1375.6). The median LRC, PFS, and OS were 10 months, 8.4 months, and 18.1 months, respectively. Patients treated with surgery as a component of primary HN cancer treatment had significantly worse PFS and OS when retreated compared with those initially treated with chemoradiation alone (p = 0.026 and p = 0.005, respectively). Those with stage IVA/B recurrent disease had worse LRC, PFS, and OS compared with stage II/III disease (p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.020 respectively). Acute grade >= 3 toxicity and late grade >= 3 toxicity were 38% and 38%, respectively, with dysphagia being most common (24% acute and 14% late). Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with IMRT for locally advanced HN recurrences either definitively or after salvage surgery is feasible, but treatment-related toxicity remains significant. Patients who received surgery as a component of their initial treatment and those with more advanced stage disease may be more difficult to salvage with re-irradiation.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

Materials: The medical charts of 17 patients with paranasal or nasal cavity malignancies treated by robotic radiosurgery (RRS)+/- external beam radiotherapy were assessed in this retrospective study. Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions). Those 2 patients had also serious ipsilate ral facial pain requiring narcotic analgesics, and they also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with no need of surgical debridement. No visual acuity loss was observed during follow-up. Minor bleeding, which was spontaneously stopped, was seen in one patient. Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgery seems to be an alternative and tolerable therapeutic option either in recurrent or primary paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies. However, longer follow-up periods are required to see the safety of RRS particulary in terms of late effects.",Excluded
3342,"177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor and a single functioning kidney: Tolerability and effect on renal function Our objective was to assess the renal toxicity profile of 177Lu- DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and a single functioning kidney. Method(s): This was a retrospective analysis of NET patients who had undergone 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT at a large tertiary-care center. All patients selected for the study had somatostatin receptor-positive NETs, had received at least 3 cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, and had a documented single functioning kidney. The analyzed parameters included patient characteristics, metastatic burden, renal characteristics at diagnosis and during therapy, and nephrotoxic factors. For the renal assessment, the following characteristics were studied before each PRRT cycle: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as estimated by 99mTcdiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid renography, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) as measured by 99mTc-ethylenedicysteine renography, and blood urea and serum creatinine levels. Renal toxicity was evaluated using version 4.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE score). The percentage reduction in GFR and ERPF was also assessed. Filtration fraction was calculated to clarify whether there was a relatively greater reduction in one index of renal function than in the other. Result(s): At the time of analysis, 6 patients met the inclusion criteria, having received between 3 and 5 cycles of therapy with a cumulative activity of 16.6-36.2 GBq. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 to 56 mo. The overall toxicity profile (as per the NCI-CTCAE score) showed no acute renal toxicity in any patient. Regarding overall chronic renal toxicity, 3 patients had none, 1 patient had grade II, and 2 patients had grade I. All patients with overall chronic renal toxicity showed compromised renal function at the outset (baseline). The 2 patients with grade I chronic renal toxicity after PRRT had grade II at baseline and gradual improvement over the subsequent cycles. One patient with grade II at baseline showed transient worsening to grade III after the first cycle followed by gradual improvement and a return to baseline after the second cycle. Only 2 patients showed a reduction in GFR (5.3% in one and 13.84% in the other). Four patients showed a reduction in ERPF (31.4% in the patient with the greatest reduction), and all had a rise in filtration fraction signifying that tubular parameters were more affected than glomerular parameters. Conclusion(s): With proper renal protection and dose fractionation, it is feasible to use 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with NET and a single functioning kidney. Further studies are required to assess the long-term renal consequences of changes in ERPF and filtration fraction in these patients.Copyright © 2016 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
99,"Splinting the degenerative basal joint: Custom-made or prefabricated neoprene? The purpose of this study was to compare the objective, subjective, and radiographic responses of patients with carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (CMCJ-OA) wearing a prefabricated neoprene splint (PFN), which crosses the CMCJ and metacarpophalangeal joint, with those of patients wearing a custom-made thermoplastic short opponens splint (CMT), which crosses only the CMCJ. Patients (N = 25) with first CMCJ stage I and II osteoarthritis were assigned randomly to wear either the PFN splint or the CMT splint for one week. After one week, the subjects rated their function in the splint and their satisfaction and pain levels on visual analogue scales. Pinch measurements were performed and x-rays were taken to assess carpometacarpal subluxation. The second splint was then applied for one week and all measures were repeated. The subjects rated the PFN splint significantly higher, and most reported that they would choose the PFN splint over the CMT splint for daily and long-term use. Both pain and function were improved with splinting, but the effect was amplified with the PFN splint compared with the CMT splint. Both splints reduced subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint, but the CMT effect was greater. This study further supports current evidence that subjects with stage I and II first CMCJ-OA will have pain relief with thumb splinting. In addition, the PFN splint will provide greater relief when compared with the CMT splint. Furthermore, this study reveals that patients prefer the PFN splint to the CMT splint.",Excluded
2169,"Supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis for a patient with breast lymphedema secondary to breast cancer treatment Breast lymphedema (BLE) has been reported as a complication following breast cancer treatment. As for extremity lymphedema treatment, supermicrosurgical lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is considered an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments, but no case has been reported so far. We report the first case of BLE successfully treated with supermicrosurgical LVA. A 55-year-old female presented with left BLE after breast conserving surgery and axillary lymph node dissection and adjuvant radiotherapy. After the cancer treatments, the patient suffered from pronounced swelling, sensation of tension, and pain of the left breast with frequent episodes of breast cellulitis. Conservative treatments had been performed for 7 years, but were not effective, and the patient was referred for further surgical treatment. Supermicrosurgical LVA was performed at the left breast. LVA surgery resulted in three anastomoses, in which three lymphatic vessels were anastomosed to three nearby veins in an intima-to-intima coaptation manner. After LVA, the left breast decreased in size, and the sensation of tension disappeared. One year postoperatively, the patient had no distress nor cellulitis episode, and was satisfied with the results of normal breast conditions. Although further clinical studies are required to confirm efficacy, supermicrosurgical LVA has the potential to be an option for the treatment of progressive BLE refractory to conservative treatments.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Information on LA volume is available on contrast-enhanced electrocardiogram (EGC)-gated multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scans., OBJECTIVE: To assess interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility of 3-dimensional threshold-based volume (3DTV) and 2-dimensional (2D) measurements for the assessment of LA volumes with contrast-enhanced cardiac 64-slice MDCT., METHODS: Contrast-enhanced 64-slice MDCT (0.6-mm slice thickness, 120 kVp, 850 mAseff) was performed in 96 consecutive subjects (mean age 52 years; 48% women) as a subset of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computer Assisted Tomography trial. Two observers independently measured maximal (LAV(max)) and minimal (LAV(min)) LA volumes with (1) a modified Simpson's method (3DTV) based on delineation of LA areas in axial slices and (2) estimated LA volumes typically used in 2D echocardiography (area length and prolate ellipse). Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility for each method as well as correlations between the methods were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver (n = 96) and intraobserver (n = 20) variability was significantly lower for 3DTV (8%) than for area length (13%; P < 0.001) or prolate ellipse (16%; P < 0.001). 2D-based measurements rendered significantly lower LA volumes than did 3DTV (area length: -17% and -22%; prolate ellipse: -43% and -46% for LAV(max) and LAV(min), respectively; P < 0.001 for all). By 3DTV, mean LA volume was 90.4 +/- 24.5 mL for LAV(max) and 52.5 +/- 17.6 mL for LAV(min)., CONCLUSION: ECG-gated contrast-enhanced cardiac MDCT offers volumetric assessment of LA volume with excellent reproducibility without additional contrast administration or radiation exposure. 3D measures of LA volume are more reproducible and render larger volumes than 2D-derived estimates, typically used in echocardiography.",Excluded

Two radiologists assessed independently image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence., RESULTS: The radiation dose decreased significantly using Liver DRI compared to standard automatic exposure control on the total scan length, lung, breast and pelvis area, with a significant CTDIvol reduction of 27% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002), 24% (P=0.0002) and 31% (P=0.0001), respectively; and a significant SSDE reduction of 23% (P=0.0001), 28% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002) and 29% (P=0.0001), respectively. No significant SNR reductions were observed in all measured tissues at the level of the aortic arch, celiac trunk and iliac bifurcation, except in the muscle (P=0.0013) and fat tissue (P=0.0052) at the level of the ureteral meatus. No significant differences were noted between both protocols in overall image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence with an excellent inter observer agreement between radiologists (Kappa values of 0.83, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Liver DRI organ based dose modulation technique allows significant dose reduction compared to standard automatic exposure control while preserving diagnostic image quality in all thoraco-abdominopelvic areas.

723,"Preliminary experience of CyberKnife treatment of primary non-small cell lung cancer Objective: Provide the effectiveness of treatment protocol, radiotherapy plan, technique, and early clinical results of inoperable primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients who received CyberKnife treatment at Ramathibodi Hospital. Material(s) and Method(s): Six cases of inoperable primary NSCLC patients were evaluated for tumor response after having received CyberKnife treatment. The prescribed radiation dose was 45 gray (Gy) in three consecutive fractions for peripherally located tumor and 50 Gy in five fractions within two weeks for centrally located tumor (biological equivalent dose, BED, 112.5 Gy10, and 100 Gy10, respectively). The response to treatment was evaluated from roentgenographic study during follow-up period along with clinical outcome and adverse event. Result(s): Overall response after the treatment was demonstrated in five cases with roentgenographic complete response (CR, disappearance of tumor) and partial response (PR, 50% decrease in size) in two and three cases, respectively without any severe adverse event. The treatment planning parameters demonstrated the effectiveness of radiation dose homogeneity and conformity coverage of the target volume. Conclusion(s): This preliminary report has provided the effectiveness of treatment plan and local tumor controlled without severe adverse event for primary inoperable NSCLC patients receiving CyberKnife treatment.",Excluded
15,"Radioembolization of symptomatic, unresectable neuroendocrine hepatic metastases using yttrium-90 microspheres PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, efficacy, and symptom-control of radioembolization in patients with unresectable liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETLMs)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age of 62 years) with treatment-refractory NETLMs underwent radioembolization using yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres. Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded
1665,"Phase I study of involved-field radiotherapy preceding autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with high-risk lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease PURPOSE: This Phase I study was designed to evaluate the tolerability of involved-field radiotherapy (IFRT) to areas of persistent disease in patients with high-risk Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with primary refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's disease (n = 13) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 18) were treated with IFRT followed by high-dose chemotherapy and ASCT. All patients had bulky disease (> or =5 cm) and/or an inadequate response to salvage chemotherapy. The IFRT dose was escalated to a maximum of 36 Gy. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity (life-threatening/fatal toxicity occurring within 28 days of ASCT). The chemotherapy regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carmustine., RESULTS: The delivered dose of IFRT was 20 Gy in 9 patients, 28-30 Gy in 20, and 32-36 Gy in 2 patients to mediastinal (n = 19) and nonmediastinal (n = 12) sites. The median interval between IFRT completion and ASCT was 19 days. One patient developed Bearman Grade 3 hepatic toxicity. No other Grade 3 or 4 Bearman toxicity was observed. An increased requirement for i.v. narcotics was observed in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT vs. nonmediastinal IFRT (p = 0.02). A trend toward increased mucositis severity was seen in patients previously treated with a larger number of chemotherapy agents (p = 0.09) and in those with a shorter interval between IFRT and ASCT (p = 0.12). Pulmonary toxicity was more common in patients treated with mediastinal IFRT than in those treated with nonmediastinal IFRT (21% vs. 0%, p = 0.13). The 2-year overall and progression-free survival rate was 70% and 49% for all patients, 84% and 50% for patients with Hodgkin's disease, and 59% and 47% for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively., CONCLUSION: The maximal tolerated dose of IFRT was not reached when Grade 3-4 Bearman toxicity was dose limiting. Increased pulmonary toxicity and mucositis severity was seen after mediastinal IFRT compared with nonmediastinal IFRT. Because local control was excellent, higher doses of IFRT are not recommended. The absolute benefit of IFRT in this patient population needs investigation in future studies.",Excluded
2199,"Combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of bladder cancer Introduction: Superficial bladder cancer (SBC) tends to recur (30 80%) after transurethral resection (TUR) of the bladder wall. The aim of the study was a comparative analysis of efficacy of standard TUR and combined use of TUR and laser ablation in the treatment of patients with SBC. Material(s) and Method(s): 60 patients (male 41, female 19) with SBC were treated in the urological clinic of Saratov State Medical University. The age of the patients varied between 43 and 80 years (mean 60.7+/-0.5). The primary bladder tumor was registered in 47 patients, 13 patients were hospitalized due to relapse of a disease. In clinical and morphological investigations transitional cell carcinoma in the stage Ta T1N0M0G1 2 was diagnosed. All patients were divided into two groups. In 23 patients of the first group, standard TUR was applied with use of KARL STORZ Endoscope. In the second group, TUR was combined with consecutive noncontact irradiation of the tumor bed and adjacent area (1 cm2) by the light of Nd:YAG laser (""Sharplan"", lambda 1,064 nm, power 65W, total energy 20-40 kJ). Result(s): In the first group, 6 patients had relapse of the bladder cancer during the first year, and total number of patients with relapse was 7 (30.4% cases). Accordingly three years recurrence free survival rate was 69.6% in the first group. In the second group, relapse rate was only 10.8% and three years recurrence free period was 89.2%. Difference between the groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Combined use of TUR and laser ablation improves the results of the surgical treatment of the patients with SBC.",Excluded
2676,"Effect of proton-pump inhibitors on the risk of lower gastrointestinal bleeding associated with NSAIDs, aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) on lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and of their interactions with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin on LGIB risk., METHODS: We prospectively studied 355 patients emergently hospitalized for LGIB and 8,221 nonbleeding patients. All patients underwent colonoscopy. Smoking, alcohol drinking, drug exposure, and the Charlson comorbidity index score were assessed before colonoscopy. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of LGIB were estimated., RESULTS: LGIB was significantly associated with older age, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin use. PPI use was significantly associated with older age, male sex, being a current alcohol drinker, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, acetaminophen, or corticosteroid use. Multivariate analysis adjusted by the confounding factors revealed LGIB was not significantly associated with PPI use (AOR 0.87; 95 % confidence interval 0.68-1.13; p = 0.311), or specifically with omeprazole (AOR 1.18; p = 0.408), esomeprazole (AOR 0.76; p = 0.432), lansoprazole (AOR 0.93; p = 0.669), or rabeprazole (AOR 0.63; p = 0.140).

2760,"Laboratory longevity and competitiveness of Dacus ciliatus Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae) following sub-sterilizing gamma irradiation The effect of a sub-sterilizing gamma radiation dose on Dacus ciliatus adults was investigated to assess the suitability of the sterile insect technique (SIT) as an alternative method to control this pest. Late pupae (48 h prior to adult emergence) from a laboratory strain were irradiated with 120 Gy of gamma rays emitted by a 60Co source. Following adult emergence, the mortality of irradiated and non-irradiated cohorts was recorded. Over a period of 50 days after emergence, no significant negative effects of irradiation upon the longevity of male or female laboratory flies were observed. A laboratory competitiveness study (Fried test), using irradiated laboratory and wild males at a ratio of 3:1 was conducted to assess the ability of irradiated males to reduce the egg hatch rates of a wild population. The overall competitiveness was found to be ca. 0.32, suggesting a reduced, but satisfactory, quality of irradiated laboratory as compared with wild males.

687,"The use of a fully integrated electronic medical record to minimize cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from CT scanning to detect urinary tract calculi In order to determine the effects of implementation of an electronic medical record on rates of repeat computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED) setting, we analyzed the utilization of CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB) for the detection of urinary tract calculi for periods before and after the implementation of a hospital-wide electronic medical record system. Rates of repeat CT scanning within a 6-month period of previous scan were determined pre- and post-implementation and compared. Prior to implementation, there was a 6-month repeat rate of 6.2 % compared with the post-implementation period, which was associated with a 6-month repeat rate of 4.1 %. Statistical analysis using a two-sample, one-tailed t test for difference of means was associated with a p value of 0.00007. This indicates that the implementation of the electronic medical record system was associated with a 34 % decrease in 6-month repeat CT KUB scans. We conclude that the use of an electronic medical record can be associated with a decrease in utilization of unnecessary repeat CT imaging, leading to decreased cumulative lifetime risk for cancer in these patients and more efficient utilization of ED and radiologic resources. © 2013 Am Soc Emergency Radiol.",Excluded
2511,"Proton beam therapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Practice patterns, outcomes, and the effect of biologically effective dose escalation Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) generally are safe and effective for non-operative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, data comparing the two modalities are limited. We aimed to identify the practice patterns and outcomes of nonsurgical HCC cases treated definitively with either SBRT or PBT. Method(s): We queried the National Cancer Database for T1-2N0 HCC patients receiving PBT or SBRT from 2004 to 2015. Patients were excluded for any treatment other than non-palliative external beam radiotherapy. A multivariable binomial regression model identified patterns of SBRT/PBT use, and propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression assessed correlates of survival. Result(s): A total of 71 patients received PBT and 918 patients received SBRT (median follow-up 45 months). SBRT was used in 1.8% of nonoperative early stage HCC cases in 2004 and 4.2% of cases in 2015, whereas PBT was used in 0.1-0.2% of cases every year. The median biologically effective dose (BED) for SBRT and PBT was 100 Gy10 and 98 Gy10, respectively (OR =0.70, P=0.17). Factors predictive of receiving PBT included: white race, higher comorbidity score, higher education, metropolitan residence, tumors >5 cm and recent treatment (all P<0.05). Both PBT (HR =0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78) and BED >=100 Gy10 (HR =0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) were independent predictors for longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although not implying causation and requiring prospective corroboration, PBT was independently associated with longer survival than SBRT, despite being delivered to HCC patients with multiple poor prognostic factors. PBT may also allow for safer BED escalation, which also independently associated with outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
486,"Classification of benign and malignant breast lesions in ultrasound images using support vector machines One of the most common diseases prevalent among women is Breast cancer. In general, Mammography is applied for the detection of the breast cancer, whereas, the technique of Mammography makes use of the ionizing radiation. As a result, this technique does not detect the breast cancer in women having dense breast. In the beginning phases of malignancy, radiologist could experience the challenges in identifying the lesions. Hence, there is a need for one more screen test for the confirmation of the cancer. On the other hand, Sonography is also commonly used for the detection and classification of abnormalities of the breast owing to its cost-effectiveness, comfort level of patient, and non-ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, ultrasound images seem to be low contrast images as well as the physician could encounter the possible challenges in the identification of the lesions. Therefore, there has been an inevitable requirement in the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for the purpose of classifying breast lesion in an accurate manner. This paper aims at the analyzing the Morphological and Fractal features in an effective manner for differentiating benign as well as malignant masses from ultrasound images.

74,"The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the gamma-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p(66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included
585,"Delineating chromosomal breakpoints in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancer Recurrent translocations are well known hallmarks of many human solid tumors and hematological disorders, where patient- and breakpoint-specific information may facilitate prognostication and individualized therapy. In thyroid carcinomas, the proto-oncogenes RET and NTRK1 are often found to be activated through chromosomal rearrangements. However, many sporadic tumors and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) arising in patients with a history of exposure to elevated levels of ionizing irradiation do not carry these known abnormalities. We developed a rapid scheme to screen tumor cell metaphase spreads and identify candidate genes of tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression for subsequent functional studies. Using a series of overnight fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with pools comprised of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, it now becomes possible to rapidly refine breakpoint maps and, within one week, progress from the low resolution Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) maps or Giemsa-banding (G-banding) karyotypes to fully integrated, high resolution physical maps including a list of candiate genes in the critical regions. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

465,"Lack of correlation between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included

The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded

The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were <4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses <26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia., CONCLUSION: The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years.",Excluded

3036,"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.Copyright ©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

Treatment options include surgery, radiotherapy (RT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and observation. This article briefly reviews our 45-year institutional experience treating this neoplasm with RT., METHODS: From January 1968 through March 2011, 131 patients with 156 benign paragangliomas of the temporal bone, carotid body, jugular bulb, or glomus vagale were treated with RT at a median dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. The mean and median follow-up times were 11.5 years and 8.7 years, respectively., RESULTS: Five tumors (3.2%) recurred locally after RT, all within 10 years of treatment. The overall local control rates at 5 and 10 years were 99% and 96%, respectively. The cause-specific survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 98% and 97%, respectively. The distant-metastasis free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 99% and 99%, respectively. The overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 91% and 72%, respectively. There were no severe complications., CONCLUSION: RT for benign head and neck paragangliomas is a safe and efficacious treatment associated with minimal morbidity. Surgery is reserved for patients in good health whose risk of associated morbidity is low. SRS may be suitable for patients with skull base tumors <3 cm where RT is logistically unsuitable. Observation is a reasonable option for asymptomatic patients with a limited life expectancy.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2494,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the p53 pathway A cell culture assay has been developed that detects and validates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that populate the p53 pathway. One hundred thirteen EBV-transformed human B-lymphocyte cell lines obtained from a diverse population were employed to measure the apoptotic response to gamma radiation. Each cell line undergoes a reproducible, characteristic frequency of apoptosis, and the response of the population forms a normal distribution around a median of 35.5% apoptosis with a range from 12% to 58% apoptosis. Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and Perp genes significantly affect the frequency of apoptosis. The assay can detect both racial and sexual dimorphisms in these genes and has the ability to demonstrate epistatic relationships within the p53 pathway. The cell lines used in this assay provide biological materials to explore the molecular basis of the polymorphisms.Copyright © 2005 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",Included
2037,"Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome in mice after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation: Association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome and acute graft-versus-host disease Objective: To explore the association between idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Method(s): Established acute GVHD model of C57BL/6 -> BALB/c mice. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans were dynamically performed in recipient mice after transplant. Lung histopathology and cytokine levels (including TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were examined in three experimental groups: mice receiving simple irradiation, syngeneic transplants, and allogeneic transplants. Result(s): All allogeneic transplant mice developed aGVHD. On CT, most aGVHD mice had bilateral diffuse lung infiltrates, while syngeneic transplant mice had normal lungs. On histopathology, aGVHD mice had acute pneumonitis. On immunohistochemistry, the infiltrates were mainly CD4+ T cells during aGVHD onset, but CD8+ T cells predominated during aGVHD progression. Lung TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels were higher in the three experimental groups than in normal controls on days + 3 and + 7 post-transplant. On day + 7, TNF-alpha levels were higher in allogeneic than in syngeneic transplant mice; IFN-gamma levels were not different. On days + 12 and + 16, TNF-alpha levels were higher but IFN-gamma levels were lower in allogeneic mice than in syngeneic transplant mice. Conclusion(s): The underlying cause of IPS is aGVHD. T cells and TNF-alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of aGVHD-induced IPS. IPS progression may be associated with decreasing lung IFN-gamma levels. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
318,"Prospective Pilot Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Purpose: With the improvement concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), distant failures have become a more relevant problem in terms of survival. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation after primary CCRT for patients with HNSCC. Methods and Materials: Patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on Days 1, 22, and 43. Concurrent radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck was given in a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 70-70.2 Gy over 7 weeks. After completion of CCRT, patients without evidence of disease progression received an additional four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Result(s): Of 33 patients, 27 (81%) completed CCRT. After CCRT, three complete and 19 partial responses were recorded, giving an overall response rate of 67%. Of 19 patients who went to the consolidation phase, only 4 (21%) received all four cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin. Causes of failure of consolidation chemotherapy were toxicity in 11 patients, including three treatment-related deaths, and progression in 4 patients. Three patients died of sepsis during the consolidation phase. Median survival was 11 months for all patients and 8 months for those treated with consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The poor compliance and high incidence of severe toxicities prompted no further evaluation of this consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

600,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE. In 1 case, presenting C7 ABC, an Halo Vest was necessary for 30 days, being substituted by a Minerva plaster for three months. 19 patient on 20 are classified as NED (no evidence of disease) at the last F.U. 1 patient as AWD (alive with disease). Discussione e conclusioni: ABC is a benign lesion but in some cases can be locally aggressive causing pain, loss of function, spinal cord, nerve roots or cauda equina compression and pathological fractures. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) was used first as adjuvant procedure to reduce bleeding during surgery. First, De Rosa in 1990 treated ABC using embolization only. Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded
2733,"Parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: preserved parotid function after IMRT on quantitative salivary scintigraphy, and comparison with historical data after conventional radiotherapy PURPOSE: To evaluate the parotid function after parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2003 to May 2004, 16 patients with nonmetastatic NPC underwent parotid-sparing IMRT. Eight of these patients had Stage III or IV NPC based on the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. The post-IMRT parotid function was evaluated by quantitative salivary scintigraphy and represented by the maximal excretion ratio (MER) of the parotid gland after sialogogue stimulation. The parotid function of 16 NPC patients who were previously treated with conventional radiotherapy was reviewed as the historical control., RESULTS: In the parotid-sparing IMRT group, all 16 patients were alive and without cancer at the end of follow-up period (median, 24.2 months). The mean parotid MER was 53.5% before radiotherapy, 10.7% at 1 month post-IMRT, and 23.3% at 9 months post-IMRT. In the conventional radiotherapy group, the mean parotid MER was 0.6% at 6 to 12 months postradiotherapy. The difference was statistically significant (23.3% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In the IMRT group, the mean parotid doses ranged from 33.2 Gy to 58.8 Gy (average, 43.9 Gy). The correlation between the mean parotid dose and the percentage decrease of parotid MER at 9 months post-IMRT (dMER) was statically significant (p=0.008, Pearson correlation)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean parotid doses are relatively high, the significant preservation of parotid function is achieved with IMRT for NPC patients. The significant correlation between mean parotid dose and parotid dMER demonstrates the dose-function relationship of the parotid gland.",Excluded
1473,"A double-blind randomised controlled trial of a natural oil-based emulsion (Moogoo Udder Cream R) containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for managing radiation-induced skin reactions in patients with cancer BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced skin reaction (RISR) is one of the most common and distressing side effects of radiotherapy in patients with cancer. It is featured with swelling, redness, itching, pain, breaks in skin, discomfort, and a burning sensation. There is a lack of convincing evidence supporting any single practice in the prevention or management of RISR., METHODS/DESIGNS: This double-blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin (as known as Moogoo Udder Cream R) versus aqueous cream in reducing RISR, improving pain, itching and quality of life in this patient group. One group will receive Moogoo Udder Cream R. Another group will receive aqueous cream. Outcome measures will be collected using patient self-administered questionnaire, interviewer administered questionnaire and clinician assessment at commencement of radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Despite advances of radiologic advances and supportive care, RISR are still not well managed. There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream R may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim. This paper presents the design of a double blind randomised controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of Moogoo Udder Cream R versus aqueous cream for managing in RISR in patients with cancer., TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN 12612000568819.",Excluded

Romania is a region with high prevalence of HTLV-1 infection and ATLL and with low median age at diagnosis for aggressive types. We performed a retrospective analysis of post-transplant outcome in the first Romanian patients with ATLL receiving hematopoietic stem cell allotransplant. The study population included eight patients (three males, five females), with median age of 39.5 (range 26-57), with acute (one case) and lymphoma type (seven cases) that received peripheral stem cells (PBSC) from matched related (MRD) and unrelated donors (MUD) after reduced intensity conditioning. Graft versus host disease (GVHD) developed in six patients. Relapse occurred in four cases (50%) at a median time of 5-months post-transplant. Six patients died: four cases with disease-related deaths and two patients with GVHD-related deaths. The median survival post-transplant was 19.5 months (range 2.3-44.2 months). The post-transplant survival at 1-year was 62.5%, at 2-years 50%, and at 3-years 37.5%. In our opinion allogeneic transplant improves outcome in aggressive type ATLL.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

339,"Prediction of survival by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy: results of the ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 trial In this prospective National Cancer Institute-funded American College of Radiology Imaging Network/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cooperative group trial, we hypothesized that standardized uptake value (SUV) on post-treatment [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) correlates with survival in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded

1866,"Comparison of phototherapy two times and four times a week with low doses of narrow-band ultraviolet B in Asian patients with psoriasis Background/Aims: The optimum narrow-band (TL-01) ultraviolet (UV) B weekly treatment frequency for psoriasis has yet to be defined, especially in Asian patients with TL-01. Our purpose was to compare 2x weekly and 4x weekly therapy with narrow-band UVB at low doses for psoriasis vulgaris. Method(s): Sixty-nine patients with moderately severe psoriasis were recruited and allocated to the 2x weekly or 4x weekly treatment group. The patients were treated with a new protocol using low doses of narrow-band UVB with varied exposure increments. Outcomes were evaluated by means of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores, time (weeks), cumulative UVB dose and number of treatments to clearance. Result(s): No significant difference was found between the two regimens in the PASI score at the end of treatment, in the proportion of patients whose skin cleared during treatment and in the time to clearance (8 weeks). Those who completed treatment achieved clearance after a median of 16 exposures with 2x weekly treatment compared with 32 exposures with 4x weekly treatment (P=0.0304), and 12.5 minimal erythema dose multiples (MEDs) compared with 39.7 MEDs (P=0.0470). Acute side effects of the treatment were similar for the two groups (P=0.8462). Conclusion(s): For skin phototype III-V populations, a greater long-term risk is expected, connected with the higher cumulative UVB dose and number of exposures required in the 4x weekly group. Therefore, 4x weekly phototherapy will no longer be used for psoriasis.",Excluded

In this paper we tested the efficacy of four common NTCP models applied quantitatively to sub-clinical X-ray computed tomography (CT)-density changes in the lung following radiotherapy. Radiotherapy planning datasets and follow-up chest CTs were obtained in eight patients treated for targets within the lung or hilar region. Image pixel-wise radiation dose exposure versus change in observable CT Hounsfield units was recorded for early (2-5 months) and late (6-9 months) time-points. Four NTCP models, Lyman, Logistic, Weibull and Poisson, were fit to the population data. The quality of fits was assessed by five statistical criteria. All four models fit the data significantly (p<0.05) well at early, late and cumulative time points. The Lyman model fitted best for early effects while the Weibull Model fitted best for late effects. No significant difference was found between the fits of the models and with respect to parameters D50 and gamma50. The D50 estimates were more robust than gamma50 to image registration error. For analyzing population-based sub-clinical CT pixel intensity-based dose response, all four models performed well.",Excluded

Quantitative parameters (image noise and contrast-to-noise ratios [CNRs]) and qualitative visual parameters (image noise, small structures, organ enhancement, and overall image quality) were compared., RESULTS: Monochromatic images at 50 keV and 60 keV provided similar or lower image noise, but higher contrast and overall image quality as compared with 120-kVp images. Despite the higher image noise, 40-keV images showed similar overall image quality compared to 120-kVp images. Radiation dose did not differ between the two protocols, while contrast agent dose in protocol B was reduced by 33 %., CONCLUSION: Application of ASIR and ASIS to monochromatic imaging from 40 to 60 keV allowed contrast agent dose reduction with adequate image quality and without increasing radiation dose compared to 120 kVp with FBP., KEY POINTS: * Automatic spectral imaging protocol selection provides appropriate scan protocols. * Abdominal CT is feasible using spectral imaging and 300 mgI/kg contrast agent. * 50-keV monochromatic images with 50 % ASIR provide optimal image quality.",Excluded

In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification., RESULTS: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 +/- 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 +/- 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 +/- 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 +/- 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.",Excluded
648,"The effect of oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and high-dose proton pump inhibitors on the histology of Barrett's esophagus Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Bile composition can be influenced by oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We prospectively investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) supplemented with UDCA in vivo in patients with BE. Patients with no or low-grade dysplasia who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI were eligible for the study. In order to exclude the effects of acid reflux, all patients were initially treated with 40 mg esomeprazole (ESO) twice daily for 6 months and continued on this dose till the end of the study (t = 12 months). During a period of 6 months (t = 6 month - t = 12 month) patients were treated with oral UDCA (600 mg twice daily). Patients underwent endoscopy at t = 0 months, t = 6 months and t = 12 months with multiple biopsies of the distal and proximal BE segment, normal squamous and gastric cardia. In addition, pH was measured at t = 0 months and t = 6 months using a BRAVO wireless pH capsule. Bile was sampled at the beginning of the UDCA treatment and 6 months later (t = 6 month and t = 12 month). All biopsies were reviewed for the extent of metaplasia, dysplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation. In addition, proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (villin, cytokeratins 7 and 20) and inflammation (COX-2) were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nine patients (mean age 60 years, median BE length 7 cm) were included, of whom six had no dysplasia and three had low-grade dysplasia. pH measurements revealed a normal acid exposure in most patients at t = 0 and t = 6 months. In addition, bile composition analysis demonstrated the efficacy of UDCA. Combining the results of both phases of the study, no significant changes were seen in any of the histological or IHC parameters. Differentiation and proliferation parameters showed no significant changes. In this study, in BE patients who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI, increasing the PPI dose to the maximum for 6 months followed by the addition of UDCA for 6 months did not result in significant histological or IHC changes in their BE.",Excluded
72,"Effect of oral administration of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin erythema and pigmentation induced by UVB, UVA, visible light and solar simulated radiation Hypericin from St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a photosensitizing agent that may cause a severe photodermatitis when higher amounts of St John's wort are ingested by animals. Although Hypericum extracts are widely used in the treatment of depressive disorders, only a little information on the photosensitizing capacity of St John's wort in humans is available. In the present prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of the Hypericum extract LI 160 on skin sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA), visible light (VIS) and solar simulated radiation (SIM). Seventy two volunteers of skin types II and III were included and were divided into six groups, each consisting of 12 volunteers. In the single-dose study the volunteers (n = 48) received 6 or 12 coated tablets (5400 or 10800 mug hypericin). In the steady-state study the volunteers (n = 24) received an initial dose of 6 tablets (5400 mug hypericin), and subsequently 3 x 1 tablets (2700 mug hypericin) per day for 7 days. Phototesting was performed on the volar forearms prior to medication and 6 h after the last administration of Hypericum extract. The erythema-index and melanin-index were evaluated photometrically using a mexameter. After both single-dose and steady-state administration, no significant influence on the erythema-index or melanin-index could be detected, with the exception of a marginal influence on UVB induced pigmentation (p = 0.0471) in the single-dose study. The results do not provide evidence for a phototoxic potential of the Hypericum extract LI 160 in humans when administered orally in typical clinical doses up to 1800 mg daily. This is in accordance with previous pharmacokinetics studies that found hypericin serum and skin levels after oral ingestion of Hypericum extract always to be lower than the assumed phototoxic hypericin threshold level of 1000 ng/mL.

1779,"Complex fractures of the distal humerus in the elderly: Is primary total elbow arthroplasty a valid treatment alternative? A series of 20 cases Introduction: Distal humerus fractures are fairly rare. But as our population ages, these fractures become more complex and the choice of treatment more delicate. Poor bone quality results in many technical problems and the fixation hardware stability remains at risk. The goal of this study was to evaluate the functional recovery and morbidity of complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients when treated with elbow prosthesis. Hypothesis: Good functional recovery can be achieved with a total joint replacement. Patients and Methods: This series consisted of 20 patients (18 women and two men) having an average age of 80years (range 65-93, median 80). Based on the AO classification, there were two Type A2 fractures, two Type B fractures, 15 Type C fractures and one fracture that could not be classified because of previous rheumatoid disease history at this elbow. Two fractures were open. In two cases, the olecranon was also fractured. Treatment consisted of the implantation of a Coonrad-Morrey, hinge-type total elbow prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA). The Mayo Clinic surgical approach was used 17 times and the transolecranon approach was used three times. Primary arthroplasty was performed in 19 cases and the surgery was performed after six weeks of conservative treatment (diagnostic delay) in one case. Unrestricted motion was allowed after surgery, but a maximum of 0.5kg could be carried during the first 3months; this was subsequently increased to 2.5kg. Result(s): Fifteen of the 20 patients were available for reevaluation with an average follow-up of 3.6. years (range 1.7-5.5, median 3.4). Four patients had died and one was lost to follow-up. The average range of motion was 97degree (range 60-130degree), comprising an average flexion of 130degree (range 110-140degree) and average loss of extension of 33degree (range 0-80degree). Pronation and supination were normal. The average Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was 83 (range 60-100, median 80). X-rays revealed seven cases of radiolucent lines, with two being progressive. There was no visible wear of the polyethylene bushings at the hinge. Six patients had moderate periarticular heterotopic ossification. The two cases of olecranon osteotomy and one case of olecranon fracture had healed. There were no surgical site infections but two cases of ulnar compression, one of which required neurolysis. There was one case of humeral component loosening after 6. years, but the implant was not changed. Discussion(s): The clinical range of motion results were comparable to published data. The functional scores were slightly lower, mainly because of the pain factor. The initial results were encouraging and consistent with published data as long as the indications were well-chosen. Based on this retrospective study, total elbow arthroplasty can be a valid alternative in the surgeon's treatment armamentarium for complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients who have moderate functional demands. Our results support our hypothesis, since we found good functional recovery without associated morbidity.

2421,"Accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy combined with induction and concomitant chemotherapy for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: Impact of total treatment time Tumour cell proliferation during conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) can negatively influence the treatment outcome in patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accelerated and hyperfractionated RT may therefore have an advantage over conventional RT. Moreover, earlier studies have suggested improved survival with addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). We present here the results of combined treatment with induction and concomitant CT and accelerated hyperfractionated RT in a retrospective series of patients with advanced NSCLC. Between August 1990 and August 1995, 90 consecutive patients, aged 42-77 years (median 63 years), with locally advanced unresectable or medically inoperable NSCLC and good performance status were referred for treatment: stage: I 23%, IIIa 37%, IIIb 40%. Patients histologies included: squamous cell carcinoma 52%, adenocarcinoma 34% and large cell carcinoma 13%. The treatment consisted of two courses of CT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1- 3 i.v.), the second course given concomitantly with RT. The total RT dose was 61.2-64.6 Gy, with two daily fractions of 1.7 Gy. A one-week interval was introduced after 40.8 Gy to reduce acute toxicity, making the total treatment time 4.5 weeks. Concerning toxicity, 33 patients had febrile neutropenia, 10 patients suffered from grade III oesophagitis and 7 patients had grade III pneumonitis. There were two possible treatment-related deaths, one due to myocardial infarction and the other due to a pneumocystis carinii infection. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 72%, 46% and 34%, respectively; median survival was 21.3 months. Fifty-one patients had progressive disease: 21 failed locoregionally, 29 had distant metastases and 9 patients had a combination of these. Pretreatment weight loss was the only prognostic factor found, except for stage. However, the results for stage IIIb were no different from those for stage IIIa.

To determine the tolerance doses of cutaneous and mucosal tissues of normal birds in order to provide more effective radiation treatment for tumors that have been shown to be radiation responsive in other species, ingluvial mucosa and the skin over the ingluvies of 9 ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) were irradiated in 4-Gy fractions to a total dose of either 48, 60, or 72 Gy using an isocentric cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. Minimal radiation-induced epidermal changes were present in the high-dose group histologically. Neither dose-related acute nor chronic radiation effects could be detected in any group grossly in cutaneous or mucosal tissue over a 9-month period. Radiation doses of 72 Gy in 4-Gy fractions were well tolerated in the small number of ring-necked parakeets in this initial tolerance dose study.",Included
1419,"Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy for Anal Cancer: Results From a Multi-Institutional Retrospective Cohort Study OBJECTIVES: To assess toxicity and efficacy of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for anal cancer., METHODS: Records of 152 patients were reviewed retrospectively from multiple institutions. Data on disease control and toxicity were collected as well as patient and treatment characteristics. Acute (<6 mo) and late (>=6 mo) severe toxicity (grade >=3) were graded. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of metastatic disease or stage TX. Late toxicity data were available for 120 patients., RESULTS: Median cumulative IMRT dose was 51.25 Gy (median, 28 fractions). All but 2 patients received chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 26.8 months, local control at 3 years was 87%, worse for patients with T3-T4 than T1-T2 disease on univariate analysis (79% vs. 90%; P=0.04). Regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively, at 3 years. Nodal status was associated with regional control, distant control, and overall survival (P<0.01 for each). Most common severe acute toxicity was hematologic (41%), skin (20%), and gastrointestinal tract (11%). Two grade 5 toxicities occurred (hematologic and gastrointestinal tract). Severe late toxicity affected skin (1%) and gastrointestinal tract (3%)., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with chemotherapy resulted in excellent local control. Although T stage predicted worse local control, most T3-T4 disease was controlled with IMRT. Nodal status predicted regional and distant control and overall survival. Severe toxicity was acceptable.",Excluded

Method(s): Twenty-six patients with confirmed maxillary sinus carcinoma were enrolled in this study from May 2009 to April 2011. Patients underwent proton beam therapy and intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin. Result(s): The median total dose was 70.4 GyE per 32 fractions, and the median dose of cisplatin was 300 mg/body for six cycles of intra-arterial infusion. The 3-year overall survival rate was 58% for all patients (n = 26), 58% for patients with stage T4 disease (n = 12), 57% for patients with <Stage T3 disease (n = 14), 66% for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 15) and 45% for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11). Two patients developed non-hematologic side effects such as Grade 3 radiation dermatitis, one developed osteonecrosis and one developed brain necrosis. Ocular/visual problems occurred in three patients, which included Grade 4 retinopathy and Grade 3 cataract in one and two patients, respectively. Conclusion(s): Proton beam therapy combined with cisplatin intra-arterial infusion administered via a superficial temporal artery appears to be safe and effective for maxillary sinus carcinoma.Copyright © The Author 2015.

2166,"Evolution of coronary computed tomography radiation dose reduction at a tertiary referral center Purpose: We aimed to assess the temporal change in radiation doses from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) during a 6-year period. High CCTA radiation doses have been reduced by multiple technologies that, if used appropriately, can decrease exposures significantly. Method(s): A total of 1277 examinations performed from 2005 to 2010 were included. Univariate and multivariable regression analysis of patient- and scan-related variables was performed with estimated radiation dose as the main outcome measure. Result(s): Median doses decreased by 74.8% (P <.001), from 13.1 millisieverts (mSv) (interquartile range 9.3-14.7) in period 1 to 3.3 mSv (1.8-6.7) in period 4. Factors associated with greatest dose reductions (P <.001) were all most frequently applied in period 4: axial-sequential acquisition (univariate: -8.0 mSv [-9.7 to -7.9]), high-pitch helical acquisition (univariate: -8.8 mSv [-9.3 to -7.9]), reduced tube voltage (100 vs 120 kV) (univariate: -6.4 mSv [-7.4 to -5.4]), and use of automatic exposure control (univariate: -5.3 mSv [-6.2 to -4.4]).

57,"Failure patterns relative to radiation treatment fields for stage II-IV thymoma INTRODUCTION: The optimal radiation therapy (RT) field design for thymomas remains unclear. Here we report the failure patterns in stage II-IV thymoma after RT at two tertiary referral centers, classified according to the new International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group definitions. METHOD(S): We reviewed 156 stage II-IV patients with thymoma treated with definitive (n=24) or adjuvant (n=132) RT. All RT was delivered without elective nodal irradiation (median dose 5040 cGy). Intrathoracic failures were classified as (1) in-field failures (within 100% isodose line [IDL]), (2) marginal recurrences (<100% and >=50% IDL), and (3) out-of-field failures (outside the 50% IDL). RESULT(S): The median follow-up was 61 months. Surgical margins were positive in 39%. The median tumor size was 9 cm. The 5-year cumulative incidence of all intrathoracic failures was 24% (n=34). Failures occurred within the RT field (n=5), marginally (n=1), out-of-field (n=22), and synchronously in- and out-of-field (n=6). The 5-year cumulative incidence of in-field failures was 7%. These were associated with Masaoka stage and tumor size. Macroscopically positive margins were associated with more local failures. Intrathoracic failures occurred most commonly in the pleural space (n=29) and lymph nodes (n=9). Patients with more advanced stage, and those treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy had more intrathoracic failures. RT dose and chemotherapy did not impact failure patterns. CONCLUSION(S): Although there were few in-field failures in patients who received RT for stage II-IV thymomas, a high rate of out-of-field intrathoracic failures still occurred. Further study is necessary to identify treatment approaches that prevent pleural recurrences. Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded

1422,"Scanning beyond anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT: findings, radiation dose, and automatic tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine additional radiation dose associated with scanning beyond the anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT protocol and to assess the effect of z-axis modulation on the additional radiation dose associated with the scanning protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications.

344,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included
1320,"Meteorological factors and psychiatric emergencies Introduction. Studies conducted in the psychiatric setting and related with biometeorology generally coincide that there is a seasonal rhythm between seasons and depressive disorders, violent suicides and manic episodes. However, there are many discrepancies about the correlation of specific meteorological variables with the remaining clinical pictures. This work has aimed to study a wide sample of psychiatric cases in this area (Baix Camp/Tarragona) to see whether there is a relationship between meteorological variables and the total number of daily emergencies. Method. We recorded the data of 3,048 cases attended in the Emergency Department of the Hospital Pere Mata de Reus (Tarragona) from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005. The possible relationship between the number of daily visits and different meteorological end- points (such as wind direction and speed, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and solar radiation) were analyzed statistically. Results. The results were statistically significant for the meteorological cndpoints of medium temperature (TMED), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN). The relationship between humidity and number of daily visits was also statistically significant (non-linear form). The remaining comparisons did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions. The main conclusion of our study is that there is a direct relationship between environmental temperature increase and the number of patients attended in the hospital emergency department. A relationship could also be observed in regards to humidity. This fact may suggest the need to have suitable medical attendance planning for the hottest and most humid periods.",Excluded
150,"Estimation of activity of administered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose by measurement of the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is now a routine procedure for the management of cancer patients. Intravenous administration of FDG is sometimes halted due to troubles. In such cases, estimations of the FDG dosage injected prior to halting administration may be helpful. We have established a method of estimating the activity of FDG to patients on the basis of the dose equivalent rate on the surface of the right temporal region of the head. The correlation of actual administered dosage with independent variables, such as the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head, age, sex, and body weight, was analyzed using multiple regression analysis to obtain linear, quadratic, and cubic regression equations. Result(s): When entering independent variables, the cubic regression equation could be used to estimate an administered dosage with an accuracy of +/-10 % for 62 % of all patients and +/-20 % for 90 % of all patients. Conclusion(s): We conclude that this method is useful for estimating the administered dosage from the dose equivalent rate on the temporal region of the head.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
3255,"Radiation dose optimization of a dual tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma: A Whole body ultra-low dose CT Aim/Introduction: To design an optimized dual-tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma and to retrospectively review the radiation dose received by patients who underwent this procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): In a research project carried out in our PET department, a dual-tracer PET/CT scan covering head to feet and a whole-body low dose CT (WBLDCT) were prescribed for patients with multiple myeloma. For the scope of optimization, PET/CT and WBLDCT were merged in a one-stop-shop. Thus, FDG PET/CT included a diagnostic CT (WBLDCT: 120 kV-80 mAs) while MET PET/ CT included a CT dedicated only for attenuation correction, referred as whole body ultra-low dose CT (WBULDCT: 100 kV-40 mAs). Both PET/CT scans covered the whole patient from head to feet, in supine position with the arms beside the body. Thirty-one patients with proven multiple myeloma who underwent this protocol were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data and dose parameters (doselength product, DLP) were recorded. Effective doses were calculated with CT-Expo for the CT component and with dose coefficients for the PET contribution (0.019 mSv/MBq for FDG and 0.0084 mSv/MBq for MET). Result(s): We analyzed 31 patients, 23 males and 8 females, aged 59 +/- 10 years, with BMI 27.0 +/- 3.8 kg/m2. DLP expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) was 790 (IQR: 282) mGy.cm for WBLDCT and 262 (IQR: 123) mGy.cm for WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients received a median effective dose of 6.4 (IQR: 2.0) mSv from the WBLDCT and 2.1 (IQR: 0.8) mSv from the WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients were administered 327 +/- 75 MBq of FDG and 469 +/- 50 MBq of MET. The resultant effective doses (mean +/- standard deviation) were 6.2 +/- 1.4 mSv and 3.9 +/- 0.4 mSv, respectively. Total effective dose for each PET/ CT was 12.7 +/- 3.0 mSv for FDG and 6.1 +/- 0.8 mSv for MET. Conclusion(s): In this protocol for multiple myeloma evaluation, radiation dose optimization achieved due to both, the merge of nuclear medicine and radiological examinations, and to the inclusion of a WBULDCT (with a 66.7% dose reduction respect to the WBLDCT), entailed a great benefit for the patients. An effort in reviewing each PET/CT indication could lead to the customization and optimization of protocols and to the subsequent dose reduction.",Excluded
282,"Isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis by use of 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine-treated cells Irradiated McCoy cells have provided a useful technique for the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis strains, among which are found the etiological agents of trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded

Blood flow images from all subjects were transformed to a standard anatomical space for voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis. High quality blood flow images were obtained from all but 1 subject. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant flow decreases relative to control subjects in temporal, parietal, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices. Increased severity of disease, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination, correlated with posterior parietal and posterior cingulate decreases but not temporal decreases. Arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging was found to be an effective tool for characterizing flow decreases accompanying Alzheimer's disease. The absence of ionizing radiation or injection and the ability to obtain high quality anatomical images within the same scanning session make arterial spin labeling an attractive technique for the study of Alzheimer's disease, for the evaluation of pharmacological therapies, and, possibly, for early diagnosis.",Excluded
1354,"Glaucoma incidence risk in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation Glaucoma is a major cause of visual impairment, and secondary glaucoma manifested as neovascular glaucoma has long been known to occur following high-dose fractionated radiation therapy. In contrast, little is known as to whether ionizing radiation exposure causes primary glaucoma, except that a single study in Japanese atomic bomb survivors has reported a significantly increase risk. Therefore, the effect of lower dose and lower dose rate remains unclear. Here we report that in Russian Mayak Production Association workers occupationally exposed to chronic radiation for prolonged periods, incidence of total primary glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma is significantly associated with various non-radiation factors (sex, attained age, and cataract diagnosed prior to glaucoma), but neither with cumulative dose from external gamma-rays nor with cumulative neutron dose nor with the unweighted sum of cumulative gamma and neutron doses.

North Central Cancer Treatment Group Per protocol, patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an intergroup phase II trial conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group had their cognitive functions measured using the Folstein and Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and their physical functions measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score (PS) at study entry, at each treatment evaluation, and at quarterly intervals thereafter until disease progression or death. Of the 53 eligible participants who began therapy, 46 (87%) had baseline MMSE scores recorded, 36 (68%) had at least one follow-up MMSE, and 32 (60%) had both, while 52 (98%) had baseline PS, 49 (92%) had at least one follow-up PS, and 48 (91%) had both. Patterns of MMSE and PS values over time were studied in each individual, in the group as a whole, in the 20 patients who completed the study regimen, in the 23 who survived more than a year, and in patients who were classified as nonprogressors at each key evaluation. For each patient, all recorded values were plotted versus time, with dates of disease progression and death included, to look for signs of decline in cognitive or physical function preceding adverse events. Long-term declines in scores of both cognitive and physical function were observed in many treated patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nearly all patients who were alive more than 52 weeks after study entry had a demonstrable decline in cognitive and physical functionality. Such declines may occur before disease progression is documented; they may also occur in some patients who have long-term follow-up without evidence of disease progression. Declining MMSE and PS was a poor predictor of disease progression. There was no association of PS and toxicity. The data from this study demonstrated the considerable difficulties we encountered conducting an ancillary study such as this within a multicenter clinical trial. Firstly, the test instruments written into the protocol were unable to tell if the declines seen were due to disease, treatment, co-morbidity, or other factors.

The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains. It is concluded that radiation therapy in commonly employed dosages for malignant gliomas carries a risk of injury to surrounding cerebral tissues.",Included
1698,"The small molecule drug CBL0137 increases the level of DNA damage and the efficacy of radiotherapy for glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor with inevitable recurrence. This is in part due to a highly malignant cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation of tumor cells that is particularly resistant to conventional treatments, including radiotherapy. Here we show that CBL0137, a small molecule anti-cancer agent, sensitizes GBM CSCs to radiotherapy. CBL0137 sequesters the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex to chromatin, resulting in cytotoxicity preferentially within tumor cells. We show that when combined with radiotherapy, CBL0137 inhibited GBM CSC growth and resulted in more DNA damage in the CSCs compared to irradiation or drug alone. Using an in vivo subcutaneous model, we showed that the frequency of GBM CSCs was reduced when tumors were pretreated with CBL0137 and then exposed to irradiation. Survival studies with orthotopic GBM models resulted in significantly extended survival for mice treated with combinatorial therapy. As GBM CSCs contribute to the inevitable recurrence in patients, targeting them is imperative. This work establishes a new treatment paradigm for GBM that sensitizes CSCs to irradiation and may ultimately reduce tumor recurrence.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
1659,"Suppression of voluntary motor activity revealed using transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex in man 1. Suppression of voluntary muscle activity of hand and arm muscles in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex has been investigated in man. 2. Suppression could be elicited by low levels of TMS without any prior excitatory response. The latency of the suppression was 3-8 ms longer than the excitation observed at a higher stimulus intensity. The duration of the suppression ranged from 8 to 26 ms. 3. A circular stimulating coil was used to determine threshold intensity for excitation and suppression of contraction of thenar muscles in response to TMS at different locations over the motor cortex. The locations for lowest threshold excitation coincided with those for lowest threshold suppression. Suppression was elicited at a lower threshold than excitation at all locations. 4. A figure-of-eight stimulating coil was positioned over the left motor cortex at the lowest threshold point for excitation of the right thenar muscles. The orientation for the lowest threshold excitatory and inhibitory responses was the same for all subjects. That orientation induced a stimulating current travelling in an antero-medial direction. Suppression was invariably elicited at lower thresholds than excitation. 5. When antagonistic muscles (second and third dorsal interosseus) were co-contracted, TMS evoked coincident suppression of voluntary EMG in the two muscles without prior excitation of either muscle. This suggests that the suppression is not mediated via corticospinal activation of spinal interneurones. 6. Test responses to electrical stimulation of the cervical spinal cord were evoked in both relaxed and activated thenar muscles. In the relaxed muscle, prior TMS at an intensity that would suppress voluntary activity failed to influence the test responses, suggesting absence of inhibition at a spinal level. However, in the activated muscle, prior TMS could reduce the test response. This may be explained by disfacilitation of motoneurones due to inhibition of corticospinal output. 7. We propose that suppression of voluntary muscle activity by TMS is due in large part to activation of a mechanism within the motor cortex that reduces the corticospinal output to the muscle. It is concluded that TMS evokes excitation and inhibition via neuronal structures lying close to one another and having similar orientations.",Excluded
429,"Evaluation of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D PET scanner in H2(15)O brain activation studies: dose fractionation strategies for rCBF and signal enhancing protocols We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
2502,"Low-dose radiotherapy for lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa Purpose: There is no agreement within the radiation oncology and ophthalmic communities regarding the treatment of lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. The authors report their experience with the use of low-dose radiation therapy for malignant and benign lymphoid masses of the orbital region in a series of 54 patients treated between 1985 and 1993. Method(s): All patients received 2 Gy per day for a total of 24 Gy, except when the lesion was extensive, in which case the therapy was 1.5 Gy per day for a total of 25.5 Gy. A diagnosis was established by incisional surgical biopsy in 26 patients and aspiration cytology in 28 patients. Those with a malignant or an indeterminate diagnosis were evaluated with a modified Ann Arbor staging system. Result(s): Low-dose radiation therapy produced a complete response in 100% of the orbital lymphoid lesions. This local control was maintained in 52 patients (96%) for the first year and in 51 patients (95%) for 5 or more years with a mean follow-up of 7 years. One patient died of causes unrelated to the malignant lymphoma after the first year of observation. The mean age of the 54 patients was 67 years, and the range was 37 to 90 years. The mean ages of presentation for each location were: orbit, 67 years; conjunctiva, 68 years; lacrimal gland, 66 years; and eyelids, 72 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25:1 (34 women and 20 men). In this series, 9 patients had benign processes, 38 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 patients had abnormalities of indeterminate cause. All histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the orbit responded equally well to therapy. Forty-five patients had clinically staged disease as follows: stage I, 21 patients; stage II, 4 patients; stage III, 2 patients; and stage IV, 18 patients. Benign disease, diagnosed in 9 patients, was not staged. Conclusion(s): Low-dose radiation therapy proved effective in treating lymphoid lesions of the orbital area. No treatment-limiting complications occurred.

3171,"Preprocedural evaluation and endovascular treatment of iliofemoral artery disease without contrast media for patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency Background: Generally, both the preprocedural evaluation and endovascular therapy (EVT) for lower limb arteries require contrast media that is harmful for patients with chronic renal insufficiency. In the present study these procedures were performed without using nephrotoxic contrast media in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency and iliofemoral artery disease. Methods and Results: The 36 consecutive patients with chronic renal insufficiency underwent preprocedural evaluation with duplex examination, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast media, and plain computed tomography (CT). A total of 51 lesions were treated using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) without contrast media. The overall technical success was 100% without any complications. Pre- and postprocedural ankle - brachial indices changed from 0.59+/-0.23 to 0.92+/-0.14. The mean serum creatinine concentration before and after treatment, and 3 months after treatment did not change (2.1+/-1.4, 2.0+/-1.4, and 2.1+/-1.6mg/dl, respectively). The overall 3-month survival rate and limb salvage rate was 100%. Conclusion(s): EVT comprising duplex, MRA, and CT for preprocedural evaluation and IVUS-guided procedure is feasible and may avoid intra-arterial contrast injection in selected patients deemed at high risk for renal failure from nephrotoxic contrast material.",Excluded
546,"Clinical evolution of Astra Tech implants for oral rehabilitation in reconstru ction for ablative head and neck surgery Purpose: Successful occlusal rehabilitation with implant retained prosthesis is a key step in restoring patient's functional dignity in the midst of challenges, like poor tissue quality after radiation and surgery in head and neck oncology patients. The study aimed to ascertain the success of Astra-Tech implants in this patient group. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients who were restored with Astra Tech implants after ablative head and neck surgery were evaluated by analyzing serial prospectively accrued data since April 2006. Patient's data who received implants in the mandible were selected to be evaluated regarding implant success and contributing factors. Implant survival was calcula ted by the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Stat-View Version 4.1, Abacus Concepts, Inc.) and Cox models were used to evaluate any association between implant failure and reconstructive or medical treatment modality. Result(s): A total of 136 implants were placed in 33 patients during December 2006 to April 2012. Ten of the subjects were females and 23 were males with a mean age of 65 years. 21 patients received radiotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose between 56 Gray and 76 Gray. In six patients failures were noted resulting in a loss of 17 implants. Cumulative survival rates were 92.7% after 1 year and 87.5% after years two and three. Radiation therapy contributed to 12 of the 17 implant failures (p-value < 0.3). Failures occurred more in the interforam inal than in the posterior region (11-6). Free vascularized bone grafts with two failure fared significantly better than own bone or free bone grafts (p-value < 0.344). Conclusion(s): Astra Tech implant survival is acceptably high in this at risk group of patients and compares more than favorably with comparative studies in the literature. Radiation therapy seems to be associated with implant failure and the contribution of vascular-ized tissue to the survival of implants seems to be significant.",Excluded
2847,"Indirect computed tomography venography with a low-tube-voltage technique: Reduction in the radiation and contrast material dose-A prospective randomized study Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of low-tube-voltage computed tomography (CT) venography on qualitative and quantitative image parameters and the radiation dose. Method(s): Eighty-eight studies on 84 patients underwent pelvic and lower-extremity CT venography under protocol A (standard 120 kV with 150 mL of contrast material, n = 44) or protocol B (80 kV with 100 mL of contrast material, n = 44) on a 64-detector CT scanner. We compared the dose length product in the 2 protocols. Two blinded observers measured CT attenuation in the veins, the image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio, and figure of merit. Result(s): The mean dose length product was significantly lower under protocol B than A (603.2 [SD, 67.2] vs 1131.7 [SD, 67.0] mGy x cm) (P < 0.01). Mean CT attenuation of the veins was significantly greater with protocol B (125.3 [SD, 16.2] vs 106.1 [SD, 16.0] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01), and the mean image noise was also significantly higher under protocol B (6.6 [SD, 0.8] vs 4.9 [SD, 0.7] Hounsfield units) (P < 0.01). There was no difference in contrast-to-noise ratio (P = 0.46). Figure of merit was significantly higher under protocol B (P < 0.01).

1209,"Radiation therapy for leukemia cutis Purpose: Leukemia cutis (LC) is the infiltration of the epidermis, dermis, or subcutis by neoplastic leukocytes, resulting in clinically identifiable cutaneous lesions. Electron-based radiation therapy (RT) is often used in the treatment of LC; however, modern studies of RT are lacking. We reviewed our experience to analyze treatment response, disease control, and toxicity associated with RT in order to develop treatment recommendations for patients with LC. Methods and Materials: Fifteen patients who underwent treatment for LC at our institution from November 1994 to August 2009 were identified and their medical records were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): LC presented after a median of 2 (range 0-24) months from acute myeloid leukemia diagnosis. Median survival from time of LC presentation was 23 months (range 0.5-137 months). Thirteen courses of radiation were administered to 12 patients: 9 total skin electron beam (TSEB) therapy and 4 focal treatments. Of patients receiving TSEB, 89% had diffuse LC involvement and 67% were in marrow remission. By contrast, only 25% of patients receiving focal therapy had diffuse LC involvement and only 25% were in marrow remission. Median TSEB dose was 1600 (range 600-2400) cGy. Fifty percent of patients had a complete response to RT but 1-year local control was only 33%. All patients who developed a skin relapse either had active marrow disease at the time of RT or marrow recurrence shortly thereafter. Median survival since RT was 5 (range 0.5-136) months. RT was well tolerated without significant acute effects; however, 1 patient receiving chemotherapy developed radiation recall 1 month after RT. Conclusion(s): Patients with LC have aggressive disease with few long-term survivors. Definitive treatment with TSEB should be utilized only in cases of marrow remission with focal electron therapy reserved for palliation of symptomatic lesions. Long-term prognosis and durable cutaneous remission is dependent on systemic disease control. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
1791,"Significant Correlation Between Overall Survival and Mean Lung Dose in Lung Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Background: After stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for medically inoperable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), more patients die of comorbidities, particularly severe pulmonary insufficiency, than of tumor progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate correlation between lung biologically effective dose (BED) with an alpha/beta ratio of 3 Gy (BED3) and overall survival (OS) for these patients. Method(s): From 2012 to 2017, we have developed a prospectively updated institutional database for all first 100 consecutively treated patients with inoperable Stage 1 (T1T2N0M0) NSCLC. All SBRT were conducted on a Novalis Tx LINAC with two coplanar dynamic conformal arcs (84%) or with coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) (16%). Mean GTV and PTV were 8.6 cc and 50.8 cc, respectively. The marginal dose prescribed to the PTV was the 80% isodose line (IDL), i.e., 54 Gy in 3 fractions for 76 patients (BED10 = 126 Gy) and 50 Gy in 5 fractions for 24 patients (BED10 = 83.3 Gy). Pulmonary heterogeneity has been taken into account by using Monte Carlo or AAA algorithms. Median follow-up was 25 months. Result(s): At 1, 2, 3 and 5 years, local control (LC) was respectively 100, 98.2, 98.2, and 77.7%, and OS was respectively 83, 71.2, 58.1, and 33.2% (median OS was 49 months). Significant OS prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analysis were mean lung BED3 (HR = 1.14, p = 0.01) and PTV volume (HR = 1.01, p = 0.004). A mean lung BED3 <= 5 Gy was significantly associated with a doubling of median OS from 29 months to more than 60 months (not achieved, p = 0.0068). For patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <= 40%, a mean lung BED3 <= 4 Gy was significantly associated with a doubling of median OS from 23 to 46 months (p = 0.019). Conclusion(s): Mean lung BED3 is strongly and significantly associated with OS in SBRT for inoperable Stage I NSCLC. For all treated patients, a mean lung BED3 <= 5 Gy lead to a doubling of median OS. This threshold value should be reduced to 4 Gy for patients with FEV1 <= 40%.© Copyright © 2020 Dupic, Biau, Molnar, Chassin, Dedieu, Lapeyre and Belliere-Calandry.",Excluded

All five animals receiving non-irradiated blood died but the five animals which received irradiated blood were only mildly affected. Highly significant differences were observed in changes to plasma fibrinogen, serum fibrinogen-like proteins, packed cell volume, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, blood kinins, and plasma kininogen levels in the control animals but non-significant changes in these parameters occurred in the group receiving iradiated blood. Significant changes in the antiplasmin alpha 2M, and the antithrombin levels occurred in control cattle but not in the group receiving irradiated blood. Parasite multiplications rates and maximum parasitaemias were similar in both groups. Irradiation reduced the dose of living parasites from 1 x 10(8) to 2.5 x 10(3), but this was not the reason for the mild reactions.

Sampling of minor gland saliva eliminated the possibility of contamination with IgA-rich serum transudates arising from gingival or mucosal pathways which obscured results from previous studies using whole saliva samples. Patients with active extensive clinical disease had significantly depressed levels of salivary IgA.

654,"Is computed tomography cystography indicated in children with pelvic fractures? Purpose: Pelvic fracture evaluation with abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and formal CT cystography for rule out of urine bladder injury have been commonly employed in pediatric trauma patients. The additional delayed imaging required to obtain optimal CT cystography is, however, associated with increased doses of ionizing radiation to pelvic organs and represent a significant risk in the pediatric population for future carcinogenic risk. We hypothesized that avoidance of routine CT cystography among pediatric pelvic fracture victims would not result in an appreciable rate of missed bladder injuries and would aid in mitigating the radiation exposure risk associated with these additional images. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study involving blunt trauma pelvic fractures among pediatric trauma patients (age<14) between the years 1997 and 2016 was conducted utilizing the Israeli National Trauma Registry. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 via the tests of Chi-square test and two-sided Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 1072 children were identified from the registry for inclusion. Mean age of patients was 7.7 years (range 0-14) and 713 (66.5%) were male. Overall mortality in this population was 4.1% (44/1072). Only 2.1% (23) of pediatric patients with pelvic fractures had bladder injury identified, with just 9 children having intraperitoneal bladder rupture (0.8% of all the patients). Conclusion(s): The vast majority of blunt pediatric trauma victims with pelvic fractures do not have urine bladder injuries. Based on our study results we do not recommend the routine utilization of CT cystography in this unique population. Copyright © 2019 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded
3156,"Contrast harmonic imaging ultrasound and perfusion imaging for surveillance after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair regarding detection and characterization of suspected endoleaks OBJECTIVE: Is Contrast Harmonic Imaging (CHI) comparable to computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan in detecting and characterizing suspected endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair in a non-selected group including reintervention procedure and branched endografts in daily practice?, MATERIAL/METHODS: In a prospective study computed tomography angiography (CTA) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) were performed in 30 consecutive patients (26 males, 4 females, mean age: 72 years, range: 38-87) with suspected endoleaks in follow-up (mean 13 months, range: 1-95) after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair or procedure in dissection or penetrated ulcer of the aorta (25 infrarenal, 5 suprarenal stent grafts, mean aortic diameter 56 mm, range: 27-98). CTA was supposed to be gold standard for determining the presence of endoleaks (multislice CT, collimation 16 x 0.75 mm, 100 ml of iodized contrast agent bolus). Ultrasonography used a multi-frequency probe (1-4 MHz) with the modalities of colour coded Doppler sonography (CCDS), power Doppler (PD) combined with contrast enhancement and the technique of contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) and low mechanical index (MI < 0.2). 2.4 ml of SonoVue (Bracco, Altana Pharma GmbH, Italy) were administered to each patient intravenously as a bolus injection., RESULTS: Out of 30 patients, 21 endoleaks were identified in CTA (6 type I or III, 15 type II), 22 in CHI. Thus, sensitivity for CHI was therefore 99%, its specificity 85% (Spearman correlation coefficient (CC) 0.92). In follow-up the localizations of endoleak type I or III exclusively detected by CHI were confirmed as true positive by angiography. Due to its dynamic characteristic CHI seemed to be more helpful in characterization of endoleaks than CTA. In case of a rupture after reintervention a type III endoleak leads to prompt intervention before receiving the result of the CT scan. Altogether, CHI failed to identify 1 combined type I and II endoleak (sensitivity 0.99). Both, CCDS and PD were positive only in 6/30 patients (CC 0.33 and 0.39). Interestingly the application of contrast agent doubles the detection rate of endoleaks (12/30) in CCDS and PD (CC 0.39)., CONCLUSION: Contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA) accurately depicts endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair and stent-graft procedure in dissected and ulcerated aorta. It seems to be superior in characterization of the type of endoleaks and can be established in order to reduce iodized contrast agent and radiation exposure in follow-up. In contrast to CTA scan CHI can be offered to patients with chronic renal insufficiency and allows a dynamic examination and a perfusion analysis.",Excluded
1452,"Evaluation of image quality after implantation of 2 diffractive multifocal intraocular lens models PURPOSE: To compare the visual quality after implantation of multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs)., SETTING: Departments of Ophthalmology, Hospital Quiron and Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain., METHODS: In a prospective nonrandomized consecutive trial, patients had bilateral implantation of Acri.LISA 366D (Group A) or Tecnis ZM900 (Group B) multifocal IOLs. One eye of each patient was included in the study. Three months postoperatively, uncorrected and corrected distance and near visual acuities, pupil diameter, and refraction were assessed. The modulation transfer function (MTF), point-spread function (PSF), and light scattering were calculated using the double-pass Optical Quality Analysis System for distance vision with a 4.0 mm pupil diameter., RESULTS: Each IOL group comprised 20 patients. No statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups in postoperative mean spherical equivalent or mean monocular corrected distance or near visual acuity. The PSF variables were slightly lower in Group B, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant. The MTF parameters (double-pass value at 100%, 20%, and 9% contrast) were slightly higher in Group A (P = .07, P = .04, and P = .09, respectively).

In all, 82 courses were prescribed a dose of 30 to 36 Gy and were included in the toxicity analysis. We recorded the types and grades of acute treatment toxicities and the incidence of infection during TSEBT for comparison with the previously documented baseline incidence of infection in mycosis fungoides., RESULTS: The most common toxicities included erythema/desquamation (76%), blisters (52%), hyperpigmentation (50%), and skin pain (48%). The worst reported toxicity grade per patient was grade 1 in 21%, grade 2 in 67%, and grade 3 in 10%, with no grade 4 or 5 toxicities.

The resultant radiation doses represent less than one per cent of those received by a Northern Ireland individual over a period of 40 years from natural background radiation sources.

2247,"Prolonged Steroid Dependence in Adult Patients With Glioma BACKGROUND/AIM: Prolonged use of glucocorticoids (GC) in glioma treatment can lead to adrenal insufficiency (AI) and subsequent steroid dependence due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This is challenging to diagnose due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms erroneously ascribed to treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors predisposing patients with gliomas to develop AI., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Charts in the neuro-oncology clinic from July 2018 to March 2019 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included >18 y/o with WHO Grade II-IV gliomas, and secondary AI. Demographic profile, tumor characteristics, and treatment profile were compared., RESULTS: The majority of patients were started on high dose dexamethasone at >8 mg daily, and were on dexamethasone for 4-8 months. The minimum dose needed to prevent symptoms was 0.5 mg to 2 mg daily. The majority received standard radiation doses ranging from 54-60 Gy. Most patients had radiation exposure to the HPA axis within the prescription isodose levels., CONCLUSION: Prolonged steroid dependency can result from chronic GC use in patients with glioma. Dose and duration of GC are risk factors for its development. Radiation exposure to the HPA axis may also be a contributing factor.

Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy. In the trial at the commercial facility, radiation at 150 Gy to pupae induced complete adult sterility in all combinations of cross-mating between treated or untreated males and females., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that X-ray radiation can be recommended as an alternative to methyl bromide as phytosanitary treatment for quarantine purpose.",Included

879,"Radiation exposure in total ankle replacement BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures is associated with increased cancer risk. No published data currently exist regarding ionizing radiation exposure in total ankle replacement surgery. This study quantified intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration during ankle replacement surgery and examined patient and technical factors affecting the level of exposure., METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent ankle replacement using STAR, Salto-Talaris, or INBONE total ankles. Intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration, patient demographics, implant design, and accompanying additional procedures were documented for each case. The relationship between each relevant variable and radiation dose and time was determined., RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopic dose and duration for all cases were 1.15 +/- 0.84 milliGray per case and 77 +/- 34 seconds per case, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the absorbed radiation dose and the duration of fluoroscopy (r = .50, P < .001). The mean fluoroscopic doses were 1.53 milliGray, 0.99 milliGray, and 0.88 milliGray for INBONE, STAR, and Salto-Talaris prostheses, respectively. Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.

1938,"Use of radiomics combined with machine learning method in the recurrence patterns after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A preliminary study Objective: To analyze the recurrence patterns and reasons in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to investigate the feasibility of radiomics for analysis of radioresistance. Method(s): We analyzed 306 NPC patients treated with IMRT from Jul-2009 to Aug-2016, 20 of whom developed with recurrence. For the NPCs with recurrence, CT, MR, or PET/CT images of recurrent disease were registered with the primary planning CT for dosimetry analysis. The recurrences were defined as in-field, marginal or out-of-field, according to dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the recurrence volume. To explore the predictive power of radiomics for NPCs with in-field recurrences (NPC-IFR), 16 NPCs with non-progression disease (NPC-NPD) were used for comparison. For these NPC-IFRs and NPC-NPDs, 1117 radiomic features were quantified from the tumor region using pretreatment spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated to identify influential feature subset. Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to assess the capability of each feature on NPC-IFR prediction. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for feature reduction. Artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and validated by using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Result(s): The median follow up was 26.5 (range 8-65) months. 9/20 (45%) occurred in the primary tumor, 8/20 (40%) occurred in regional lymph nodes, and 3/20 (15%) patients developed a primary and regional failure. Dosimetric and target volume analysis of the recurrence indicated that there were 18 in-field, and 1 marginal as well as 1 out-of-field recurrence. With pre-therapeutic SPAIR T2W MRI images available, 11 NPC-IFRs (11 of 18 NPC-IFRs who had available pre-therapeutic MRI) and 16 NPC-NPDs were subsequently employed for radiomic analysis. Results showed that NPC-IFRs vs. NPC-NPDs could be differentiated by 8 features (AUCs: 0.727-0.835). The classification models showed potential in prediction of NPC-IFR with higher accuracies (ANN: 0.812, KNN: 0.775, SVM: 0.732). Conclusion(s): In-field and high-dose region relapse were the main recurrence patterns which may be due to the radioresistance. After integration in the clinical workflow, radiomic analysis can be served as imaging biomarkers to facilitate early salvage for NPC patients who are at risk of in-field recurrence.Copyright © 2018 Li, Wang, Hou, Yang, Ren, Gao, Meng, Wu, Liu, Liu and Yan.

2017,"Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included

Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
1275,"The effect of head-to-trunk position on the direction of arm movements before, during, and after space flight This contribution deals with the examination of the consequences of different head-to-trunk positions on arm movements under normal gravity and during prolonged space flight. One of the objectives of this study was to investigate the influence of weightlessness on the condition of the spatial analysis system. Aimed arm movements in the horizontal plane (pointings towards two visual targets) were recorded, first with eyes open, head straight (learning part), then with eyes closed, head straight and during yaw or roll position of the head (performance part). Measurements related to these different head-to-trunk-positions were taken in one short-term and nine long-term cosmonauts preflight, inflight, and postflight. Terrestrial control experiments were carried out with an extended experimental design in 14 healthy volunteers. The analysis of these experiments revealed that, with eyes closed and the head in yaw position, cosmonauts before flight and control subjects exhibit significant slants of the movement plane of the arm. Contrary to terrestrial measurements, in space experiments roll tilt of the head to the right is correlated with considerable counterclockwise slant of the movement plane. This slant of the movement plane of the arm was interpreted as tilt of the internal representation of the horizontal coordinate. The effect is larger with greater distortion induced by the changed head position and with larger muscular involvement to keep this position. This effect is also increased by the reduction of information (for example, in microgravity). The amount and the direction of the horizontal offset of the arm movements are shown to be dependent on the head-to-trunk position, too. Additionally, we have found changes in the amplitude and in the duration of the arm movement, in the vertical offset, and in the curvature of the movement paths, depending on the experimental conditions.",Excluded
513,"Options for the modified radiation weighting factor of neutrons The recent ICRP Report 92 has noted that the current radiation weighting factor, wR, depends on the energy of the incident neutrons in a manner that differs substantially from the dependence, which results from the current convention, QL. At all neutron energies, but most conspicuously below 1 MeV, the values of wR exceed those of the effective quality factor, qE. The discrepancy is largely due to the fact that--in the absence of computed values of the effective quality factor for neutrons--wR has been patterned after the values of the ambient quality factor, which accounts insufficiently for the low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma ray component from neutron capture in the human body. There are different options to remove the discrepancy. Option 1 is to reduce wR substantially at all neutron energies to make it equal to qE for a standard condition, such as isotropic incidence of the neutrons. Since such a reduction may cause problems in those countries where the current wR values are already legally implemented, ICRP 92 has proposed what is here termed Option 2. It recommended to replace QL by the increased value 1.6 QL - 0.6 and, accordingly, to make the radiation weighting factor equal to 1.6 qE - 0.6. With Option 2 the radiation weighting factor needs to be decreased appreciably at low neutron energies, but for fission neutron spectra the overall changes are minor. To guide--regardless which option is chosen--the selection of the numerical values, the effective quality factor, qE, is computed here for different directional distributions of neutrons incident on the anthropomorphic phantoms ADAM and EVA. None of the sex averaged numerical values is found to deviate much from those for isotropic incidence. Isotropic incidence can, thus, be used as an adequate standard condition. A numerical approximation is proposed for the standard qE that is nearly equivalent to a formula invoked by ICRP 92, but is somewhat simpler and provides realistic values of qE even for the extremely high neutron energies in space. In line with ICRP 92, it is emphasised that wR needs to be seen as a derived quantity related to the LET-dependent weighting factor. Copyright 2004 Oxford University Press",Excluded
93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
2136,"Variation of radius of curvature around the femoral head and its associations with gender and incident radiographic hip osteoarthritis: Data from the osteoarthritis initiative Purpose: To examine whether the shape of the femoral head is associated with gender or incidence of hip osteoarthritis. Method(s): Participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative were eligible for this study if they did not have definite radiographic hip osteoarthritis (RHOA) in at least one hip on their baseline visit pelvis x-ray. Cases of incident RHOA were hips which developed definite RHOA by 48-month follow-up. Control hips were randomly selected, frequency matched by contralateral RHOA status, from hips which had not developed RHOA by 48-month follow-up. The femoral head outline on the baseline x-ray was recorded using a semi-automated method with 60 evenly spaced points placed from the inferior point of the narrowest part of the femoral neck around the femoral head to the superior point of the narrowest part of the femoral neck. The angle of the femoral neck was defined as the angle to the horizontal of a line through the centre point of the femoral neck to the centre point of the femoral head. Over each 10 degree arc around the femoral head, the local radius of curvature was calculated using a least squares fit, and was normalized to the radius of curvature fitted to all points within 90 degrees of the neck-head axis direction, to give a relative curvature, which was plotted as a function of the angle at which the point was relative to the femoral head centre. The angular position of the inflection point on the superior side of the head neck junction at which the outline of the femoral head switched from concave to convex was also recorded (see Figure 1). This gave 19 values of relative curvature, along with the inflection point angle which described the shape of the femoral head. Gender differences in relative curvature values and inflection point angle were examined using ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons. Associations of relative curvature values and inflection point angle with incident RHOA were examined in the following two step process (1) In a univariate analysis, each of the 19 values of relative curvature, along with the inflection point angle was examined as a predictor of incident RHOA using binary logistic regression (with GEE to allow for more than one hip per person in the analysis), with models corrected for covariates of age and body mass index and contralateral RHOA status, (2) Predictors (significant at p<0.05) were then entered into a multivariate model to determine which independently predicted RHOA. Result(s): 678 hips (452 participants) were analysed (265 women, 187 men). In women, there were 68 hips with incident RHOA and 343 control hips. In men, there were 41 hips with incident RHOA and 226 control hips. In hips with no RHOA, inflection point angle was significantly larger in men than women, relative curvature was significantly higher at the supero-lateral (+90 degree) and a more medial position (+40 degrees) in men than women (see Table 1). In the multivariate analysis of the association between femoral head shape and incident RHOA, only 2 relative curvature values (at +80 degrees - supero-medial, and +40 degrees - more medially), along with the inflection point angle were significantly associated with incident RHOA, and all three image based measurements predicted incident RHOA with similar odds ratios (see Table 2). Conclusion(s): Larger inflection angles were associated with increased odds of developing incident RHOA, and larger values existed in normal hips of men compared to women. Flattening of the femoral head superolaterally (+80 degrees) and more medially (+40 degrees) were also independently associated with increased odds of incident RHOA. These two positions were also ones in which gender differences occurred in normal hips. Increased inflection angle may be a measure of pistol grip deformity, known to be associated with RHOA, but this study showed that flattening of the supero-lateral portion of the femoral head (seen more frequently in men) and flattening of the more medial portion of the femoral head (seen more frequently in women) are both independent p edictors of incident RHOA. The mechanisms by which these are associated with gender and incident RHOA, perhaps partly related to incongruence with the acetabulum, need further investigation. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
2961,"Spinal Cord Stimulator-Trial Lead Migration Study Objectives. Investigate whether percutaneous spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads migrate significantly during a 3-day trial, and determine whether the skin anchoring method influences lead migration. Material and Methods. Twenty patients were prospectively enrolled. Ten leads were anchored with suture and tape and 10 were anchored with tape only. A standardized X-ray protocol of lead position was obtained immediately following lead placement and upon completion of the trial. Results. Using a standardized method, SCS leads were measured and movement was calculated. The average movement for leads anchored with tape only was 8.72mm (SD=5.77), inferiorly; while movement for leads anchored with suture and tape was 24.49mm (SD=11.3), inferiorly. A t-test revealed a significant difference between the groups (t=3.9, P=0.001). Conclusions. Percutaneous SCS trial electrodes migrate significantly, inferiorly, during a 3-day trial. Anchoring the trial electrodes to the skin with a suture and tape results in significantly greater inferior migration when compared with anchoring the lead with tape only.

2610,"Effect of Cisplatin on parotid gland function in concomitant radiochemotherapy PURPOSE: To determine the influence of concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin on parotid gland tissue complication probability., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with either radiotherapy (n = 61) or concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin (n = 36) for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively evaluated. The dose and volume distributions of the parotid glands were noted in dose-volume histograms. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before, during the 2(nd) and 6(th) weeks and at 4 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. The data were fit using the normal tissue complication probability model of Lyman. Complication was defined as a reduction of the salivary flow rate to less than 25% of the pretreatment flow rate., RESULTS: The normal tissue complication probability model parameter TD(50) (the dose leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 32.2 Gy at 4 weeks and 32.1 Gy at 6 months for concomitant radiochemotherapy and 41.1 Gy at 4 weeks and 39.6 Gy at 6 months for radiotherapy. The tolerated dose for concomitant radiochemotherapy was at least 7 to 8 Gy lower than for radiotherapy alone at TD(50)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concomitant radiochemotherapy tended to cause a higher probability of parotid gland tissue damage. Advanced radiotherapy planning approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be particularly important for parotid sparing in radiochemotherapy because of cisplatin-related increased radiosensitivity of glands.",Excluded
717,"Patient perceptions of computed tomographic imaging and their understanding of radiation risk and exposure STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe patient perceptions of computed tomography (CT) and their understanding of radiation exposure and risk., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of acute abdominal pain patients aged 18 years or older. Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed., RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record., CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.

All patients enrolled have received cranial radiotherapy and were diagnosed with radiation-induced brain injury. Patients fulfilling certain eligibility criteria were recruited for analysis. The clinical therapeutic effects were observed and evaluated by LENT/SOMA scores before and one month after treatment in these two groups, respectively., RESULTS: The therapeutic effects of headache (total efficiency 75.76%), eurologic deficit (total efficiency 81.58%), cognitive functions (total efficiency 77.78%) and MRI results (total efficiency 74.29%) were better in the experimental group than those in the control group (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in mood and personality changes between these two groups., CONCLUSIONS: Administration of Dl-3-n-butylphthalide, in adjunct to corticosteroid therapy, might provide a better outcome in patients with radiation-induced brain injury.",Excluded
213,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
3246,"Decreased radiation doses to oral cavity with stick-out tongue position comparing to neutral tongue position in patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Case report Purpose/Objective(s): To compare changes in oral cavity (OC) shapes and radiation dose to OC with different tongue positions in intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Materials/Methods: 13 patients with HNSCC underwent CT-simulations with neutral tongue position and stick-out tongue for planning IMRTs (IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively). Planning objectives were to deliver 70 Gy, 63 Gy, and 56 Gy in 35 fractions to 95% of PTVs using simultaneously integrated boost technique, with mean radiation doses (Dmean) of < 26 Gy to the parotid gland, < 30 Gy to the submandibular gland, and < 36 Gy to OC. For other organs at risk (OARs), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommended dose constraints were applied. Planning was optimized to minimize doses to OARs without compromising coverage of PTVs. Radiation doses to OC in IMRT-N and IMRT-S was compared. Data are presented as mean >= standard deviation. Result(s): OC volumes were similar in IMRT-N and IMRT-S (129 >= 34.0 cm3 and 130.8 >= 38.8 cm3, respectively, P = 0.25). Tongue volume in outside of mouth was 7.1 >= 3.8 cm3 (5.4 >= 2.6% of entire OC and 7.8 >= 3.1% of oral tongue) in IMRT-S. Anterior tip of lips to gingiva was 0.9 >= 0.4 cm in IMRT-S and 0.1 >= 0.2 cm in IMRT-N (P<0.001). Distance from base of tongue (BOT) to pharyngeal constrictor (PC) was 1.5 >= 0.5 cm in IMRT-N and 2.0 >= 0.6 cm in IMRT-S (p<0.001). IMRT-N and IMRT-S showed equivalent radiation targets coverages with sparing OARs, except OC. Dmean of OC was 34.9 >= 8.0 Gy and 31.4 >= 8.7 Gy with IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). OC volume receiving >= 36 Gy (V36) was 40.6 >= 16.9% using IMRT-N compared to 33.0 >= 17.0% with IMRT-S (P<0.001). Dmean of oral tongue was 38.1 >= 7.9 Gy and 32.8 >= 8.8 Gy in IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). Dmean of lips was 16.0 >= 3.7 Gy in IMRT-N and 13.5 >= 4.0 Gy in IMRT-S (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): IMRT-S for patients with HNSCC has significant decreased radiation dose to OC and increased distance from BOT to PC and from dorsal surface of tongue to palate than IMRT-N. The use of IMRT-S rather than IMRT-N can significantly decrease radiation dose to OARs in OC or pharynx, which may potentially reduce RT related toxicity in OC or pharynx in patients RT for HNSCC.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three radiologists retrospectively reviewed the pretreatment x-ray angiographic and MR angiographic studies obtained in 30 consecutive patients: 15 patients (15 limbs) evaluated for limb salvage and 15 patients (20 limbs) evaluated because of claudication. MR angiography included acquisition of 2D contrast-enhanced MR digital subtraction angiograms of the area from the adductor canal to the feet and 3D spoiled gradient-recalled-echo bolus chase MR angiograms obtained in three stations from the aorta to the middle portion of the calf. Each reader reviewed the x-ray and MR angiograms to determine the inflow and outflow segments for a hypothetical bypass graft placement. RESULT(S): The three readers selected identical segments for inflow at MR angiography and x-ray angiography in 32, 32, and 35 of the 35 limbs evaluated (mean percentages of agreement [95% Cl]: 91% [77%, 98%], 91% [77%, 98%], and 95% [90%, 100%], respectively).

663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach.

1521,"Dosimetric coverage of the external anal sphincter by 3-dimensional conformal fields in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation: implications for the concept of sphincter-preserving radiation therapy BACKGROUND: We evaluated the anatomic location of the external anal sphincter (EAS) to pelvic bony landmarks related to 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DRT) and studied the dosimetric coverage of the EAS in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer., METHODS: Sixty-four consecutive rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation were included. All patients were treated in a prone position on a bellyboard by 3DRT. The inferior border of the RT fields was at least 3-5 cm inferior to the gross tumorous volume (GTV) or at the inferior border of the obturator foramen (IBOF), whichever was more inferior. The EAS was contoured and dose distributions were determined using dose-volume histograms., RESULTS: In 53 out of 64 cases (82.8%), the EAS was completely inferior to the IBOF. In the remaining 11 cases, the EAS was either overlapping the IBOF (10 cases; 15.6%) or completely superior to the IBOF (1 case; 1.7%). The average mean dose delivered to the EAS was 2795 cGy. Lower mean doses were delivered to the EAS when the center of the EAS was located more distant from the GTV., CONCLUSIONS: Meticulous planning to define the inferior border of the RT field is recommended to avoid irradiating the EAS.",Excluded
3093,"T1/T2 matching to differentiate tumor growth from radiation effects after stereotactic radiosurgery Objective: We define magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical criteria that differentiate radiation effect (RE) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): We correlated postoperative imaging and histopathological data in 68 patients who underwent delayed resection of a brain metastasis after SRS. Surgical resection was required in these patients because of clinical and imaging evidence of lesion progression 0.3 to 27.7 months after SRS. At the time of SRS, the median target volume was 7.1 mL (range, 0.5-26 mL), which increased to 14 mL (range, 1.3-81 mL) at the time of surgery. After initial SRS, routine contrast-enhanced MRI was used to assess tumor response and to detect potential adverse radiation effects. We retrospectively correlated these serial MRIs with the postoperative histopathology to determine if any routine MRI features might differentiate tumor progression from RE. Result(s): The median time from SRS to surgical resection was 6.9 months (range, 0.3-27.7 months). A shorter interval from SRS to resection was associated with a higher rate of tumor recurrence (P = .014). A correspondence between the contrast-enhanced volume on T1-weighted images and the low signal-defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images (""T1/T2 match"") was associated with tumor progression at histopathology (P < .0001). Lack of a clear and defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images compared to the margin of contrast uptake on T1-weighted images (""T1/T2 mismatch"") was significantly associated with a higher rate of RE in pathological specimens (P < .0001). The sensitivity of the T1/T2 mismatch in identifying RE was 83.3%, and the specificity was 91.1%. Conclusion(s): We found that time to progression and T1/T2 mismatch were able to differentiate tumor progression from RE in most patients. When REs are suspected, surgery may not be necessary if patients respond to conservative measures. When tumor progression is suspected, resection or repeat radiosurgery can be effective, depending on the degree of mass effect. © 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded

We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded
3090,"Mouse spleen lymphocyte bactericidal and peroxidase activities: enhancement by whole body x-irradiation A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included
2871,"Dose-Volume Parameters Predict Radiation Pneumonitis after Surgery with Induction Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Non-small Cell Lung Cancer To clarify the relationship between dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters and radiation pneumonitis (RP) after surgery in cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Patients with NSCLC treated with induction CCRT (chemotherapy: cisplatin and docetaxel; radiotherapy: 2.0 Gy fractions once daily for a total of 46 Gy) before surgery were reviewed. We calculated the percentage of lung volume receiving at least 20 Gy (V20) and the mean lung dose (MLD) for the total lung volume and the lung remaining after resection. Factors affecting the incidence of RP at grade 2 or higher (>= G2 RP) were analyzed. Eighteen of 49 patients (37%) experienced >=G2 RP. The V20 and MLD for the lung remaining after resection (V20r and MLDr) were significant predictors according to the multivariate analysis (p=0.007 and 0.041, respectively). The incidence of >=G2 RP was 8% in patients with V20r<10%, and 13% in patients with MLDr<5.6 Gy, respectively. The optimal approach to reduce the rate of postoperative RP in patients with induction CCRT for NSCLC is to keep the V20r below 10% and/or the MLDr below 5.6 Gy in the radiotherapy planning.",Excluded
1815,"Clinical characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension Introduction and Aims: Intradialytic hypertension with a prevalence of 15% among hemodialysis patients is with unknown pathophysiology, demographic, laboratory and clinical characteristic of patients, and it's influence on long - lasting clinical effects (cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, rate of hospitalization). So, the aim of the study is to present the clinical, laboratory and demographic characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension in our dialysis center. Method(s): Of total 110 hemodialysis patients, 17 patients (15,45%) were intradialytic hypertensive - started at a systolic pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or had an increase in systolic pressure more than 10 mm Hg during the session, and 17 patients were normotensive or had a drop in blood pressure during the dialysis. HD were performed 3 times per week with a duration of 4-5 hours, on machines with controlled ultrafiltration and high flux syntetic membrane ( polyetersulfon) sterilized with gamma rays. It was used dialysate with standard electrolytes content (Na+ 138 mmol/L, K+ 2,0 mmol/L, Ca++ 1,5 mmol/L, Mg +1,0 mmol/L, CH3COO- 3,0 mmol/L, Cl -110 mmol/l, HCO3- 35 mmol/L). Analysed demographic and clinical characteristics were: gender, age, BMI, dialysis vintage, vascular acces, cardiovascular comorbidity (cardiomyopathy, ischemic cardiac disease, peripheral artery disease, heart valve disease), number and type of antihypertensive drugs, a weekly dose of erythropoesis - stimulating agent, standard monthly, three and six months laboratory analyzes, and sp Kt/V and PCR. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0. Result(s): In the both groups were more men (IDH group 88,23%, control group 64,07%). IDH group was older (59,00+/- 7,64 versus 49.00+/- 13,91, p= 0,314) and with lower BMI (p = 0,246) compared to control group. Significantly lower serum sodium and higher sodium gradient had IDH patients (135,75+/-2,03 versus 137,33 +/-1,97, p= 0,042; 2,25+/-1,98 versus 0,66+/-1,44, p=0,0267, respestively). In other laboratory analysis there was no statistically significant differences between two groups. IDH group had significantly higher interdialysis weight gain and less effective ultrafiltration individually at each dialysis session compared to the control group (2,23 +/-0,866 versus 2,37+/-0,69, p=0,011; 3,87+/-1,26 versus 3,56+/-1.18, p=0,025, respectively). The systolic and mean arterial pressure after the HD were statistically higher in IDH group, receiving multiple antihypertensive drugs and have more cardiovascular diseases compared to patients without intradialytic hypertension. Conclusion(s): Older, lower BMI, border hyponatremia, higher sodium gradient, smaller ultrafiltration rate, higher cardiovascular morbidity and more use of antihypertensive drugs are the clinical characteristics of patients with intradialytic hypertension.",Excluded
2658,"A single-center pilot study for radiosensitization of everolimus with external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine liver metastasis Background: Liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NELM) are common.

Method(s): Prospective study of 14 patients with <4 NELM, progressing on standard therapy, treated with E for 28 days prior to, concurrent with, and 14 days following RT. A safety run-in of 2 patients at E 2.5 mg daily, then 5 mg daily were completed prior to treating 10 patients with 7.5 mg daily. RTwas delivered using either conventional radiation (cRT) 30 Gy in 10 fractions or stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) 35-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Per lesion response was evaluated per RECIST v1.1, and toxicity per the CTCAE v4.03. Result(s): 40 NELM were treated in 14 patients (7 male and 7 female), with a median age of 63 (47-88). Primaries included lung (4), small bowel (6), colorectal (3) and renal (1); Gr.I/typical lung (4) and Gr.II/atypical lung (10). Median radiation dose delivered (BED10) was 72 Gy (range 39-180). The overall response rate (ORR) was 33%; no patients developed progression at a treated NELM in the 12 month follow-up period. Median change in size per metastasis was -23%(-100% to 7%). 1 patient developed pseudoprogression. Median time to best response was 9 months. One patient at the 7.5mg dose discontinued E post-RT due to Grade 2 thrombocytopenia, and one patient at the 7.5 mg dose had Grade 3 hypertension which resolved after completing E. Conclusion(s): Concurrent E and liver RT is safe. No patients developed progression of their treated NELM in the 12 months post treatment; further follow-up is required to determine long-term control. Combination E and RT may be an option for patients with low-volume NELM; further investigation is warranted for this promising approach.",Excluded

Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy. In order to provide a comparison, the values for 24 fractions of 60Co gamma-rays given in 39 days (a clinical protocol used in the Groote Schuur Hospital) were 74.02 +/- 2.92 and 66.72 +/- 1.93 Gy for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis, respectively. For the unfiltered beam, values for the comparative biological effectiveness (CBE) were 3.96 and 3.00 for the early and late skin response, respectively. The corresponding CBE values were for the filtered beam 2.99 and 2.86. These results for the Faure neutron therapy facility can be extrapolated to the human situation with a high degree of confidence, so that the neutron dose which would yield acceptable skin damage in patients may be determined using the data presented here.",Included
2346,"Effect of a proton pump inhibitor on postprandial gastric volume, emptying and symptoms in healthy human subjects: A pilot study Background: In consensus guidelines, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for the treatment of functional dyspepsia. It is unclear whether PPIs change gastric volume or emptying. Aim(s): To assess the effect of a PPI, rabeprazole, on gastric volume and emptying and postprandial symptoms. Method(s): In a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, 13 healthy participants were randomized to rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., or placebo. On day 3, fasting gastric volume was measured using intravenous 99mTc- pertechnate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After the last dose of study medication, an 111In-chloride egg meal (300 kcal) was ingested, and postprandial gastric volume and emptying were measured by SPECT. Symptom ratings using a visual analogue scale (fullness, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, aggregate score) were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min postprandially. Group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in gastric volume or emptying in the two groups. However, there was a borderline increase in gastric volume with rabeprazole compared with placebo. Rabeprazole treatment reduced aggregate postprandial symptoms, particularly fullness, 30 min after the meal (P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): In healthy participants, rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., did not significantly change gastric emptying, but reduced symptoms and had a borderline effect on gastric volume postprandially.

1437,"Navigated minimally invasive unilateral laminotomy with crossover for intraoperative prediction of outcome in degenerative lumbar stenosis Background: Different surgical techniques have been described for treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis (DLS). Only postoperative measures have been identified as predictors of efficacy of decompression. The objective of this study is to assess the role of navigated unilateral laminotomy with crossover to achieve and predict a satisfying decompression and outcome in DLS. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled patients with DLS who underwent navigation-assisted unilateral laminotomy with crossover. The extent of decompression was evaluated during surgery using neuronavigation. The outcome was assessed through the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) for leg pain. Outcome correlation with the extent of the intraoperative bone decompression was analyzed. Finally, the outcome, surgical time, and in-hospital length-of-stay were compared with a control group treated through standard unilateral laminotomy. Result(s): Twenty-five patients were treated using the navigated technique (Group A), 25 using the standard unilateral laminotomy (Group B). In Group A, a cut-off value >=0.9 cm for bone decompression revealed to be an intraoperative predictor of good outcome, both regarding the ODI and VAS scores (P = 0.0005; P = 0.002). As compared with Group B, patients operated using the navigated technique showed similar operative times, in-hospital length-of-stay, ODI scores, but improved VAS scores for leg pain (P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): The intraoperative navigated evaluation of the bone decompression could predict the outcome allowing satisfactory results in unilateral laminotomy for DLS. The navigated technique also could lead to an improved decompression of lateral recesses resulting in better control of leg pain as compared to standard unilateral laminotomy.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Craniovertebral Junction and Spine Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",Excluded
1653,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity] Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded
999,"Oblique corpectomy for treatment of cervical spine epidural abscesses: Report on four cases Background Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) in cervical locations are particularly life-threatening. Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded
1149,"Clinical outcome of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and oligometastatic lung tumors: A single institutional study with almost uniform dose with different five treatment schedules Background: To evaluate clinical outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for localized primary and oligometastatic lung tumors by assessing efficacy and safety of 5 regimens of varying fraction size and number. Method(s): One-hundred patients with primary lung cancer (n = 69) or oligometastatic lung tumors (n = 31), who underwent SBRT between May 2003 and August 2010, were included. The median age was 75 years (range, 45-88). Of them, 98 were judged to have medically inoperable disease, predominantly due to chronic illness or advanced age. SBRT was performed using 3 coplanar and 3 non-coplanar fixed beams with a standard linear accelerator. Fraction sizes were escalated by 1 Gy, and number of fractions given was decreased by 1 for every 20 included patients. Total target doses were between 50 and 56 Gy, administered as 5-9 fractions. The prescribed dose was defined at the isocenter, and median overall treatment duration was 10 days (range, 5-22). Result(s): The median follow-up was 51.1 months for survivors. The 3-year local recurrence rates for primary lung cancer and oligometastasis was 6 % and 3 %, respectively. The 3-year local recurrence rates for tumor sizes <=3 cm and >3 cm were 3 % and 14 %, respectively (p = 0.124). Additionally, other factors (fraction size, total target dose, and BED10) were not significant predictors of local control. Radiation pneumonia (>= grade 2) was observed in 2 patients. Radiation-induced rib fractures were observed in 22 patients. Other late adverse events of greater than grade 2 were not observed. Conclusion(s): Within this dataset, we did not observe a dose response in BED10 values between 86.4 and 102.6 Gy. SBRT with doses between 50 and 56 Gy, administered over 5-9 fractions achieved acceptable tumor control without severe complications.Copyright © 2016 Aoki et al.",Excluded

1035,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded

This retrospective study evaluates the long-term results and side effects of GKR in the treatment of TN focusing on potentially predictive factors. METHOD(S): One hundred sixty patients with TN were included in this study (minimum follow-up, >6 mo; mean, 37.4 mo; range, 6-144 mo). In 92 patients, GKR represented the first nonmedical option (""primary GKR""). In 68 patients, invasive treatments had been previously attempted. All patients were treated using a single 4-mm collimator shot targeting the pontine trigeminal root entry zone with a maximal dose of 75 to 95 Gy. Brainstem dose exposure never exceeded 15 Gy. Treatment outcome results were classified as Grade I (pain-free with no pharmacological treatment), Grade II (pain-free with pharmacological treatment), and Grade III (no result). Data were analyzed using the log-rank test for univariate analysis and the ordered logit model for multivariate analysis. RESULT(S): In the overall series, 98 (61%) out of 160 patients reached a Grade I outcome, 45 (29%) reached a Grade II outcome, and 17 (10%) patients had no results from GKR. These results were encouraging for patients with typical facial pain features and for patients treated by a ""primary"" gamma knife. Considering the global outcome, the most effective and safest dose was found to be in the 80 to 90 Gy range.

We report on outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We analyzed 69 patients treated between 2000 and 2019. FSRT was delivered with a median total dose of 54 Gy (single fraction: 1.8 Gy). PRO questionnaires were sent to 28 patients. Median overall survival was 17.2 years; mean local control was 15.6 years (median not reached). Median follow-up was 5.8 years. Twenty (71%) patients participated in the PRO assessment. Physicians reported symptoms grade >=3 in 6 cases (9%). Of all, 35 (51%) patients suffered from hypopituitarism at baseline, and during follow-up, new or progressive hypopituitarism was observed in 11 cases (16%). Patients reported 10 cases of severe side effects. Most of these symptoms were already graded as CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 2 by a physician in a previous follow-up exam. PROs are an essential measure and only correlate to a certain extent with the physician-reported outcomes. For high-precision radiotherapy of pituitary adenomas, they confirm excellent overall outcomes and low toxicity. In the future, the integration of PROs paired with high-end treatment will further improve outcomes.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

Thyroid uptakes of 3--5% of the administered 2 mCi dose were found despite prior administration of Lugol's iodine. Analysis of serum samples over a ten day period after iodocholesterol injection indicated that less than 10% of the radioactivity was free iodide. Kinetic results showed a high value for the thyroid/plasma 131I ratio indicating thyroid retention of 131I. This was substantiated by thyroid scintigrams. The thyroid radiation dose was estimated to be 200--250 rad for the two patients.

189,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included
1144,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included

During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method.

Our aim was to investigate the outcome of patients aged 80+ years undergoing curative intent intensity- or volume-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT/VMAT)., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our HNT patients aged 80+ treated with curative IMRT/VMAT from December 2003 to November 2015. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), and treatment tolerance were assessed. Outcome results were compared with that of a younger HNT patient cohort from our hospital., RESULTS: A total of 140 consecutive patients were included (65 postoperative, 75 definitive). Mean/median age at treatment start was 84.8/84.1 years (range 80-96 years). Mean/median follow-up time was 25/16 months (range 2-92 months). Of the 140 patients, 80 were alive with no evidence of disease when last seen, 28 had died due to the cancer, 12 remained alive with disease, the remaining 20 died intercurrently. Systemic concomitant therapy was administered in 7 %. Late grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 2 %. All patients completed treatment. Hospitalization and feeding tube rates were 26 % and 11 %, respectively. The 2-/3-year LC, DFS, and OS rates for the entire cohort were 81/80 %, 69/63 %, and 68/66 %, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients showed an inferior 3-year OS rate as compared to non-SCC patients (62 % vs 77 %, p = 0.0002), while LC and DFS did not differ. Patients undergoing postoperative radiation attained a higher OS compared to the definitively irradiated subgroup with 74 vs. 60 % at 3 years (p = 0.01); however, DFS rates were similar for both groups (68 vs. 61 %, p = 0.15). Corresponding rates for >1400 HNT patients <80 years treated during the same time interval were 81/80 %, 69/67 %, and 77/72 %, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment tolerance in our patients aged 80+ was high. These results suggest that elderly HNT patients should not be denied potentially curative treatment strategies.",Excluded
2010,"The prognostic role of hemoglobin levels in patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiation for anal cancer Background: Concurrent chemo-radiation (CT-RT) is a standard therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of anal canal. Different clinical and biological factors may potentially affect outcome. We investigated the prognostic role of baseline hemoglobin (Hb) in a cohort of anal cancer patients submitted to CT-RT with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. Method(s): Up to 161 patients with clinical stage T1-T4/N0-N3/M0 were treated. Response was assessed at 6 weeks and thereafter at 3, 6 and 12 months. Two different approaches were used:a)simultaneous integrated boost following RTOG 05-29 indications;b)first sequence of 45Gy/25 fractions to the pelvis followed by 9-14.4 Gy/5-8 fractions to the macroscopic disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment Hb level had a significant correlation to OS (HR:0.53;95% CI:0.33-0.87; p = 0.001), but not to PFS (HR:0.78;95% CI:0.53-1.15; p = 0.12) Patients with pre-treatment Hb >= 12 g/dl had 5-year PFS and OS of 82.2%, compared to 29.3% and 32.8% for those below the threshold. The likelihood to achieve a complete remission increased by 5.6% for every single-unit (g/dl) increase in baseline Hb level over 11 g/dl. On multivariate analysis, response to treatment had a significant correlation to PFS (incomplete vs complete response - HR:5.43;95% CI:2.75-10.7; p < 0.0001) and OS (HR: 6.96;95% CI:2.96-16.5; p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): We showed that baseline Hb level is a strong indicator for poor response to RT-CT in anal cancer patients. A close clinical monitoring for incomplete response to treatment should be advised in patients with low pre-treatment Hb. The hypothesis that the preservation of adequate Hb level during treatment may lead to a better outcome needs prospective evaluation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
1392,"DNA-protein crosslinks as a biomarker of exposure to solar radiation: a preliminary study in brick-kiln workers In India, fired clay bricks are produced in small-scale factories. There are 60, 000 active brick kilns, providing employment to nearly 12 million people in different suboccupations. This industry is largely non-mechanized and operates from November to June. Almost all the workers are exposed to direct sunlight for 8-10 h a day. Cellular DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are the biologically active nucleoprotein complexes formed between DNA and proteins. Ultraviolet light and gamma-rays, and other suspected carcinogens in humans, induce DPC formation in blood cells. DPCs have therefore been identified as a biomarker for monitoring exposure to these hazardous agents. Here we report steady-state levels of DPCs in human peripheral lymphocytes from 46 brick-kiln workers exposed occupationally for 8-10 h a day to solar radiation in brickfields and 25 unexposed controls. A significant increase (p <0.05) in DPC content and DPC coefficients in peripheral lymphocytes was observed in the brick-kiln workers compared with the controls. The data suggest that the DPC content of lymphocytes could be a possible biomarker of exposure to solar radiation. However, further work is necessary to confirm this.",Excluded
877,"Gamma radiation tolerance in different life stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster PURPOSE: Insects are known to have higher levels of radiation tolerance than mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included
564,"Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry for Measurement of Phalangeal Bone Mineral Density on a Slot-Scanning Digital Radiography System Objective: In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using two detectors in a slot-scanning digital radiography system to acquire images for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of the middle phalanx of the middle finger using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Method(s): Simulations were used to evaluate the spectral separation of the low- and high-energy spectra and detective quantum efficiency was used for assessing image quality. Scan parameters were chosen to optimize spectral separation, image quality, and radiation dose. We introduce the measurement of volumetric BMD (vBMD) using basis material decomposition. We assess the accuracy of our methods by comparing measurements taken using bone images against reference data derived from subsequent incineration of the bones. In vivo scans were conducted to evaluate the system precision (repeatability) and agreement with a clinical densitometer. Result(s): Average errors for bone mineral content (BMC), areal BMD (aBMD), and vBMD were 4.85%, 5.49%, and 12.77%, respectively. Our system had good agreement with a clinical densitometer based on concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.92 and 0.98 for aBMD and BMC, respectively. Precision studies yielded coefficient of variation (CV) values of 1.35% for aBMD, 1.48% for BMC, and 1.80% for vBMD. The CV values of all measurements were within 2%, indicating that the methods have clinically acceptable precision. Conclusion(s): We conclude that our techniques yield bone measurements with high accuracy, clinically acceptable precision, and good agreement with a clinical densitometer. Significance: We have shown the clinical potential of phalangeal DXA measurements of aBMD and vBMD on a slot-scanning digital radiography system.Copyright © 2015 IEEE.",Excluded
2553,"Correlation of physical exam findings with fever in patients with skin and soft tissue infections Introduction: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of fever in adult ED patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and to determine which, if any, physical exam, radiograph and laboratory test findings were associated with fever. Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study at an urban county trauma center of adults who presented to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. ED providers measured area of erythema and induration using a tape measure, and completed data sheets indicating comorbid conditions and the presence or absence of physical exam findings. Fever was defined as any recorded temperature > 38degreeC during the first six hours of ED evaluation. Result(s): Of the 734 patients enrolled, 96 (13.1%) had fever. Physical and laboratory exam findings associated with the presence of a fever in multivariable logistic regression were the area of erythema, particularly the largest quartile of area of erythema, 144-5,000 cm2, (odd ratio [OR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.6-5.2]) and leukocytosis (OR = 4.4, 95% CI [2.7-7.0]). Bullae, necrosis, streaks, adenopathy, and bone involvement on imaging were not associated with fever. Conclusion(s): Fever is uncommon in patients presenting to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. Area of erythema and leukocytosis were associated with fever and should be considered in future decision rules for the evaluation and treatment of SSTI.Copyright © 2017 Mongelluzzo et al.",Excluded
441,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

All but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 51 patients, 33 received combinations of X-rays (median 46 Gy) and protons (median 36 GyE) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-rays and proton radiation for these 33 patients was 80 GyE (range 70-90 GyE). The other 18 patients received proton-beam therapy alone (median 79 GyE, range 62-98 GyE)., RESULTS: Treatment interruption due to radiation-induced esophagitis or hematologic toxicity was not required for any patient. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 51 patients was 21.1% and the median survival time was 20.5 months (95% confidence interval 10.9-30.2). Of the 51 patients, 40 (78%) showed a complete response within 4 months after completing treatment and seven (14%) showed a partial response, giving a response rate of 92% (47/51). The 5-year local control rate for all 51 patients was 38.0% and the median local control time was 25.5 months (95% confidence interval 14.6-36.3)., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton-beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

28,"The effect of sex difference on induction of intestinal metaplasia in rats Attempts were made to examine the sexual effects on the induction of intestinal metaplasia in rats. The number and locus of intestinal metaplasia in the gastric region induced by 2,000 rads of X-ray were greater in the male than in the female. Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones. Therefore, it is likely that male sex hormones are promoting while female sex hormones are inhibiting the development of intestinal metaplasia.",Included
1959,"Neurosurgery and prognosis in patients with radiation-induced brain injury after nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy: A follow-up study Background: Radiotherapy is the standard radical treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and may cause radiation-induced brain injury (RI). Treatment for RI remains a challenge. We conducted this study to investigate the indications of neurosurgery, operation time and prognosis of patients with RI after NPC radiotherapy who underwent neurosurgical management. Method(s): This was a follow-up study between January 2005 and July 2011. Fifteen NPC cases of RI who underwent neurosurgery were collected. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), surgery and histology were studied. The outcome was assessed by LENT/SOMA scales and modified Rankin scale. Result(s): Brain lesion resection (86.7%) was more common than decompressive craniotomy (13.3%). According to LENT/SOMA scale before and six months after surgery, 13 of 15, 12 of 15, 14 of 15, and 14 of 15 cases showed improvement at subjective, objective, management and analytic domains, respectively. 12 of 15 patients showed improvement of modified Rankin scale after surgery. Three patients who underwent emergency surgery showed significant improvement (average score increment of 2, 2.7, 2.7, 3 and 2 at LENT/SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively), as compared with 12 cases underwent elective surgery (average score increment of 1, 1, 1.4, 1.8 and 1 at LENT SOMA scale subjective, objective, management, analytic, and modified Rankin scale, respectively). Conclusion(s): Neurosurgery, including brain necrotic tissue resection and decompressive craniotomy, improves the prognosis for RI patients, especially for those with indications of emergency surgery. © 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1344,"Informatics in radiology: use of a C-arm fluoroscopy simulator to support training in intraoperative radiography Mobile image intensifier systems (C-arms) are used frequently in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery, especially in trauma and emergency settings, but image quality and radiation exposure levels may vary widely, depending on the extent of the C-arm operator's knowledge and experience. Current training programs consist mainly of theoretical instruction in C-arm operation, the physical foundations of radiography, and radiation avoidance, and are largely lacking in hands-on application. A computer-based simulation program such as that tested by the authors may be one way to improve the effectiveness of C-arm training. In computer simulations of various scenarios commonly encountered in the operating room, trainees using the virtX program interact with three-dimensional models to test their knowledge base and improve their skill levels. Radiographs showing the simulated patient anatomy and surgical implants are ""reconstructed"" from data computed on the basis of the trainee's positioning of models of a C-arm, patient, and table, and are displayed in real time on the desktop monitor. Trainee performance is signaled in real time by color graphics in several control panels and, on completion of the exercise, is compared in detail with the performance of an expert operator. Testing of this computer-based training program in continuing medical education courses for operating room personnel showed an improvement in the overall understanding of underlying principles of intraoperative radiography performed with a C-arm, with resultant higher image quality, lower overall radiation exposure, and greater time efficiency.

721,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are sex specific Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads. These data constitute the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced bystander effects in mouse spleen in vivo. We show the role of sex hormones in spleen bystander responses and discuss implications of the observed changes.",Included
163,"Evaluation of radiation-induced changes to parotid glands following conventional radiotherapy in patients with nasopharygneal carcinoma Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included

For patients in the LDR group (n = 341), the treatment sources consisted of Ir-192 pin for 227 patients (1973-1996; irradiated dose, 61-85 Gy; median, 70 Gy), Ra-226 needle for 113 patients (1967-1986; 55-93 Gy; median, 70 Gy). Ra-226 and Ir-192 were combined for one patient. Ir-192 HDR (microSelectron-HDR) was used for 58 patients in the HDR group (1991-present; 48-60 Gy; median, 60 Gy). LDR implantations were performed via oral and HDR via a submental/submandibular approach. The dose rates at the reference point for the LDR group were 0.30 to 0.8 Gy/h, and for the HDR group 1.0 to 3.4 Gy/min.

The experimental group (30 patients) was treated with ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" during the full course of radiotherapy, 4 times daily with 5 mL and 5 min each time. The control group (30 patients) rinsed the mouth in the same way with normal saline. Oral mucositis was assessed according to the RTOG criteria. The severity of mucositis and the degree of pain were recorded and photographed. Patients shouldn't be treated with other drugs until the level of oral mucositis reached above grade III. The results were statistically analyzed using Stata 12.0 software packages., RESULTS: Age, gender, radiotherapy techniques and dose showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The first onset of oral mucositis in the experimental group was later than that in the control group (11.0 times:9.1 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of pain at the early time of radiotherapy was lower (36.7%: 70.0%, P<0.05).

The final response status was determined according to volume criteria derived from a 1 year post-treatment MRI or last available follow-up MRI. Tumours were characterised as responders, non-responders, progressors and non-progressors and compared for Ktrans(2), rCBF and rCBV differences. Uni- and multivariate analysis evaluated factors associated with tumour response and progression at 1 week and 1 month. A generalised estimating equations (GEE) model accounted for multiple tumours per subject. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis identified optimal cut-off values, sensitivity and specificity for response or progression., RESULTS: Tumour responders showed lower Ktrans(2) and reduced rCBF at 1 week (P < 0.05 each). Progressive disease showed lower rCBF and reduced rCBV at 1 month (P < 0.05 each). GEE and multivariate analysis revealed lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week, an absence of prior radiation predicted response. At 1 month only lower rCBV predicted progressive disease on GEE and multivariate analysis. Optimal cut-off points for Ktrans(2) and rCBV were 1.37 and 2.03 with sensitivity and specificity of 61.5 and 81.1% and 73.9 and 81.8%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week and rCBV at 1 month discriminated responders and progressive disease, respectively.

1554,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for elderly patients with locally advanced rectal cancer-a real-world outcome study OBJECTIVE: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has been established as a standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. It is unclear whether preoperative chemoradiotherapy is truly beneficial in the elderly patients. Our aim was to assess the impact of age on the treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 160 consecutive patients with clinical stage T3-4, and/or lymph node positive tumors who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy from May 2003 to December 2010 at a single hospital. Treatment tolerance and outcomes were compared between patients >=70 years (N = 56) and <70 years (N = 104)., RESULTS: There was no disparity in the achievement of prescribed radiation dose and dose reduction of chemotherapy between two groups. Pathologic complete response rate (15.6% vs. 16.0%) and sphincter preservation rate (91.1% vs. 95.0%; P = 0.459) were not significantly different. The 3-year disease-free survival of older vs. younger patients was 77.8% vs. 92.3% and 5-year disease-free survival was 60.0% vs. 78.6%, respectively (P = 0.023). In multivariable analysis, age was significantly associated with disease-free survival (P = 0.033) but comorbidities were not (P = 0.092). However, both age (hazard ratio, 2.331; P = 0.028) and comorbidities (hazard ratio, 2.772; P = 0.031) were significantly associated with overall survival as well as clinical stage. Anemia was the only adverse effect more prominent in older patients., CONCLUSIONS: Older patients showed non-inferior compliance and equivalent pathologic complete response rates without an increased incidence of treatment complications with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. More comprehensive consideration than age alone is warranted in the decision of applying preoperative chemoradiotherapy to elderly patients with rectal cancer. Copyright © The Author 2016.

Thirty-one CT examinations were performed using ATCM and a fixed tube voltage of 80 kVp (group A). Forty-nine CT examinations were performed using a standard protocol with a tube voltage of 120 kVp and a fixed tube current time product of 40 mAs (group B).

2415,"Risk-adapted stereotactic body radiation therapy for central and ultra-central early-stage inoperable non-small cell lung cancer To determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of risk-adapted stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) schedules for patients with early-stage central and ultra-central inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

1134,"Emotional intelligence may influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy in patients with hypertension Objective: The aim of study was to definite if the emotional intelligence (EI) of patients with arterial hypertension (AH) can influence the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy. Design and method: We assessed 70 ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data of AH patients. ABPM monitor (Spacelabs 90207) was applied after the washout period. We defined daytime period as 8.00-22.00, nighttime - 0.00-6.00, and work period as 11.00-19.00. After ABPM session patients completed the emotional intelligence questionnaire (EmIn) by Lyusin D. We analyzed following EmIn scale scores: I emotion self-awareness; II management of one's own emotions; III control of emotional expression; IV understanding others' emotions; V management of others' emotions. The patients were randomized to treatment antihypertensive drugs. Then the patients were randomized to the control and intervention groups. In the control group patients were given standard recommendations for cardiovascular disease patients. In the intervention group patients were given standard recommendations and advice on lifestyle change according to the results of the EmIn questionnaire. The patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs in average therapeutic doses for 3 weeks (amlodipine, metoprolol, enalapril, telmisartan). In the absence of the therapy effectiveness, the patients began to treatment with the combined therapy, but these data were not included in the analysis. At the end of the three-week therapy was performed EmIn test and ABPM. Result(s): The mean daytime BP was (M +/- SD): systolic (SBP) - 142.1 +/- 14.5; diastolic (DBP) - 90.1 +/- 10.9 mm Hg. In each group there were 35 patients who were comparable in baseline BP, sex, age, EmIn characteristics, body mass index and drugs doses. We found that treatment with average therapeutic doses of antihypertensive drugs is not effective (table 1) in the control group. However, in the intervention group, the same doses of the drug leads to the significant BP reduction of workplace and daytime BP levels. Night BP indices in this patients did not significantly decreased (table 2). Conclusion(s): Thus, lifestyle changes, not only in according to conventional recommendations for cardiovascular patients, but also with regard of test results of emotional intelligence can enhance the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy.",Excluded
978,"Management of mandibular osteoradionecrosis corresponding to the severity of osteoradionecrosis and the method of radiotherapy PURPOSE: : To demonstrate appropriate treatment methods for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) by evaluating previous results., METHODS: : The relationship between the time interval after radiation therapy (RT) and the severity of ORN was examined. Eighty-seven patients were classified according to the extent of the lesion (grades), and the cure rates were calculated according to the RT modality, the grade, and the treatment method for ORN., RESULTS: : The later ORN developed and the higher the dose of irradiation, particularly among the patients who received external RT, the more it progressed. The initial cure rates for conservative management, marginal, and segmental mandibulectomy were 39.7%, 50%, and 86.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : Conservative management should be limited to early-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without a low dose of external irradiation. Marginal mandibulectomy is appropriate for the late-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without low-dose external irradiation. Segmental mandibulectomy is required for late-onset ORN after a high dose of external irradiation. Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 181-186, 2003",Excluded
1926,"Application of CareDose 4D combined with Karl 3D technology in the low dose computed tomography for the follow-up of COVID-19 BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by the new coronavirus. Previous studies have shown that the chest CT examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19. However, some patients with COVID-19 had low white blood cell counts and reduced lymphocyte ratios. Multiple CT examinations may cause radiation damages as well as increase the apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. A new low-dose CT method should be developed because the regular CT may aggravate the disease. METHOD(S): Sixty cases were randomly divided into the study group (n=30) and control group (n=30). The lung window was reconstructed by Karl 3D iterative technique in the study group. The image quality was subjectively evaluated by two senior chest group diagnostic physicians using a 5-point double-blind method. The value of CT measurement and its standard deviation (SD) was used as an objective evaluation criteria. The volume of CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP) and effective dose (ED) from the two groups were compared and analyzed statistically. RESULT(S): There was no significant difference in the occurrence rates of ground glass opacities, consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, fiber cable shadow and axial interstitial thickening between the study group and control group (p >0.05). In addition, no significant difference was found for the subjective score of overall image quality and image noise level (SD) between the two groups (p > 0.05). However, significant differences was found in CTDIvol, DLP, and ED between the study group and the control group (p<0.05). The effective dose of the study group was reduced by 76% compared to the control group. CONCLUSION(S): CareDose 4D low-dose scanning combined with Karl 3D iterative reconstruction technology can not only greatly reduce the radiation dose, but also provide images that meet the diagnostic criteria of COVID-19, which can be used as a routine method for the follow-up of COVID-19 patients.",Excluded
910,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
2947,"Occupational health hazards of working in the interventional laboratory: a multisite case control study of physicians and allied staff BACKGROUND: The occupational hazards of working in the interventional laboratory have been inadequately studied for physicians and remain unaddressed for nonphysician personnel., OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal pain, cancer, and other medical conditions is higher among physicians and allied staff who work in interventional laboratories compared with employees who do not., METHODS: Mayo Clinic employees who work in affiliated hospitals with interventional cardiology or interventional radiology laboratories took an electronic survey. Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

1752,"Reirradiation with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after previous radiotherapy is challenging. There is no standard approach for salvage treatment. Here we present toxicity and treatment results for recurrent NFC patients who underwent fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) as second line radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2009 and July 2012, 24 patients, with a male to female ratio of 3:1, were treated with CykerKnife R FSRT for recurrent NFC in our institution. Seven out of 24 patients had metastatic recurrent disease. Median age was 53 years (range, 20-70 years). Initial RT dose was 70Gy. The time period between initial RT and FSRT was a median of 33.2 months. The median prescription dose for FSRT was 30Gy (range, 24-30 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range, 4-6)., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 19.5 months (IQR: 12.2. -29.2 months). The locoregional control; progression free survival and overall survival (OS) rates for 1-, 2- and 3-year were 64%, 38%, 21%; 60%, 30%, 17% and 83%, 43%, 31%, respectively. Median OS for the entire cohort was 22 months (95% CI: 16.5-27.5). On multivariate analysis recurrent tumor stage was the only prognostic factor for OS (p=0.004). One patient exhibited grade III temporal lobe necrosis. One died because of grade IV mucositis and overlapping infection., CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of recurrent NPC is controversial. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is promising. However, the published trials are heterogeneous with respect to the selection criteria and treatment details. Prospective studies with long term follow-up data are warranted.",Excluded
1005,"Initial evaluation of safety of wide-field irradiation in the treatment of hematopoietic neoplasia in the cat Localized radiation therapy is well tolerated in cats with confined tumors; however, the use of wide-field radiation therapy to treat disseminated neoplasia has not been evaluated systematically in this species. Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected. In summary, wide-field external beam radiation therapy can be administered safely to, and may provide therapeutic benefit for, cats with disseminated hematopoietic neoplasia. © 2010 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.",Included
2907,"Post-transplant pulmonary function abnormalities nadir at five years and then fully normalize by the second decade in allogeneic stem cell transplantation survivors Late onset non-infectious pulmonary injury complicates >10% of allogeneic stem cell transplants (SCT), particularly in subjects conditioned with high dose Total Body Irradiation (TBI), and contributes to transplant related mortality. To characterize the kinetics of recovery from pulmonary injury in long term survivors we collected data on 138 (78 male, 60 female) subjects surviving >5 years after SCT from their HLAmatched siblings. The median age at transplant was 36 years. Transplant indications were CML (63), AML (31), MDS (19), ALL (12) and others (14). 126 subjects received mu1200 cGy TBI-based conditioning with or without lung shielding, 3 received 400 cGy TBI-based conditioning and 9 patients received no irradiation. Ex vivo T cell depleted grafts were given to 131 recipients, except for six who received a nonmyeloablative SCT. Of the 138 long term survivors, 26 had no cGvHD, 70 had cGvHD lasting less than 3 years; and 42 had prolonged cGvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression for > 3 years. Among the 17 patients who died after 5 years, 4 died of pulmonary causes, including two with lung cancer. Pre-transplant abnormalities (< 80% predicted) in PFTs were found in 15.9% of subjects in the following declining frequency: FVC%, VC, TLC, FEV1, DLCO Adj (adjusted for hemoglobin and alveolar ventilation) Hb/VA and FEV1/FVC. Baseline (BL) PFTs served as the reference for all subsequent measurements at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years for each survivor. The only parameter showing a clinically significant decline post transplant was DLCO Adj which reached a nadir at 5 years, with subsequent normalization at the 10 year mark [paired ttest]. An abnormal (<80% of baseline) DLCO Adj was found in 19.6, 21.0, 0.7 and 0% of survivors at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years. The mean DLCO Adj at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years were 91% (P = .003), 88% (P < .001), 98% (p=NS) and 100% (p=NS) of BL, respectively. Multivariable modeling (forward-stepwise multiple regression) identified the presence of chronic GVHD (P = .017) and abnormal Baseline DLCO Adj (P = .023) as the only significant factors associated with the decline in DLCO Adj at 5 years but excluded smoking, conditioning intensity, baseline C-reactive protein level, TBI dose to the lungs and demographic variables. In conclusion, DLCO Adj is the only PFT marker associated with pulmonary injury in our TBI-conditioned transplant population. DLCO Adj nadirs at 5 years post-SCT, and normalizes by 10 years. Chronic GVHD and pre-transplant DLCO Adj are important contributory factors to the decline in DLCO Adj. (Figure presented).",Excluded
159,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves deglutition in Parkinson's disease Relatively little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in human deglutition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) affords us a model for examining deglutition in humans with known impairment of the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of subthalamic nuclei (STN) DBS on the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of normal"" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.

1536,"Evaluation of acoustic radiation force impulse imaging for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant liver tumors BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is a novel radiation force-based imaging modality for the evaluation of the tissue stiffness. It can provide measurement of tissue stiffness with shear wave velocity that depends on the tissue stiffness. It has been utilized for the evaluation of liver fibrosis of chronic liver diseases. However, it is still uncertain whether ARFI imaging can be applied for the differentiation of liver tumors. The aim of this study is to examine whether ARFI elastography can differentiate benign and malignant liver tumors. METHOD(S): Forty-four patients of liver tumors were enrolled. Eighteen cases (14 men, 4 women; mean age 61.4 years) were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 20 cases (6 men, 14 women; mean age 57.0 years) were cavernous hemangioma, and 6 cases (;4men,2women,mean age 62.8years) were metastatic liver tumor. The underlying diagnosis of these liver tumors was established with CE-MDCT, CE-MRI, and/or US-guided tumor biopsy. All patients were underwent ARFI elastography using a Siemens Acuson S2000. The velocity of the shear wave from the liver tumors was calculated as the average value of six trials. RESULT(S): The average velocities of the shear wave of HCC, cavernous hemangioma, and metastatic liver tumor were 2.08 +/-0.62m/s, 1.56+/-0.64m/s, and 2.42+/-1.05m/s, respectively. The average velocities of the shear wave of HCC and metastatic liver tumor were significantly higher than that of cavernous hemangioma (p <0.05, Mann- Whitney test). But no significant difference was observed between those of HCC and metastatic liver tumor. It is noteworthy that although the primary tumors of the 6 cases of metastatic liver tumors were varied (2 pancreas cancers, urinary bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, and lung cancer), the average velocity of the metastatic liver tumors of these cancers was significantly higher than that of cavernous hemangioma. In addition, the average of velocity of the shear wave of the liver bearing HCC (1.68+/-0.42m/s) was significantly higher (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test) than those of the livers bearing cavernous hemangioma (1.08+/-0.27m/s) and metastatic liver tumor (1.13+/-0.27m/s), consisting with that patients of HCC are accompanied with chronic hepatic diseases.

225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded
3351,"Comparison of 18f-fluoride PET/MR and PET/CT in patients with chronic foot pain Aim: To evaluate the feasibility and value of 18F-Fluoride positron-emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (18F-Fluoride PET/MR) compared to 18FFluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-Fluoride PET/CT) imaging in patients with chronic foot pain. Material(s) and Method(s): Twentytwo patients (9 men, 13 women; mean age 48 +/-18 years) were prospectively included in this study and underwent a single injection, dual imaging protocol with 18FFluoride PET/CT (Siemens Biograph 64) and PET/MR (Siemens Biograph mMR). PET/MR protocol included at least T1w SE and PD fs sequences in two planes each with simultaneous acquisition of PET over 20 min. PET/CT included a native isotropic (0.6 mm) diagnostic CT (120 kV, 90 mAs) and a subsequent PET (3 min per BP). Two blinded readers assessed in consensus randomly both PET datasets concerning image quality (three-point scale) and for the presence of focal lesions with increased 18F-Fluoride uptake (maximum of 4 lesions). For each dataset (PET/CT vs. PET/MR) the main diagnoses were defined by using both PET and morphological dataset. Correlations were performed using linear correlation. Result(s): Image quality was rated highly diagnostic for both PET datasets. However, with a mean rating of 3.0/3 for PET/MR and 2.3/3 for PET/CT, image quality was statistically significant superior for PET/MR (p<0.0001). Sensitivity of the PET datasets in PET/MR and PET/CT were equivalent with the same 42 lesions with focal 18F-Fluoride uptake. In PET/MR mean SUV mean was 10.4 [2.0-67.7] and mean SUV max 15.6 [2.9-94.1], corresponding mean SUV mean of PET/CT was 10.2 [1.8-55.6] and mean SUV max 16.3 [2.5-117.5], resulting in a high linear correlation coefficient (correlation coefficient r = 0.96, p<0.0001 for SUV mean and r = 0.96, p<0.0001 for SUV max). A final consensus reading revealed as main diagnoses osteoarthritis (n=11), stress fracture (n=7), stress reaction with bone marrow edema, (n= 4), chondrogenic tumor (n= 1), aneurysmatic bone cyst (n= 1), anterolateral impingement (n=1) and osteochondral lesion (n=1). Hereby, PET/CT was more precise in visualizing degeneration, while PET/MR was more specific in non-degenerative pathologies due to the higher soft-tissue and bone marrow contrast. Conclusion(s):18F-Fluoride PET/MR is more conclusive than PET/CT in patients suffering from chronic foot pain other than osteoarthritis. There was a high correlation between the SUV mean/max of focal foot lesions comparing PET/CT and PET/MR despite using different attenuation techniques. As image quality of PET/MR was superior to PET/CT due to the longer acquisition time, future PET/MR only studies would potentially allow 18F-Fluoride dose reduction.",Excluded
1845,"Epidemiology of lung cancer in women: A hospital-based descriptive study Objective: Lung cancer required much greater attention as it is the most common cause of death. According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded
913,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas? Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included
2499,"An assessment of the adequacy of sunscreen usage Sunscreens are in widespread use as a form of skin protection against solar ultraviolet radiation. Previous studies provide some data to show that the amount of sunscreen applied is less than manufacturers' recommendations, although studies have often used indirect measurement techniques. This study comprised 50 volunteers who applied a standard aqueous cream as a hypoallergenic analogue for sunscreen to one of their forearms. Two novel methods of directly measuring forearm area were used, based on a mathematical model and the use of a helically wrapped cloth belt. Application amounts ranged from 0.05 mg.cm-2 to 8.38 mg.cm-2. The distribution was heavily skewed, with a modal value in the range 0.5-1.0 mg.cm-2. Of the volunteers 69% applied less than the generally accepted quantity of 2.0 mg.cm-2, with 61% applying less than 1.5 mg.cm-2, and 37% applying less than 1.0 mg.cm-2. The study confirms previous findings that most sunscreen application is not sufficient to achieve the stated sun protection factor. The use of higher factor sunscreens, a reassessment of the definition of sun protection factors and/or further public education campaigns are warranted.",Excluded
9,"Integration of magnetoencephalography-generated functional brain maps into dose planning during arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can delineate critical regions of the cortex and facilitate conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose planning. Despite the substantial role of Gamma Knife R SRS in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management, MEG-generated maps of critical regions have never been utilized to improve dose planning., PURPOSE: To assess the value of integrating functional brain mapping using MEG with dose planning during treatment of brain AVMs with SRS., METHODS: This case series encompassed 5 patients with motor region AVMs. Noninvasive eloquent cortex mapping was achieved using a whole-head 306-channel Neuromag R Vectorview MEG System 5-10 days before SRS. On the day of SRS, the functional brain maps were integrated onto the intraoperative dose planning magnetic resonance imaging for Leksell GammaPlan R version 10. The median AVM volume treated was 12.7 cm(3), and 18 Gy was the median margin dose., RESULTS: Functional image integration of MEG improved the recognition of critical brain structures adjacent to the AVM. This facilitated anatomical planning designed to reduce the dose to adjacent critical structures while maintaining a therapeutic dose to the AVM target. The 5 patients had no adverse radiation effects during the follow-up., CONCLUSION: Coregistration of MEG data improves the accuracy and dose sparing needed for optimal planning during Gamma Knife SRS.

735,"Waiting times for radiotherapy: variation over time and between cancer networks in southeast England The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the length of time that patients with cancer wait from diagnosis to treatment with radiotherapy. A total of 57,426 men and 71,018 women diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2001 and receiving radiotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry database. In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%. There was no difference between male and female patients after adjustment for the other factors, particularly site. There was a highly significant trend over time: the median wait increased from 45 days in 1992 to 76 days in 2001, while the adjusted proportion being treated within 60 days declined by almost a half, from 64 to 35%, over the same period.",Excluded
1794,"Determination of physical parameters associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic low back pain BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy that is associated with various pain-related disabilities such as chronic low back pain (LBP), should be questioned besides physical assessments. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the physical factors associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic LBP. METHOD(S): One hundred nine patients diagnosed as chronic mechanic LBP (65 females, 44 males) between 20-50 years old were included to this study. The intensity of LBP was assessed by using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale. For musculoskeletal fitness measurement; muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility tests were applied. Functional Reach Test for balance evaluation, Self-Efficacy Scale for self-efficacy measurement, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for disability level evaluation were used. RESULT(S): We found a moderate negative correlation between self-efficacy and pain intensity (r=-0.506); a negative and strong correlation between self-efficacy and disability level (r=-0.654) (p< 0.05). Self efficacy had a significant association with right (r= 0.265) and left (r= 0.290) lateral side bending flexibility (p< 0.05). According to multiple regression analysis results, it was found that disability level had a significant effect on self-efficacy (beta=-2.014; p< 0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Poor musculoskeletal fitness and pain intensity may cause decreasing self-efficacy but the major determinant of decreased self-efficacy was low-back related disability scores.Copyright © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

1146,"Radiotherapy in cancer tongue base: Use of 'half beam shielding blocks' technique with 60Co. Personal experience Background. The results obtained in the treatment of tongue base carcinomas using gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit and 'half beam shielding blocks' technique are reported. Methods. From January 1988 through December 1995, 69 patients affected with tongue base carcinoma were treated with radiation therapy at the Radiotherapy Department of Umberto I Hospital in Mestre, Italy. The patients were mostly males (M:F=4.75:1), their age ranging from 39-85 years (mean: 64.2 years). Staging, performed according to TNM classification (UICC criteria) showed 17 cases in stage II, 19 in stage III and 33 in stage IV, with prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma. Seventeen patients were treated with radical surgery. All patients were treated with radiotherapy with gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit and using the 'half beam shielding blocks' technique and junction level on the hyoid axis. Treatment planning was always studied on an extensive number of CT scans on which target volume and normal tissues were defined and performed using Theraplan V05 program, Theratronics. The dose to the target volume was 50 Gy/25 fractions after radical surgery and 60 Gy/30 fractions for exclusive radiotherapy and after non radical surgery. Results. Overall 3-years and 5- years survival were 39% and 31% respectively (+/-0.0668), disease free 5-years survival was 39%. A better prognosis for initial stage lesions with statistically significant difference (p-value=0.0116), and for patients treated with radical surgery plus radiography (p-value=0.008) was obtained. Fifty-four patients obtained a complete remission; the other fifteen a partial remission. Twenty-one patients showed loco-regional relapse; thirty- six died, thirty of them with disease. Conclusions. The data obtained show that the 'half beam shielding blocks' technique can be used also with gamma photon of a Cobalt Unit, and that the local control wasn't obtained using the conventional doses and radiotherapy technique. Better results should be obtained using new radiotherapy techniques and new combined approaches.",Excluded
2385,"Arthroscopic removal of arch-shaped rotator cuff calcifying tendinitis without rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty is an excellent treatment regarding pain relief and function Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcome for arthroscopic removal of calcium deposit without acromioplasty and rotator cuff repair for patients with ultrasound-diagnosed arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff (type I), homogenic (x-ray) with chronic pain. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients with homogenous, arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis, suffering from chronic pain and who underwent arthroscopic treatment and 50 patients with the same type of tendinitis treated conservatively. All patients had calcium deposit located in supraspinatus tendon, pre-operatively and post-operatively evaluated by ultrasound. Clinical outcome was assessed by using Quick DASH, UCLA, and VAS score. Result(s): There were 29 male and 71 female patients; none had bilateral involvement. We divided patients into group A-operatively treated-and group B-conservatively treated-by shock wave therapy. Patients from group A had higher improvement of all used tests, QDash (from 19.3 to 2.7), UCLA (from 10 to 34), and VAS score (from 3 to 0) when compared with group B. Conclusion(s): Patients with arch-shaped calcium deposits and acoustic shadow have better results after arthroscopic treatment than the conservative one. There was no need for acromioplasty or tendon repair.

54,"Effects on human skin of repetitive ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) irradiation and visible light Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a variety of effects on human skin. Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that suberythemal doses of UVA1 and even visible light may cause DNA damage.",Excluded
3105,"Endocrine function and reproductive impairment in an irradiated population of the lizard Uta stansburiana This study describes gonadal changes in lizards (Uta stansburiana) exposed to chronic low levels of gamma radiation (1.5-10 R/day) under field conditions and attempts to evaluate endocrine involvement in these changes. Reproductive impairment in irradiated males is demonstrated during the breeding season by reduced testes weights and by seminiferous tubules devoid of germ cells. Ultrastructural morphology of Leydig cells, plasma testosterone levels, and developed accessory sex structures indicate normal steroidogenesis in such males; cytology of the pituitary gonadotropes and pituitary gonadotropin content indicate normal gonadotropin levels. These findings suggest that low levels of radiation affect the spermatogenic process directly, rather than through damage to the pituitary. Comparable irradiation causes complete resorption of ovarian tissue in some female Uta. The oviducts are atrophic and the pituitary gonadotropes hyperactive. Resemblance of gonadotropes to those of castrated animals and reduced pituitary hormone content suggest elevated levels of gonadotropin production, probably due to the absence of ovarian steroid feedback in affected animals. The continued mitotic activity of oogonia in adult reptiles and their limited number contribute to the vulnerability of germinal tissue in irradiated female lizards. Destruction of the germ cells is accompanied by resorption of all ovarian tissue including steroidogenic elements. Thus, in females as in males, radiation appears to damage gametogenesis rather than pituitary function.",Excluded

The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.

873,"Experiences of xerostomia after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A qualitative study AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions. The healthcare system requires a symptom management platform for radiation-induced complications, to help patients, their families and healthcare professionals obtain information about self-care, treatments and relief strategies.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) when used for patients with intractable cluster headache (CH). Methods. Four participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 17 patients who underwent GKS for intractable CH between 1996 and 2008. The median patient age was 47 years (range 26-83 years). The median duration of pain before GKS was 10 years (range 1.3-40 years). Seven patients underwent unsuccessful prior surgical procedures, including microvascular decompression (2 patients), microvascular decompression with glycerol rhizotomy (2 patients), deep brain stimulation (1 patient), trigeminal ganglion stimulation (1 patient), and prior GKS (1 patient). Fourteen patients had associated autonomic symptoms. The radiosurgical target was the trigeminal nerve (TN) root and the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in 8 patients, only the TN in 8 patients, and only the SPG in 1 patient. The median maximum TN and SPG dose was 80 Gy. Results. Favorable pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute Grades I-IIIb) was achieved and maintained in 10 (59%) of 17 patients at a median follow-up of 34 months. Three patients required additional procedures (repeat GKS in 2 patients, hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in 1 patient). Eight (50%) of 16 patients who had their TN irradiated developed facial sensory dysfunction after GKS. Conclusions. Gamma Knife surgery for intractable, medically refractory CH provided lasting pain reduction in approximately 60% of patients, but was associated with a significantly greater chance of facial sensory disturbances than GKS used for trigeminal neuralgia.",Excluded

2582,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included
2716,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance? It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included

The aim of the study is to assess recently released web based software, ""Click2correct"" during preoperative planning of patients with lower extremity trauma. The angular deformity and length measurements of fractured bones is highly dependent to taken reference points. The new proposed system offer easy tools for standardization in determination of reference points, which were aimed to tested in the present study. Material(s) and Method(s): Twentyfour patients (eight females and sixteen males) with lower extremity fracture were admitted sequentially to orthopaedics and traumatology department of the same university. All patients were examined with direct x rays. The from fracture distorted and deformed bones were assessed with measurement tools of the PACS system of the Hospital. The radiographs were also uploaded to the click2correct web site. The angular deormity and leg length changes were also assessed by two researchers. The accuracy, and reliability were tested statistically between researchers and their measurements. Result(s): There were found positive correlations interobservers and intraoberver measurements in terms of assesment of angular deformity and shortening of fractured bones. Before decision of treatment modality the positional analysis of fractured bone parts of tibia and femurs has to be evaluated. The preoperative planning softwares aims to ease these procedure. The recently released software announced web based working solution as an advantage. Also new tools were offered during determination of reference points during measurement for standardization. The present study has found consistency between measurements. Furthermore virtual fracture reduction facility, which also guides in proper implant selection and placement was found useful.

Our study aim was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a noise reduction technology (NRT) on patient radiation dose during CTO PCI. A total of 187 CTO PCIs performed between February 2016 and May 2017 were analyzed according to the angiographic systems utilized: Standard (n = 60) versus NRT (n = 127). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for differences in baseline characteristics. Primary endpoints were Cumulative Air Kerma at Interventional Reference Point (AK at IRP), which correlates with patient's tissue reactions; and Kerma Area Product (KAP), a surrogate measure of patient's risk of stochastic radiation effects. An Efficiency Index (defined as fluoroscopy time/AK at IRP) was calculated for each procedure. Image quality was evaluated using a 5-grade Likert-like scale. After PSM, n = 55 pairs were identified. Baseline and angiographic characteristics were well matched between groups. Compared to the Standard system, NRT was associated with lower AK at IRP [2.38 (1.80-3.66) vs. 3.24 (2.04-5.09) Gy, p = 0.035], a trend towards reduction for KAP [161 (93-244) vs. 203 (136-363) Gycm2, p = 0.069], and a better Efficiency Index [16.75 (12.73-26.27) vs. 13.58 (9.92-17.63) min/Gy, p = 0.003]. Image quality was similar between the two groups (4.39 +/- 0.53 Standard vs. 4.34 +/- 0.47 NRT, p = 0.571).

Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty consecutive patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy for Stage III/IV head and neck cancer to a median dose of 70 Gy (range, 64-74 Gy). The most common primary site was the oropharynx (66 patients). Sixty-seven patients (56%) were treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Seventy patients (58%) received prophylactic GT placement at the discretion of the physician before initiation of chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): Prophylactic GT placement significantly reduced weight loss during radiation therapy from 43 pounds (range, 0 to 76 pounds) to 19 pounds (range, 0 to 51 pounds), which corresponded to a net change of -14% (range, 0% to -30%) and -8% (range, +1% to -22%) from baseline, respectively (p < 0.001). However, the proportion of patients who were GT-dependent at 6- and 12-months after treatment was 41% and 21%, respectively, compared with 8% and 0%, respectively, for those with and without prophylactic GT (p < 0.001). Additionally, prophylactic GT was associated with a significantly higher incidence of late esophageal stricture compared with those who did not have prophylactic GT (30% vs. 6%, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Although prophylactic GT placement was effective at preventing acute weight loss and the need for intravenous hydration, it was also associated with significantly higher rates of late esophageal toxicity. The benefits of this strategy must be balanced with the risks. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3060,"A comparison of neuron response properties in areas A1 and CM of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex: tones and broadband noise The purpose of this study was to compare response properties of two adjacent areas of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex. Multiunit responses to 50 ms tones and broadband noise bursts (BBN) were recorded in the core area, A1, and the caudomedial belt area, CM, of ketamine-anesthetized animals. Neurons in A1 and CM exhibited robust low-threshold short-latency responses to BBN and tones, whereas neurons in adjoining lateral belt areas were poorly responsive or unresponsive to tones and noise. Except for a population of broadly tuned units in CM, the characteristic frequency (CF) could be determined for all recording sites in A1 and CM. Both areas were tonotopically organized and shared a high CF border. Whereas the tonotopic gradient in A1 was smooth and continuous across the field, the gradient in CM was discontinuous, and the intermediate CF range was underrepresented. For BBN stimuli, rate level functions were largely monotonic in A1 and CM. Response profiles were also similar in both areas. As a population, neurons in CM were distinguished from A1 by significantly shorter response latencies, lower thresholds, and broader tuning bandwidth at higher intensities. The results indicated that, while A1 and CM represent anatomically and physiologically distinct areas, their response profiles under anesthesia overlapped considerably compared with the lateral belt areas. Therefore refinements of current models of the primate auditory cortex may be needed to account for differences in organization among the auditory belt areas.",Excluded
525,"[Therapy of radiation enteritis--current challenges] Radiation enteritis is one of the most feared complications after abdominal and pelvic radiation therapy. The incidence varies from 0.5 to 5%. It is not rare that the slowly progressing condition will be fatal. During a period of 13 years 24 patients were operated due to the complication of radiation enteritis. Despite different types of surgery repeated operation was required in 25% of cases and finally 4 patients died. Analyzing these cases predisposing factors and different therapeutic options of this condition are discussed. Treatment options of radiation induced enteritis are limited; however, targeted therapy significantly improves the outcome. Cooperation between oncologist, gastroenterologist and surgeon is required to establish adequate therapeutic plan.",Excluded
192,"Apparent migration of implantable port devices: normal variations in consideration of BMI PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded
2315,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

1488,"Population-based outcomes by immunosuppressed status in patients undergoing radiotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer Introduction: The incidence of immunosuppression in patients with oropharynx head & neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is not well studied. This study evaluates disease characteristics and treatment outcomes in oropharynx SCC in patients with and without immunosuppression. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients treated with radiotherapy for oropharynx SCC at BC Cancer from 2011 to 2016 was performed. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and competing risk analysis. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed. Result(s): There were 1077 patients, of which 5.8% (n = 62) had an immunosuppressive medical condition or were taking long-term immunosuppressive medication at diagnosis. Median follow-up was 3.3 years. Three year OS for patients without immunosuppression was 79.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 76.8-82.0%) and for those with immunosuppression was 64.6% (95% CI 50.9-75.3%) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.68, p = 0.0062). The three year disease recurrence for patients without immunosuppression was 24.9% (95% CI 22.2-27.7%) and 44.4% (95% CI 31.5-56.6%) for those with immunosuppression (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.45-3.11, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of disease free survival (DFS) found that active smoking, advanced TNM stage, base of tongue subsite, p16 negative and unknown, no concurrent chemotherapy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and lower radiation dose were also associated with worse DFS (all p < 0.05). Immunosuppressed patients had worse DFS relative to patients without immunosuppression, p < 0.001, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.33-2.91). Conclusion(s): Immunosuppression was an independent predictor of worse DFS in this large cohort of patients with oropharynx SCC.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1203,"Ultrasmall WS2 Quantum Dots with Visible Fluorescence for Protection of Cells and Animal Models from Radiation-Induced Damages Two-dimensional WS2 materials have attracted wide attention in condensed physics and materials science due to its unique geometric and electronic structures. Particularly, WS2 shows extraordinary catalytic activities when its size decreases to ultrasmall, which provides potential opportunities for medical applications. In this work, WS2 quantum dots with strong catalytic properties were used for in vitro and in vivo protection from ionizing radiation induced cell damages. WS2 quantum dots possess unique optical properties of blue photoluminescence emission and excitation-wavelength dependent emission profiles. In vitro studies showed that cell viability can be considerably improved and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be removed by WS2 quantum dots. In vivo studies showed WS2 quantum dots can effectively protect the hematopoietic system and DNA from damages caused by high-energy radiation through removing whole-body excessive ROS. Furthermore, WS2 quantum dots showed nearly 80% renal clearance within 24 h post injection and did not cause any obvious toxicities in up to 30 days after treatment.Copyright © 2017 American Chemical Society.",Excluded
3414,"Imaging in Patients with Crohn's Disease: Trends in Abdominal CT/MRI Utilization and Radiation Exposure Considerations over a 10-Year Period Purpose: To study the trends in utilization of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with Crohn's disease and to evaluate changes in CT radiation exposure over a 10-year period. Method(s): In this institutional review board-approved single-institution retrospective study, we included patients who underwent CT and MRIs for evaluation of Crohn's disease between 2006 and 2015. A total of 3196 CTs and 1924 MR scans were performed in 2156 patients (mean age: 34.8 +/- 17.71 yr; range: 3-91 yr) for initial diagnosis or follow-up of Crohn's disease between 2006 and 2015. Trends in CT/MR utilization was assessed by comparing the volume of CT/MRI studies performed each year. The changes in CT radiation exposure over the study period were estimated and compared. Result(s): The annual combined CT/MR utilization demonstrated a 1.9-fold rise over the last decade (2006: n = 358, 2015: n = 681, P < 0.001, r = 0.96). It was predominantly because of a substantial growth (9.2-fold increase) in the MR scan volume (2006: n = 37, 2015: n = 341, P < 0.001, r = 0.93), whereas CT volume did not show significant change (2006: n = 321, 2015: n = 340, P = 0.6). Over this same period, there was a 59.4% reduction in mean radiation exposure (2006: CT dose index vol 16.9 +/- 7.1 mGy, 2015: CT dose index vol 6.87 +/- 4.62 mGy, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): A 9-fold growth in annual MR scan volume contributed to a nearly 2-fold rise in yearly cross-sectional imaging utilization in Crohn's patients between 2006 and 2015. Rising trend in imaging utilization paralleled a 60% reduction of CT radiation exposure.Copyright © 2017 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.",Excluded

2892,"Tumorigenicity of human malignant lymphoblasts: comparative study with unmanipulated nude mice, antilymphocyte serum-treated nude mice, and X-irradiated nude mice The ability of unmanipulated, antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated, and X-irradiated nude BALB/c female mice (in their 13th backcross generation) to serve as hosts for 10 human lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as for peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy humans was compared. The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included
1341,"[UV risk perception by the general public: results of a representative questionnaire in Germany] For public health promotion purposes it is important to know how the general public perceives the risk factor ""UV exposure"" and how UV risk perception is connected to health-related attitudes and beliefs. The aim of the study was to collect representative data about UV risk perception in Germany. A representative telephone survey using the ADM design was carried out among 1 501 German residents between May and July 2007. Variables related to UV risk knowledge, relevance of risk topics in every-day thinking and risk estimates were investigated. Data regarding a subjective benefit evaluation of UV exposition was also collected. The results suggest no essential gaps in the general knowledge about UV risks, except for the underestimation of UV-related cataracts. The respondents thought it extremely likely that UV exposure would cause health damage such as skin cancer, photoaging or sun burns. People were asked to report how often they had thought about a number of health risks including UV risks in the last two weeks. It was established that UV risks are present but not dominant in people's every-day thinking. Along with it, the risk evaluation proves to be rather moderate. The mean value for respondents' perceived personal risk is M=5.1, in the midsection of the given 10-point scale. The results show that perceived personal risk is not influenced by the serious UV health risks such as cancer or cataracts. The results also indicate that UV benefit and UV risk perception are not strongly related to one another. In summary, participants' perception and assessment of the various health risks of UV exposure seem to be realistic, but the UV risk assessment it is not related to the perception of personal risk. One must therefore assume that UV health risk information and education campaigns do not necessarily lead to a change in the perception of personal UV risk. Rather than addressing primarily risk knowledge, UV risk communication should focus more on motivational aspects and consider the role of UV benefit perception. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Method(s): Nine patients with LRRC were treated with salvage HDR-ISBT. Their median age was 63 years. The median maximum diameter of LRRC was 40 mm (range 20-80 mm). Adenocarcinomas were histologically confirmed in all cases. The prescribed dose was 30 Gy/5 fractions/3 days to 50 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the combined external-beam radiotherapy group (four patients) and 54 Gy/9 fractions/5 days to 60 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the monotherapeutic group (five patients). Median follow-up time was 90 months (range 6-221 months). Result(s): Local control at final follow-up was achieved in five of nine patients. Of these five patients, one experienced a locally re-recurrent tumor in the vaginal wall 33 months after treatment and received re-HDR-ISBT as re-salvage treatment. The 8-year overall survival, local control, and progression-free survival rates were 56, 44, and 33 %, respectively.

2112,"The use of an air bubble curtain to reduce the received sound levels for harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) In December 2005 construction work was started to replace a harbor wall in Kerteminde harbor, Denmark. A total of 175 wooden piles were piled into the ground at the waters edge over a period of 3 months. During the same period three harbor porpoises were housed in a marine mammal facility on the opposite side of the harbor. All animals showed strong avoidance reactions after the start of the piling activities. As a measure to reduce the sound exposure for the animals an air bubble curtain was constructed and operated in a direct path between the piling site and the opening of the animals' semi-natural pool. The sound attenuation effect achieved with this system was determined by quantitative comparison of pile driving impulses simultaneously measured in front of and behind the active air bubble curtain. Mean levels of sound attenuation over a sequence of 95 consecutive pile strikes were 14 dB (standard deviation (s.d.) 3.4 dB) for peak to peak values and 13 dB (s.d. 2.5 dB) for SEL values.

3231,"Influence of image acquisition on radiation dose and image quality: Full versus narrow phase window acquisition using 320 MDCT Purpose. To compare radiation dose and image quality using predefined narrow phase window versus complete phase window with dose modulation during R-R using 320-row MDCTA. Methods. 114 patients underwent coronary CTA study using 320-row MDCT scanner. 87 patients with mean age (61 + 13 years), mean BMI (29 + 6), and mean heart rate (HR) (58 + 7 bpm) were imaged at predefined 66-80% R-R interval and then reconstructed at 75% while 27 patients with mean age (63 + 16 years), mean BMI (28 + 5), and mean HR (57 + 7 bpm) were scanned throughout the complete R-R interval with tube current modulation. The effective dose (ED) was calculated from dose length product (DLP) and conversion k (0.014 mSv/mGy/cm). Image quality was assessed using a three-point ordinal scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, and 3 = nondiagnostic). Results. Both groups were statistically similar to each other with reference of HR (P=0.59), BMI (P=0.17), and tube current mAs (P=0.68). The median radiation dose was significantly higher in those scanned with complete R-R phase window versus narrow phase window (P<0.0001). Independently of patient and scan parameters, increased phase window was associated with higher radiation dose (P<0.001). Image quality was better among those scanned with narrow phase window versus complete phase window (P<0.0001). Conclusion. Our study supports that good HR control and predefined narrow window acquisition result in lower radiation dose without compromising diagnostic image quality for coronary disease evaluation. © 2013 Faisal Khosa et al.",Excluded
3216,"Efficacy of narrowband UVB vs. PUVA in patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides INTRODUCTION: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of the skin that often begins as limited patches and plaques with slow progression to systemic involvement. Narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B therapy has been proven to be an effective short-term treatment modality for clearing patch-stage MF. The effect of psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet A (PUVA) in the treatment of patch- and plaque-type MF has also been thoroughly documented., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of narrowband UVB and PUVA in patients with early-stage MF., METHODS: We analysed the response to treatment, relapse-free survival and irradiation dose in 114 patients with histologically confirmed early-stage MF (stage IA, IB and IIA)., RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were treated with PUVA (83.3%) and 19 with narrowband UVB (16.7%). With PUVA, 59 patients (62.1%) had a complete response (CR), 24 (25.3%) had a partial response (PR) and 12 (12.6%) had a failed response. Narrowband UVB led to CR in 12 (68.4%) patients, PR in 5 (26.3%) patients and a failed response in 1 (5.3%) patient. There were no differences in terms of time to relapse between patients treated with PUVA and those treated with narrowband UVB (11.5 vs. 14.0 months respectively; P = 0.816). No major adverse reactions were attributed to the treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that phototherapy is a safe, effective and well-tolerated, first-line therapy in patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with prolonged disease-free remissions being achieved. It suggests that narrowband UVB is at least as effective as PUVA for treatment of early-stage MF.",Excluded

This study aims to determine the safe dose constraints to the heart's subregions that could prevent patients' early non-cancerous death and improve their quality of life. Methods and Materials: A retrospective cohort study was performed containing 51 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and treated using 3D, Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy. For a dosimetric analysis, these structures were chosen: heart, heart base (HB), and region of great blood vessels (GBV). Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were recorded for all mentioned structures. Maximum and mean doses to the heart, HB, the muscle mass of the HB, and GBV were obtained. V10-V60 (%) parameters were calculated from the DVH. After performed statistical analysis, logistic regression models were created, and critical doses calculated. Result(s): The critical dose for developing a fatal endpoint for HB was 30.5 Gy, while for GBV, it was 46.3 Gy. Increasing the average dose to the HB or GBV by 1 Gy from the critical dose further increases the possibility of early death by 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We suggest that the non-canonical sub-regions of the heart (HB and GBV) should be considered during the planning stage. Additional constraints of the heart subregions should be chosen accordingly, and we propose that the mean doses to these regions be 30.5 Gy and 46.3 Gy, respectively, or less.

Design and method: A total of 126 HD patients (74m 52w; average age 61.5+/-15.8) were enrolled. All patients were dialysed by European and KDIGO guidelines. ABPM (24-hours) was performed with SpaceLab 90207 after mid-week dialysis; pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) were measured using Arteriograph after mid-week dialysis. Malnutritioninflammation score (MIS) and protein energy wasting (PEW) score were calculated in all enrolled patients. There were 67.6% of patients without prior CV disease, and prior coronary heart disease, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were diagnosed in 7.1%, 5,6%, 4.7%, 8.7%, 3.9% patients, respectively. Prior diabetes and prior hypertension were diagnosed in 26.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Result(s): There were 74.6% of non-dippers, while white coat hypertension and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 25.4% and 7.9%, respectively. During the follow up period of 48 months 69 patients died from all-cause and 53 from CV mortality. Diurnal variations of blood pressure were not associated with all-cause mortality. Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology.

All PF and EF diameters were well-discriminated for prediction of metabolic syndrome in ROC analysis (AUC values, from 0.696 to 0.795). Conclusion(s): RPF diameter at low-dose chest CT would be a simple method for prediction of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2018, Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
2667,"Targeted therapy for metastatic kidney cancer at a urologic outpatient clinic: Experience of partly nurse administrated treatment Introduction and Objectives: Since 2006 patients from Gothenburg with metastatic kidney cancer have been treated with targeted therapy at the outpatient clinic of the Urologic department, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Therapy was started by a senior urologist and thereafter administrated by two specialized nurses conducting frequent visits for handing out medicine, blood checks, weight and blood pressure controls, patient education and tending of side effects. The responsible doctor was contacted when adjustment of the treatment was needed. All medicine was handed to the patients to ensure that a minimum of the drugs were wasted. Visits to the doctors were conducted every 4th to 6th month mostly at the time of X-ray or when needed. The objective of the study was to report our experience with targeted therapy at a urologic outpatient clinic performed as partly nurse administered. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2006 and 2012, 82 patients in total were treated with targeted therapy and registered in a database. All treatment and survival data were recorded. There were 56 men and 26 women. Result(s): Eighty-two patients were treated in first line. Treatment time on targeted therapy ranged from 9 days to 3 years and 10 months (median 11.5 months). In the first line 58 (71%) of the patients had sunitinib, 13 (16%) sorafenib, 7 (8%) bevacizumab+interferon, 3 (4%) pazopanib and 1 (1%) had temsirolimus. Thirty-four treatments were started in the second line. Ten treatments were given in the third and 2 in the fourth line. In 2012 33 patients were treated. During that year 213 visits were conducted by the specialized nurses and 54 visits by a senior urologist. Conclusion(s): A partly nurse administrated outpatient treatment with targeted therapy is possible when performed in close contact with the responsible doctor. It makes it possible to follow up the patients with short intervals and provides a close contact which they can always turn to with the numerous problems these patients have without consuming too much of doctor time.",Excluded
2325,"Analysis of entrance surface dose in general radiographies using body mass index classification Dose audit is an important topic in radiology and variations in dose attributable to sex have not been fully investigated. The primary purpose of our study was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) for men and women, from which we established an easy estimation equation for ESD, using the body mass index (BMI) as a variable. From April 2000 to March 2002, 15424 patients (8586 men, 6838 women; mean age, 58 years old; age range, 20 to 90 years old) were recruited in this study. Estimated equation of ESD was obtained from the dispersion data of BMI and ESD. Welch's t-test was used as the test of significance. P values evaluated levels of significance at 5%. Analysis for correlation coefficients was used for Peason's correlation coefficient test. And, we also performed a simple regression analysis. The results of the simple regression equation with BMI as variable (y: ESD [mGy], x: BMI [kg/m(2)), and the median values of ESD were as follows: for chest PA, men, 0.22, y = 0.0145 x - 0.0876, women, 0.20, y = 0.0126 x - 0.0704; for abdomen AP, men, 2.12, y = 0.2707 x - 3.7206, women, 1.65, y = 0.2561 x - 3.7989; for pelvis AP, men, 1.87, y = 0.0517 x + 0.8753, women, 1.77, y = 0.0674 x + 0.4775; for lumbar spine AP, men, 3.08, y = 0.3462 x - 4.1416, women, 2.66, y = 0.2525 x - 2.8131; and for lumbar spine lateral, men, 9.31, y = 0.6012 x - 3.7216, women, 7.42, y = 0.3147 x + 0.3384. The results of ESD had a significant difference between sexes (P < 0.05).

75,"Targeted alpha particle immunotherapy for myeloid leukemia Unlike beta particle-emitting isotopes, a emitters can selectively kill individual cancer cells with a single atomic decay. HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters 131I and 90Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope 213Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg 213Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the 213Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts. This study demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and antileukemic effects of 213Bi-HuM195, and it is the first proof-of-concept for systemic targeted a particle immunotherapy in humans. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.",Excluded
2799,"Influence of increment of gantry angle and number of arcs on esophageal volumetric modulated arc therapy planning in Monaco planning system: A planning study The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of the increment of gantry angle and the number of arcs on esophageal volumetric modulated arc therapy plan. All plans were done in Monaco planning system for Elekta Synergy linear accelerator with 80 multileaf collimator (MLC). Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were done with different increment of gantry angle like 15 o , 20 o , 30 o and 40 o. The remaining parameters were similar for all the plans. The results were compared. To compare the plan quality with number of arcs, VMAT plans were done with single and dual arc with increment of gantry angle of 20 o. The dose to gross tumor volume (GTV) for 60 Gy and planning target volume (PTV) for 48 Gy was compared. The dosimetric parameters D 98% , D 95% , D 50% and D max of GTV were analyzed. The homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) of GTV were studied and the dose to 98% and 95% of PTV was analyzed.

2292,"Volume of high-dose regions and likelihood of locoregional control after perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy: do hotter implants work better? PURPOSE: To determine whether perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy (PHDRB) implants with larger high-dose regions produce increased locoregional control., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients (n=166) enrolled in several PHDRB prospective studies conducted at the University of Navarre were analyzed. The PHDRB was given to total doses of 16Gy/4 b.i.d. or 24Gy/6 b.i.d. treatments for negative or close/positive margins along with 45Gy/25 Rx of external beam radiation therapy. The histogram-based generalized equivalent uniform dose (EUD) formulism was used to quantify and standardize the dose-volume histogram into 2-Gy equivalents. The region of interest analyzed included: tissue volume encompassed by the prescription isodose of 4Gy (TV100). Routine dose reporting parameters such as physical dose and single-point 2-Gy equivalent dose were used for reference., RESULTS: After a median followup of 7.4 years (range, 3-12+), 50 patients have failed, and 116 remain controlled at last followup. Overall, EUD was not different in the patients who failed compared with controls (89.1Gy vs. 86.5Gy; p=not significant). When patients were stratified by risk using the University of Navarre Predictive Model, very high-risk patients (i.e., tumors >=3cm resected with close <1mm/positive margins) had an improved locoregional control with higher EUD values (p=0.028). This effect was not observed in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk University of Navarre Predictive Model categories., CONCLUSIONS: In very high-risk patients, enlarged high-dose regions can produce a dose-response effect. Routine dose reporting methods such as physical dose and single-point 2-Gy equivalent dose may not show this effect, but it can be revealed by histogram-based EUD assessment.

2949,"HOPE for Rational Statin Allocation for Primary Prevention: A Coronary Artery Calcium Picture Is Worth 1000 Words Allocation of statin therapy for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in borderline- and intermediate-risk patients has traditionally been based on population-based global risk assessment and other clinical and laboratory characteristics. Patient-specific treatment decisions are needed to provide maximal benefit and avoid unnecessary treatment. Guideline-based lipid management proposes that coronary artery calcium scoring is reasonable to implement in patients with a 10-year risk of 5.0% to 19.9% (borderline to intermediate risk) by using the pooled cohort equations when the decision about whether to initiate statin therapy is uncertain. We report data from both observational studies and a large primary prevention randomized controlled trial that support the position that this decision is, in fact, uncertain in about half of such patients because of risk misclassification. Such misclassification can be largely avoided by more widespread implementation of coronary calcium scoring, which helps to identify those with coronary artery calcium scores of 0, a finding associated with a less than 5.0% 10-year probability of an ASCVD event. Deferral of statin therapy in such patients, in the absence of smoking, diabetes, or a family history of premature ASCVD, provides more individualized and appropriate care and avoids the expense and potential adverse effects of statin therapy in those with low potential for absolute risk reduction. A rationale is also provided for the importance of coronary artery calcium scoring in women 50 years and older, possibly in place of 1 screening mammogram in women at least 55 years of age to avoid incremental radiation exposure, on the basis of the substantially higher lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality from ASCVD than from breast cancer. In patients with borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk, coronary artery calcium scoring should be used, whenever possible, as an aid to rational statin allocation for the primary prevention of ASCVD.

867,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

1668,"Abdominal aortic calcification on a plain X-ray and the relation with significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients Background: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is common in asymptomatic chronic dialysis patients and plays an important role in their poor survival. Early identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. Method(s): All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. Result(s): A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 67 +/- 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 +/- 4.9 vs 6.3 +/- 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. Conclusion(s): This study shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of CAD.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Excluded
3210,"Phase I drug and light dose-escalation trial of motexafin lutetium and far red light activation (phototherapy) in subjects with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and stent deployment: procedural and long-term results BACKGROUND: Motexafin lutetium (MLu; Antrin) is a photosensitizer that is taken up by atherosclerotic plaque and concentrated within macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells. After photoactivation with far red light, MLu facilitates production of cytotoxic oxygen radicals that mediate apoptosis. We assessed the safety and tolerability of phototherapy (PT) with MLu in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment., METHODS AND RESULTS: An open-label, phase I, drug and light dose-escalation clinical trial of MLu PT enrolled 80 patients undergoing de novo coronary stent deployment. MLu was administered to 79 patients by intravenous infusion 18 to 24 hours before procedure, and photoactivation was performed after balloon predilatation and before stent deployment. Clinical evaluation, serial quantitative angiography, and intravascular ultrasound were performed periprocedurally and at 6 months follow-up. MLu PT was well tolerated without serious dose-limiting toxicities, and side effects (paresthesia and rash) were minor. No adverse angiographic outcomes were attributed to phototherapy., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that coronary MLu PT seems safe, and the maximum well-tolerated MLu dose and range of tolerated light doses were identified. These data can be used in phase II efficacy trials of MLu PT for the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis or vulnerable plaque.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: The database of the Cancer Registry of Slovenia was used for the identification of patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: bone marrow biopsy showing less than 10% plasma cells, normal skeletal survey, and immunohistochemically determined tumor monoclonality. Simulation/portal films were reviewed to assess the extent of elective nodal XRT. Result(s): Twenty-six patients with 31 tumors fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In 4 patients, nine metachronously appearing solitary tumors were diagnosed. The head-and-neck region and other body sites were the sites of origin of primary tumors in 84% and 16% of patients, respectively, whereas in the two regions, regional disease was seen in 15% and 60% of patients, respectively. Therapy was as follows: XRT, 12 patients; surgery and postoperative XRT, 15 patients; and surgery, 4 patients. Ultimate local and regional control rates were 90% and 97%, respectively, and MM developed in 2 (8%) patients. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates were 87% and 61%, respectively. The analysis of the dose-effect relationship showed that more conservative treatment is justified: for macroscopic disease, 40-50 Gy (2 Gy/day), adjusted to the bulk of disease; for microscopic disease, 36-40 Gy; after R0 surgery, no XRT is required, but close observation is needed. No attempts should be made to treat uninvolved nodal regions. Using Bartl's histologic grading criteria, trends were detected in patients with higher tumor grades: regional lymph node involvement (p = 0.04) and shorter disease-specific survival (p = 0.08). Conclusion(s): Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a highly curable disease when XRT is used with or without previous surgery. The rate of conversion to MM is low. Moderate-dose XRT using limited fields is recommended. The prognostic value of Bartl's grading system needs further evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-330 expression in serum. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-330 for the radiation sensitivity of brain metastasis from LC. Related clinical factors for radiation sensitivity were assessed by logistic regression analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted using COX regression and the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: MiR-330 exhibited lower expression in the radiation-sensitive group than in the radiation-resistant group. The area under the ROC curve of miR-330 for predicting radiation sensitivity was 0.898 (optimal cut-off value, 0.815), with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 90.1%. After radiation therapy, patients with low miR-330 expression, compared to patients with high miR-330 expression, displayed a lower survival rate and a median survival time. MiR-330 expression was correlated with extracranial metastasis, maximum BM diameter, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and node (N) stage. Logistic regression and COX regression analyses revealed that extracranial metastasis, TNM stage, N stage and miR-330 expression were factors that influenced both radiation sensitivity and individual prognostic factors in patients with BM from LC., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the downregulation of miR-330 correlates with radiation sensitivity and poor prognosis in patients with BM from LC.

This study aimed to determine the age-, gender- and body mass index (BMI)-related changes in the femoral neck, especially on the neck-shaft angle, by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements. Method s Retrospective analyses of DXA images of the proximal femur from 18,943 individuals aged 20-108 years were performed. The age, gender, weight and height of each individual were obtained at the time of bone measurement. Data on theta angle were obtained from DXA measurements. Simple linear regression analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between theta and age, gender and BMI. Results There was a significant correlation between theta and age (p < 0.001). We also found a significant difference between the various age groups using analysis of variance (p < 0.001), but there was no meaningful correlation between theta and BMI (p = 0.377) and the BMI groups (p = 0.180). There were small but statistically significant differences in the neck-shaft angle between males and females (p < 0.05). Conclusion In this study, DXA-based measurements were used and many parameters of proximal femur geometry were calculated with limited radiation exposure. We have demonstrated that the mean neck-shaft angle is greater in males than in females, and that theta increases with age.

Methods A retrospective analysis of 41 patients who had received tumor-bed FSRS (5 fractions) or SRT (10 fractions) after resection of brain metastasis between 2005 and 2015 was performed. All resection cavities were treated with a frameless linear accelerator-based system. Patients who underwent subtotal resection, single-dose SRS to the resection cavity, or were treated with a fractionation schedule other than 5 or 10 fractions, were excluded. Results Twenty-six patients were treated with 5 fractions and 15 patients with 10 fractions. The median planning target volume was 19.78 cm3 (12.3-28 cm3) to the 5-fraction group and 29.79 cm3 (26.3-47.6 cm3) to the 10-fraction group (P = 0.020). The 1-year and 2-year local control rates for all patients were 89.4% and 77.1%, respectively, and 89.6% and 78.6% were free from distant intracranial progression, respectively. No difference was observed in local control or freedom from distant intracranial progression between the 5-fraction or 10-fraction groups. The median overall survival was 28.27 months (95% confidence interval, 19.42-37.12) for all patients. No patient developed necrosis at the resection cavity. Conclusions Fractionation offers the potential to exploit the different biological responses between neoplastic and normal tissues to ionizing radiation. The use of 5 daily doses of 5-6 Gy or 10 daily doses of 3 Gy is a good strategy to have a reasonable local control and avoid neurotoxicity.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

1809,"Baseline MAPK signaling activity confers intrinsic radioresistance to KRAS-mutant colorectal carcinoma cells by rapid upregulation of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) is overexpressed in malignant tumors and involved in DNA damage response upon ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we investigate its role in radioresistance of colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and evaluate a pharmacological approach to enhance CRC radiosensitivity via downregulation of hnRNP K. We show that hnRNP K is overexpressed in CRC tissue specimens and upregulated in response to IR in vitro, which occurs faster in KRAS-mutant CRC cells. HnRNP K knockdown impairs cell survival, cell cycle progression and KRAS-dependent radioresistance and increases apoptosis. Using the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, a decrease in xenograft tumor growth and radioresistance upon hnRNP K depletion could be verified in vivo, and comparable effects were achieved by suppression of hnRNP K expression using the MEK inhibitor MEK162 (Binimetinib). In summary, KRAS-mutant CRC shows intrinsic radioresistance along with rapid upregulation of hnRNP K in response to IR that can effectively be targeted by MEK inhibition.

Dynamic 64-detector-row CT and balanced steady-state free precession-based non-contrast-enhanced 3-T MR imaging were performed. RAV visualization based on a four-point score was documented. Both anatomical location and variation on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated, and the findings were compared with catheter venography as the gold standard., RESULTS: The RAV was visualized in 93.2% by CT and 84.8% by MR imaging (p = 0.02). Positive predictive values of RAV visualization were 100% for CT and 95.2% for MR imaging. Imaging score was significantly higher in CT than MR imaging (p < 0.01). The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 16% of patients. The RAV orifice level on cross-sectional imaging was concordant with catheter venography within the range of 1/3 vertebral height in >70% of subjects. Success rate of AVS was 99.2%., CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT is a reliable way to map the RAV prior to AVS. Non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging is an alternative when there is a risk of complication from contrast media or radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: Dynamic CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging detect the right adrenal vein (RAV). Dynamic CT can visualize the RAV more than non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Mapping the RAV helps to achieve successful adrenal venous sampling. Sixteen per cent of RAVs share the common trunk with accessory hepatic veins.",Excluded
2679,"Phase i study of preoperative chemoradiation with S-1 and oxaliplatin in patients with locally advanced resectable rectal cancer Purpose: To perform a Phase I study of preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with S-1, a novel oral fluoropyrimidine, plus oxaliplatin in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose. Methods and Materials: Radiotherapy was delivered to a total of 45 Gy in 25 fractions and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a fixed dose of oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2/week) on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and escalated doses of S-1 on Days 1-14 and 22-35. The initial dose of S-1 was 50 mg/m2/day, gradually increasing to 60, 70, and 80 mg/m2/day. Surgery was performed within 6 +/- 2 weeks. Result(s): Twelve patients were enrolled and tolerated up to Dose Level 4 (3 patients at each dose level) without dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 3 patients were enrolled at Dose Level 4, with 1 experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 diarrhea. Although maximum tolerated dose was not attained, Dose Level 4 (S-1 80 mg/m 2/day) was chosen as the recommended dose for further Phase II studies. No Grade 4 toxicity was observed, and Grade 3 toxicities of leukopenia and diarrhea occurred in the same patient (1 of 15, 6.7%). Pathologic complete responses were observed in 2 of 15 patients (13.3%). Conclusion(s): The recommended dose of S-1 was determined to be 80 mg/m2/day when combined with oxaliplatin in preoperative CRT, and a Phase II trial is now ongoing.

3117,"Masking responses to light in period mutant mice Masking is an acute effect of an external signal on an overt rhythm and is distinct from the process of entrainment. In the current study, we investigated the phase dependence and molecular mechanisms regulating masking effects of light pulses on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The circadian genes, Period1 (Per1) and Per2, are necessary components of the timekeeping machinery and entrainment by light appears to involve the induction of the expression of Per1 and Per2 mRNAs in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We assessed the roles of the Per genes in regulating masking by assessing the effects of light pulses on nocturnal locomotor activity in C57BL/6J Per mutant mice. We found that Per1-/- and Per2-/- mice had robust negative masking responses to light. In addition, the locomotor activity of Per1 -/-/Per2-/- mice appeared to be rhythmic in the light-dark (LD) cycle, and the phase of activity onset was advanced (but varied among individual mice) relative to lights off. This rhythm persisted for 1 to 2 days in constant darkness in some Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice. Furthermore, Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice exhibited robust negative masking responses to light. Negative masking was phase dependent in wild-type mice such that maximal suppression was induced by light pulses at zeitgeber time 14 (ZT14) and gradually weaker suppression occurred during light pulses at ZT16 and ZT18. By measuring the phase shifts induced by the masking protocol (light pulses were administered to mice maintained in the LD cycle), we found that the phase responsiveness of Per mutant mice was altered compared to wild-types. Together, our data suggest that negative masking responses to light are robust in Per mutant mice and that the Per1-/-/Per2-/- SCN may be a light-driven, weak/damping oscillator.

2214,"High-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and abdominal aorta: is simultaneous coronary artery assessment possible? OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the average heart rate and heart rate variability required for diagnostic imaging of the coronary arteries with high-pitch dual-source CT angiography of the thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred consecutively registered patients (82 men, 18 women; mean age, 68 +/- 13 years) underwent clinically indicated CT angiography of the thoracic (n = 33) and thoracoabdominal (n = 67) aorta with a dual-source 128-MDCT scanner in ECG-synchronized high-pitch (pitch, 3.2) data acquisition mode. No beta-blockers were administered. The image quality of the coronary arteries was graded on a 3-point scale by two independent blinded readers. The average heart rate and heart rate variability before data acquisition were noted. Effective radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: Interobserver agreement on grade of image quality for the 1,414 coronary segments evaluated by both observers was good (kappa = 0.68). Diagnostic image quality was found for 1,375 of the 1,414 segments (97.2%) in 83 of 100 patients (83%). In 17% of the patients, image quality was nondiagnostic for at least one coronary artery segment. Average heart rate and heart rate variability (each p < 0.05) were significantly higher in patients with at least one nondiagnostic coronary segment compared with those without. All patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min had diagnostic image quality in all coronary segments. Effective radiation doses were 2.3 +/- 0.3 mSv for thoracic and 4.4 +/- 0.5 mSv for thoracoabdominal CT angiography. The average scan times were 0.88 +/- 0.06 second for thoracic and 1.67 +/- 0.15 seconds for thoracoabdominal CT angiography., CONCLUSION: For patients with an average heart rate less than 63 beats/min and heart rate variability less than 1.2 beats/min, dual-source CT angiography of the thoracoabdominal aorta at a high pitch of 3.2 delivers diagnostic depiction of the coronary arteries at a low radiation dose.",Excluded
1073,"Enumeration of circulating microparticles in healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation Background: Strong evidence suggests microparticles (MP) as a biomarker of vascular injury. It may also contribute to the initiation and the development of atherosclerosis. In fact, several biological mechanisms might be responsible of atherosclerosis caused by radiation exposure even at a low dose. Therefore, the measurement of MP might be of a great potential for providing new insight into low-dose radiation cardiovascular risk. Aim(s): We investigated the effect of long-term medical occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) on MP populations levels. Method(s): The current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to LDIR and 29 matched controls by gender, age, and smoking habits. The measured MP by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS-), and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Result(s): Total MP (PS-/PS+), regardless of phenotype, were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to LDIR than controls (p=0.0004). In medical exposed workers, PS- MP predominated (68%) and were approximately three times more common than PS+ MP. Concerning the measurement of MP according to their cellular origin, we found that MP derived from platelets (CD41a+ PMP), endothelial (CD146+ EMP), leucocytes (CD45+ LMP) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ RMP) are more abundant in exposed workers than those in controls (p< 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the proportion of the other blood elements in the peripheral circulation between the two groups. In addition, no association was observed between MP levels and the studied confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that elevated circulating MP populations levels represent an indicator of cellular damage caused by medical exposure to LDIR. By consequence, the quantification of MP seems to a useful biomarker for assessing the negative effects of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (Figure Presented) .",Included
1032,"Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapeutic approach against lead nitrate- and/or gamma radiation-induced hepatotoxicity Because of the potential regenerative and cytoprotective effects of its content of numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) became an attractive biomaterial for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded
102,"Location of Disease on Imaging may Predict Radiation Exposure During Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed for various diseases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the difference of dose-area product (DAP) during the ERCP procedures according to location of the lesion. We performed a retrospective study of consecutive 217 therapeutic ERCP examinations performed between November 2014 and April 2015 at a tertiary care center. ERCP procedures divided into two groups according to location of the lesion identified on imaging: lesions in the common hepatic duct (CHD) or the common bile duct (CBD) and lesions in the hepatic hilum or the intrahepatic duct (IHD). The mean DAP of the hilum-IHD group (48.7 Gy cm2) was significantly higher than that of the CBD-CHD group (34.9 Gy cm2) (P = 0.003). Radiation exposure during ERCP was significantly different according to location of bile duct lesion. Copyright © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

1071,"Consequences of the radiation accident at the Mayak production association in 1957 (the 'Kyshtym Accident') This paper presents an overview of the nuclear accident that occurred at the Mayak Production Association (PA) in the Russian Federation on 29 September 1957, often referred to as 'Kyshtym Accident', when 20 MCi (740 PBq) of radionuclides were released by a chemical explosion in a radioactive waste storage tank. 2 MCi (74 PBq) spread beyond the Mayak PA site to form the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT). The paper describes the accident and gives brief characteristics of the efficacy of the implemented protective measures that made it possible to considerably reduce doses to the exposed population. The paper also provides retrospective dosimetry estimates for the members of the EURT Cohort (EURTC) which comprises approximately 21 400 people. During the first two years after the accident a decrease in the group average leukocyte (mainly due to neutrophils and lymphocytes) and thrombocyte count was observed in the population. At later dates an increased excess relative risk of solid cancer incidence and mortality was found in the EURTC.",Excluded
2586,"Magnetization transfer attenuation of creatine resonances in localized proton MRS of human brain in vivo To assess putative magnetization transfer effects on the proton resonances of cerebral metabolites in human brain, we performed quantitative proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2.0 T, STEAM, TR/TE/TM = 6000/40/10 ms, LCModel data evaluation) of white matter (7.68 mL, 10 healthy young subjects) in the absence and presence of fast repetitive off-resonance irradiation (2.1 kHz from the water resonance) using a train of 100 Gaussian-shaped RF pulses (12.8 ms duration, 120 Hz nominal bandwidth, 40 ms repetition period, 1080 degrees nominal flip angle). A comparison of pertinent metabolite concentrations revealed a magnetization transfer attenuation factor of the methyl and methylene resonances of creatine and phosphocreatine of 0.87 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.01). No attenuation was observed for the resonances of N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylaspartylglutamate, glutamate and glutamine, choline-containing compounds, and myo-inositol. The finding for total creatine is in excellent agreement with data reported for rat brain. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of a chemical exchange of mobile creatine or phosphocreatine molecules with a small immobilized or 'bound' pool.

Seventeen patients (average heart rate of <=65 beats per minute [bpm] prior to acquisition) were evaluated in the HPS mode, 88 (average heart rate of >65 and <=80 bpm prior to acquisition) in the SAS mode, and 33 (average heart rate of >80 bpm prior to acquisition or patients with an unstable heart rhythm) in the LPS mode. Radiation dose and image noise were recorded for each patient. Diagnostic acceptability was graded using a four-point scale (1, unacceptable; 2, suboptimal; 3, acceptable; 4, fully acceptable)., RESULTS: The effective dose in the HPS mode was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv, which was lower than that in SAS (8.9 +/- 2.7 mSv) and LPS (21.5 +/- 4.3 mSv) modes. There were no significant differences in the image noise levels in the descending aorta and left atrium. The average per-patient diagnostic acceptability was 3.2, 3.6, and 3.7 in HPS, SAS, and LPS modes, respectively., CONCLUSION: The radiation dose is lower with HPS than with other modes, and the HPS mode-acquired images of patients with heart rates of <=65 bpm are nearly acceptable for diagnostic image interpretation.

432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded
1428,"Submillisievert chest dual energy computed tomography: a pilot study OBJECTIVE: To assess if diagnostic dual energy CT (DECT) of the chest can be achieved at submillisievert (sub-mSv) doses., METHODS: Our IRB-approved prospective study included 20 patients who were scanned on dual-source multidector CT(MDCT). All patients gave written informed consent for acquisition of additional image series at reduced radiation dose on a dual-source MDCT (80/140 kV) within 10 s after the standard of care acquisition. Dose reduction was achieved by reducing the quality reference milliampere-second, with combined angular exposure control. Four readers, blinded to all clinical data, evaluated the image sets. Image noise, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio were assessed. Volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol), doselength product (DLP), size specific dose estimate, and effective dose were also recorded., RESULTS: The mean age and body mass index of the patients were 71 years +/- 9 and 24 kg m-2 +/- 3, respectively. Although images became noisier, overall image quality and image sharpness on blended images were considered good or excellent in all cases (20/20). All findings made on the reduced dose images presented with good demarcation. The intraobserver and interobserver agreements were kappa = 0.83 and 0.73, respectively. Mean CTDIvol, size specific dose estimate, DLP and effective dose for reduced dose DECT were: 1.3 +/- 0.2 mGy, 1.8 +/- 0.2 mGy, 51 +/- 9.9 mGy.cm and 0.7 +/- 0.1 mSv, respectively., CONCLUSION: Routine chest DECT can be performed at sub-mSv doses with good image quality and without loss of relevant diagnostic information. Advances in knowledge: (1) Contrast-enhanced DECT of the chest can be performed at sub-mSv doses, down to mean CTDIvol 1.3 mGy and DLP 51 mGy.cm in patients with body mass index <31 kg m-2.

1231,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

1336,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and risk of glioma BACKGROUND: About 9% of human cancers are brain tumors, of which 90% are gliomas. gamma-Radiation has been identified as a risk factor for brain tumors. In a previous pilot study, we found that lymphocytes from patients with glioma were more sensitive to gamma-radiation than were lymphocytes from matched control subjects. In this larger case-control study, we compared the gamma-radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes from glioma patients with those from control subjects and investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and the risk for developing glioma., METHODS: We used a mutagen sensitivity assay (an indirect measure of DNA repair activity) to assess chromosomal damage. We gamma-irradiated (1.5 Gy) short-term lymphocyte cultures from 219 case patients with glioma and from 238 healthy control subjects frequency matched by age and sex. After irradiation, cells were cultured for 4 hours, and then Colcemid was added for 1 hour to arrest cells in mitosis. Fifty metaphases were randomly selected for each sample and scored for chromatid breaks. All statistical tests were two-sided., RESULTS: We observed a statistically significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks per cell from case patients with glioma (mean = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.59) than from control subjects (mean = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.48) (P<.001). Using 0.40 (the median number of chromatid breaks per cell in control subjects) as the cut point for defining mutagen sensitivity and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, we found that mutagen sensitivity was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk for glioma (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.06). When the data were divided into tertiles, the relative risk for glioma increased from the lowest tertile to the highest tertile (trend test, P<.001)., CONCLUSION: gamma-Radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity of lymphocytes may be associated with an increased risk for glioma, a result that supports our earlier preliminary findings.",Included

Method(s): The authors retrospectively analyzed 26 consecutive adults (9 women and 17 men; median age 60.4 years; Karnofsky Performance Status [KPS] >=70) who underwent GKR for recurrent HGGs from 2004-2009. Median lesion volume was 1.22 cc, and median treatment dose was 15 Gy. Pathology included glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; n = 16), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA; n = 5), and anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMOA; n = 5). Two patients lost to follow-up were excluded from radiographic outcome analyses. Result(s): Median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort from the time of GKR was 13.5 months. Values for 12-month actuarial survival from time of GKR for GBM, AMOA, and AA were 37%, 20% and 80%. Local failure occurred in 9 patients (37.5%) at a median time of 5.8 months, and 18 patients (75%) experienced distant progression at a median of 4.8 months. Complications included radiation necrosis in two patients and transient worsening of hemiparesis in one patient. Multivariate hazard ratio (HR) analysis showed KPS 90 or greater, smaller tumor volumes, and increased time to recurrence after resection to be associated with longer OS following GKR. Conclusion(s): GKR provided good local tumor control in this group of clinically stable and predominantly high-functioning patients with small recurrent HGGs after radical resection. Meaningful survival times after GKR were seen. GKR can be considered for selected patients with recurrent HGGs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and who would normally be investigated with AR were randomized to either AR or LDCT. The estimated radiation dose of the LDCT protocol was 2-3mSv compared to 1.1mSv for AR. Pearson's chi-square and the independent samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 142 patients were eligible, and after exclusions and omitting those with incomplete data, 55 patients remained for analysis in the AR arm and 53 in the LDCT arm. A diagnosis could be obtained in 12 (21.8%) patients investigated with AR compared to 34 (64.2%) for LDCT (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight (50.9%) patients in the AR group required further imaging during their admission compared to 14 (26.4%) in the LDCT group (P= 0.009). There was no difference in the median hospital LOS (3.84 days for AR versus 4.24 days for LDCT, P= 0.83). Conclusion(s): LDCT demonstrates a superior diagnostic yield over AR and reduces the number of subsequent imaging tests for a minimal cost in radiation exposure. However, there is no difference in the overall hospital LOS between the two imaging strategies. © 2011 The Authors. ANZ Journal of Surgery © 2011 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Excluded
450,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the potential benefits of delayed phase imaging series in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Routine contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans of 1000 consecutively examined patients (912 men, 88 women; average age, 60 years; range, 22-94 years) were retrospectively evaluated, and the added benefits of the delayed phase series through the abdomen were recorded for each examination. Examinations performed for indications requiring multiphasic imaging were excluded. Images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists, who were blinded to official CT reports. All examinations were performed between July 2008 and February 2010 at a single institution. Radiation doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure. RESULTS. Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no benefit. In addition, use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective CONCLUSION. An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrastenhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
810,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible.

All bronchial stumps were buttressed with an intercostal muscle., RESULTS: There were 104 patients, 50 in the LD group and 54 patients in the HD group. Median dose of radiation was 45 Gy (range 35-50.4) in the LD group and 60 Gy (range 60-66.7) in the HD group. Complete pathologic response rate was 10% compared to 28% favoring the HD group (p = 0.04). Median length of stay for both groups was 4 days and the ICU was avoided in 74%. Major morbidity and mortality rates were similar: 8% compared to 9% and 2% compared to 3.7% for the low and high dose groups, respectively. Pneumonectomy was a significant risk factor for morbidity (OR = 17.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection after preoperative chest radiation is safe even after 60 Gy or higher. Sixty or higher may afford an increase in complete pathologic response and it does not seem to increase morbidity or mortality. However, if pneumonectomy is known to be required we prefer to avoid neoadjuvant radiotherapy and use chemotherapy alone.",Excluded
2163,"Lower body negative pressure counters posture induced increases of intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure Purpose: Recent ophthalmic evaluations of seven astronauts after six-month missions to International Space Station show unexpected vision impairment. In addition, lumbar punctures in four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. This Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is likely related to a headward body fluid shift that elevates intracranial pressure (ICP). We hypothesized that a moderate level of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) would counteract head down, body-tilt, induced elevations in IOP and ICP. Method(s): Twenty-five normal healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in this study (mean age: 31 years). Right and left IOP, ICP (non-invasive ultrasound pulsed phase locked loop), arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute of each testing condition. Subjects were positioned supine (5 mins), sitting (5 mins), 15-degrees head-down tilt (HDT) (5 mins) and ten minutes of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests were balanced. The right and left IOP values were averaged and used for statistical analysis (significance accepted at p<0.05). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. The change from supine was calculated for IOP values. Result(s): IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during head-down-tilt significantly lowered IOP to supine levels (difference from supine, 0.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg). In addition, added LBNP during HDT significantly decreased ICP-related pulse amplitudes of transcranial ultrasound waveforms by 2.1+/-3.4 microns (n=9). Mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly across all conditions. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that short duration exposures to HDT increase IOP and ICP significantly and further, that LBNP counteracts these elevations of IOP and ICP. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that shift fluid to lower body may mitigate vision problems.",Excluded
1890,"Plasminogen is a master regulator and a potential drug candidate for the healing of radiation wounds Around 95% of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy experience cutaneous side effects, and some develop radiation wounds or fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for these indications. We show here that plasminogen administration enhanced the healing of radiation wounds via pleiotropic effects on gene expression. Using RNA sequencing, we found that plasminogen downregulated the expression of genes in the TLR, TNF, WNT, MAPK, and TGF-beta signaling pathways, and enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of arachidonic acid, leading to significantly decreased inflammation and improved remodeling of granulation tissue compared with placebo treatment. In addition, plasminogen induced metabolic changes, including decreased glycolysis. Importantly, many of the factors downregulated by plasminogen are pro-fibrotic. Therefore, in radiation wounds with excessive inflammation, plasminogen is able to enhance and redirect the healing process, such that it more closely resembles physiological healing with significantly reduced risk for developing fibrosis. This makes plasminogen an attractive drug candidate for the treatment of radiation wounds in cancer patients.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
678,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded
945,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included
1233,"Pharyngocutaneous fistula after salvage laryngectomy: IMPACT of interval between radiotherapy and surgery, and performance of bilateral neck dissection Background Pharyngocutaneous fistula is a serious complication of total laryngectomy. The purpose of this study was to examine predisposing factors at our institution. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 94 consecutive patients undergoing total laryngectomy. Cases with hypopharyngeal primary tumors or undergoing extended hypopharyngeal resection with flap augmentation of the pharynx were excluded. Results Seventy-four cases met inclusion criteria. A total of 25.7% patients developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The fistula rate was higher after salvage laryngectomy than after primary surgery (34.0% vs 11.1%; p =.05). Among salvage laryngectomies, performance of laryngectomy within 1 year of completion of radiotherapy (p =.006) and performance of concomitant bilateral neck dissection (p =.02) were significant risk factors for development of a fistula. Radiation dose, addition of chemotherapy, use of pectoralis major myofascial flap, preoperative tracheostomy, primary puncture, primary tumor subsite, and initial T classification were not significant. Conclusion Interval between completion of radiotherapy and surgery is significantly associated with pharyngocutaneous fistula after salvage total laryngectomy. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
231,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
2058,"Multicenter Phase 2 Study of Peri-Irradiation Chemotherapy Plus Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy With Concurrent Weekly Docetaxel for Inoperable or Medically Unresectable Nonmetastatic Gastric Cancer Purpose To assess the efficacy and feasibility of concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) plus preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy for patients with nonmetastatic gastric carcinoma who do not undergo surgery. Methods and Materials Patients with inoperable (due to medical comorbid conditions or patient's refusal to undergo surgery) or unresectable gastric cancer received up to 2 21-day cycles of preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy (docetaxel 37.5 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8, cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, and a continuous infusion of fluorouracil [FU] 750 mg/m2 on days 1-5), respectively. CCRT between preradiation and postradiation chemotherapy was initiated on day 43 and consisted of intensity modulated radiation therapy (50.4 Gy) plus concurrent docetaxel 20 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks. Results 36 patients were evaluable; 21 patients with comorbid conditions were unsuitable for surgery (group 1), 8 had unresectable disease (group 2), and 7 refused surgery (group 3). The clinical complete response (cCR) rate for the 36 evaluable patients was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-53%) and the overall response rate was 83% (95% CI, 75%-97%). The median survival time and estimated 2-year survival rate were 25.8 months (95% CI, 7.1-44.5 months) and 52% (95% CI, 38%-67%), respectively. The estimated median OS and 2-year OS rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 37.0 months (95% CI, 7.9-66.1 months) and 52% (95% CI, 31%-73%), 17.7 months (95% CI, 7.8-27.6 months) and 20% (95% CI, 0%-49%), and 38.9 months (95% CI, 16.6-58.3 months) and 67% (95% CI, 30%-100%), respectively. Achieving a cCR was associated with significantly better overall survival (P=.004) and progression-free survival (P=.003). The most common grade 3 or greater toxicity during the chemotherapy phase was neutropenia. Common grade 3/4 toxicities during CCRT were nausea and vomiting.

1239,"A prospective clinical trial of proton therapy for chordoma and chondrosarcoma: Feasibility assessment Background/Objectives: Proton therapy (PRT) has emerged as a treatment option for chordomas/chondrosarcomas to escalate radiation dose more safely. We report results of a phase I/II trial of PRT in patients with chordoma/chondrosarcoma. Method(s): Twenty adult patients with pathologically confirmed, nonmetastatic chordoma or chondrosarcoma were enrolled in a single-institution prospective trial of PRT from 2010 to 2014. Seventeen patients received adjuvant PRT and three received definitive PRT. Median dose was 73.8 Gy(RBE; range 68.4-79.2 Gy) using PRT-only (n = 6) or combination PRT/intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) (n = 14). Quality-of-life (QOL) and fatigue were assessed weekly and every 3 months posttreatment with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACTBr) and Brief Fatigue Inventory. Primary endpoint was feasibility (90% completing treatment with < 10 day treatment delay and <= 20% unexpected acute grade >= 3 toxicity). Result(s): Tumors included chordomas of the skull base (n = 10), sacrum (n = 5), and cervical spine (n = 3), and skull base chondrosarcomas (n = 2). Median age was 57. The 80% had positive margins/gross disease. Median follow-up was 37 months. Feasibility endpoints were met. The 3-year local control and progression-free survival was 86% and 81%. There were no deaths. Two patients had acute grade 3 toxicity (both fatigue). One had late grade 3 toxicity (epistaxis and osteoradionecrosis). There were no significant differences in patient reported fatigue or QOL from baseline to the end-of-treatment.

Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included
1596,"Prospective evaluation of early treatment outcome in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy based on target volume definition with MRI and 68Ga-DOTATOC-PET Purpose. To evaluate early treatment results and toxicity in patients with meningiomas treated with particle therapy. Material and methods. Seventy patients with meningiomas were treated with protons (n = 38) or carbon ion radiotherapy (n = 26). Median age was 49 years. Median age at treatment was 55 years, 24 were male (34%), and 46 were female (66%). Histology was benign meningioma in 26 patients (37%), atypical in 23 patients (33%) and anaplastic in four patients (6%). In 17 patients (24%) with skull base meningiomas diagnosis was based on the typical appearance of a meningioma. For benign meningiomas, total doses of 52.2-57.6 GyE were applied with protons. For high-grade lesions, the boost volume was 18 GyE carbon ions, with a median dose of 50 GyE applied as highly conformal radiation therapy. Nineteen patients were treated as re-irradiation. Treatment planning with MRI and 68-Ga-DOTATOC-PET was evaluated. Results. Very low rates of side effects developed, including headaches, nausea and dizziness. No severe treatment-related toxicity was observed. Local control for benign meningiomas was 100%. Five of 27 patients (19%) developed tumor recurrence during follow-up. Of these, four patients had been treated as re-irradiation for recurrent high-risk meningiomas. Actuarial local control after re-irradiation of high-risk meningiomas was therefore 67% at six and 12 months. In patients treated with primary radiotherapy, only one of 13 patients (8%) developed tumor recurrence 17 months after radiation therapy (photon and carbon ion boost). Conclusion. Continuous prospective follow-up and development of novel study concepts are required to fully exploit the long-term clinical data after particle therapy for meningiomas. To date, it may be concluded that when proton therapy is available, meningioma patients can be offered a treatment at least comparable to high-end photon therapy.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

In addition, five males and five females were treated in a similar fashion, but were exposed to sham conditions. For each subject, a blood sample was obtained prior to the exposure period and aliquots were used as negative- (pre-exposure) and positive- [1.5 Gray (Gy) (60)Cobalt ((60)Co) gamma-irradiation] controls. At the end of the 4 h exposure period, a second blood sample was obtained. The extent of DNA damage was assessed in peripheral human blood leukocytes from all samples using the alkaline comet assay.

1107,"Induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemo-radiation in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma - A single institution experience Background: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is the commonest Head & Neck cancer in Saudi Arabia. Concomitant Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin followed by 3 cycles of adjuvant Cisplatin based chemotherapy is the standard of care in patients with locally advanced disease (LANPC). However, the compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy has been unsatisfactory. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2002 and July 2010, fifty-four patients (37 males: 17 females) with locally advanced (AJCC Stage III & IV), non-metastatic NPC were treated using Induction Chemotherapy (IC) with Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) for 3 cycles, followed by Concomitant chemo-radiation using weekly Carboplatin with conventionally fractionated 3-D conformal radiotherapy to a total dose of 65-70 Gy. Result(s): Median age was 42 year (15 to 72). Twenty-six patients (48%) had stage IV disease, and 17 (31%) had T4 tumours. Undifferentiated Carcinoma Nasopharyngeal Type accounted for 96% of the cases. Fortysix patients had more than 12 months follow-up (median 42) and are the subject of the following analysis. Two patients died during induction chemotherapy. Of the remaining 44 patients, IC resulted in 25% Complete Clinical Remission, and 72% Partial Remission, an overall Response Rate of 97%. Hematological toxicity was frequent, but manageable. In total, there were 2 local and 2 distant relapses, 2 of them appearing beyond 3-years of follow-up. Two patients died of progressive disease, one is alive with disease, and one local relapse was successfully salvaged with further radiotherapy. For the entire series (46 patients) the 4-year Kaplan-Meier Overall Survival (OS) rate is 88%. For the 44 patients who completed the protocol, the 4-year Disease Free Survival (DFS) rate is 84%. All 8 patients under 23 year of age remain disease-free at more than 6 years median follow-up. One patient developed a suspected grade 3 neurologic toxicity, and another had a cerebral-vascular accident one year following salvage local re-irradiation. Conclusion(s): Sequential therapy as used in this group of patients seems well tolerated and yields high remission rate and an encouraging DFS and OS in patients with LANPC. Future development should focus on better risk stratification, and systematic use of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapylike techniques. Young adults with LANPC may need a different treatment approach that would include IC followed by response-adjusted chemoradiotherapy.",Excluded
1128,"Nitric oxide treatment attenuates muscle atrophy during hind limb suspension in mice Debilitating muscle-disuse atrophy in aging or obesity has huge socioeconomic impact. Since nitric oxide (NO) mediates muscle satellite cell activation and induces hypertrophy with exercise in old mice, we tested whether treatment with the NO donor, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), during hind limb suspension would reduce atrophy. Mice were suspended 18 days, with or without daily ISDN (66 mg/kg). Muscles were examined for atrophy (weight, fiber diameter); regulatory changes in atrogin-1 (a negative regulator of muscle mass), myostatin (inhibits myogenesis), and satellite cell proliferation; and metabolic responses in myosin heavy chains (MyHCs), liver lipid, and hypothalamic gene expression. Suspension decreased muscle weight and weight relative to body weight between 25-55%, and gastrocnemius fiber diameter vs. controls. In young-adult mice, ISDN attenuated atrophy by half or more. In quadriceps, ISDN completely prevented the suspension-induced rise in atrogin-1 and drop in myostatin precursor, and attenuated the changes in MyHCs 1 and 2b observed in unloaded muscles without treatment. Fatty liver in suspended young-adult mice was also reduced by ISDN; suspended young mice had higher hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic agouti-related protein, Agrp than controls. Notably, a suspension-induced drop in muscle satellite cell proliferation by 25-58% was completely prevented (young mice) or attenuated (halved, in young-adult mice) by ISDN. NO-donor treatment has potential to attenuate atrophy and metabolic changes, and prevent regulatory changes during disuse and offset/prevent wasting in age-related sarcopenia or space travel. Increases in precursor proliferation resulting from NO treatment would also amplify benefits of physical therapy and exercise.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1164,"Clinical and Spectrophotometric Evaluation of Skin Photoadaptation in Vitiligo Patients after a Short Cycle of NB-UVB Phototherapy BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of photoadaptation to narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) radiation has been previously described in vitiligo and has usually been clinically measured by the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) after phototesting., OBJECTIVES: To assess the photoadaptive response in vitiligo and healthy skin after NB-UVB phototherapy not only clinically, but also by spectrophotometry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients affected by generalized vitiligo underwent NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly for 12 weeks. Before and after phototherapy, a phototesting procedure was administered on vitiligo patches and adjacent healthy skin with a solar simulated radiation (SSR). Visual assessment of the MED took place after 24 h. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the a* value and the melanin index (MI*), as signs of skin erythema and pigmentation. The photoadaptation factor (MED-PF) and the a* photoadaptation factor (a*-PF) were calculated., RESULTS: After NB-UVB phototherapy, both vitiligo and healthy skin showed an increase in MED and MI* values and a reduction of skin erythema compared to baseline (p < 0.05). MED-PF data showed a photoadaptation in 10 (71.4%) vitiligo lesions and in 12 (85.7%) healthy skin areas. The assessment of the a*-PF showed a negative mean percentage value in all affected and unaffected skin areas., CONCLUSIONS: A short cycle of NB-UVB phototherapy can induce photoadaptation in vitiligo by increasing the MED and reducing skin erythema after stimulation with SSR. This is most likely due to the physical filter function induced by ultraviolet radiation. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded

Design(s): A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. Lens doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. Result(s): Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less. Conclusion(s): The results emphasize the importance of ophthalmologic examination of retinoblastoma survivors who have undergone radiotherapy. The risk of cataract extraction in untreated eyes with retinoblastoma is comparable with the risk of the general population. ©2009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",Included
195,"A system for in vivo measurement of bone calcium by local neutron activation of the hand A 252Cf neutron-irradiation facility designed specifically for clinical in vivo measurement of calcium in the hand is described. Results of preliminary measurements are presented. Hand phantoms were exposed to the neutron beam for 10 min and the induced 49Ca activities were counted for 10 min after an elapsed time of 2 min.

Method(s): Clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of MCC and with an indication to undergo RT at the European Institute of Oncology between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field. At the time of data collection, 16 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 patient was alive with advanced status of disease, 8 patients died of disease progression, and 1 patient died of other causes.

Methods and Materials: Twenty-five patients with T3/T4N0 or N+ rectal cancer were enrolled. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on days -14, 0, and +14, and 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2/d from day -14 to the end of radiation therapy (day 0 is the start of radiation therapy). Radiation therapy consisted of 41.4 Gy in 18 fractions (2.3 Gy per fraction) with Tomotherapy to the tumor and regional lymph nodes (planning target volume, PTV) defined on simulation CT and MRI. After 9 fractions simulation CT and MRI were repeated for the planning of the adaptive phase: PTVadapt was generated by adding a 5-mm margin to the residual tumor. In the last 6 fractions a boost of 3.0 Gy per fraction (in total 45.6 Gy in 18 fractions) was delivered to PTVadapt while concomitantly delivering 2.3 Gy per fraction to PTV outside PTVadapt. Result(s): Three patients experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity; 2 of 3 showed toxicity before the adaptive phase. Full dose of radiation therapy, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil was delivered in 96%, 96%, and 88% of patients, respectively. Two patients with clinical complete response (cCR) refused surgery and were still cCR at 17 and 29 months. For the remaining 23 resected patients, 15 of 23 (65%) showed tumor regression grade 3 response, and 7 of 23 (30%) had pathologic complete response; 8 (35%) and 12 (52%) tumor regression grade 3 patients had <=5% and 10% residual viable cells, respectively. Conclusion(s): An adaptive boost strategy is feasible, with an acceptable grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity rate and a very encouraging tumor response rate. The results suggest that there should still be room for further dose escalation of the residual tumor with the aim of increasing pathologic complete response and/or cCR rates. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
891,"Mesenchymal stromal cells implantation in combination with platelet lysate product is safe for reconstruction of human long bone nonunion Objective: Nonunion is defned as a minimum of 9 months since injury without any visible progressive signs of healing for 3 months. Recent literature has shown that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells is safe, in vitro and in vivo, for treating long bone nonunion. The present study was performed to investigate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) implantation in combination with platelet lysate (PL) product for treating human long bone nonunion. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case series clinical trial, orthopedic surgeons visited eighteen patients with long bone nonunion, of whom 7 complied with the eligibility criteria. These patients received mesenchymal stromal cells (20 million cells implanted once into the nonunion site using a?uoroscopic guide) in combination with PL product. For evaluation of the effects of this intervention all the patients were followed up by taking anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of the affected limb before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the implantation. All side effects (local or systemic, serious or non-serious, related or unrelated) were observed during this time period. Result(s): From a safety perspective the MSC implantation in combination with PL was very well tolerated during the 12 months of the trial. Four patients were healed; based on the control X-ray evidence, bony union had occurred. Conclusion(s): Results from the present study suggest that the implantation of bone marrow-derived MSCs in combination with PL is safe for the treatment of nonunion. A double blind, controlled clinical trial is required to assess the effcacy of this treatment (Registration Number: NCT01206179).",Excluded
1956,"The role of CT and MRI fusion reconstruction-guided 3D printing navigation template for puncture during sacral neuromodulation: a clinical randomized controlled trial Objective: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the accurate puncture during sacral neuromodulation (SNM) guided with 3D printing navigation template based on reconstruction techniques using fusing sacral CT and MRI images. Method(s): Totally 42 patients operated with SNM were selected in Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University from July 2016 to August 2017. The patients were randomly divided into control group (n=22) and experimental group (n=20) using random number table. The conventional cross-positioning technique under X-ray was used for puncture during SNM in the control group. While in the experimental group, the sacral CT and MRI images were fused for reconstruction and design of the navigation template, printed by 3D technique for the puncture in SNM. The times of punctures, the average time for puncture operation, the time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator device, the minimum onset voltage of the stimulator, the X-ray radiation dose, postoperative curative effect (rate of secondary transformation) and the incidence rate of complications were compared between the two methods using independent-simple t test or chi2 test. Result(s): Compared to control group, fewer times of punctures, shorter time needed for puncture operation, shorter time of intraoperative testing of the stimulator, smaller radiation dose and minimum effective voltage were found in the experimental group (P<0.05). There were 15 and 16 patients who completed the secondary transformation in the control group and experimental group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (chi2=0.757, P=0.384). There were 3 cases of complications in the control group, including 2 cases of infection and 1 case of bleeding, while no complications in the experimental group. Conclusion(s): CT and MRI images fusion reconstruction-guided 3D printing navigation template can help perform accurate and safe punctures in SNM. Compared to conventional puncture positioned under X-ray, it can effectively improve the puncture efficiency, and reduce the radiation dose in the operation.Copyright © 2021 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded
1953,"10-Year Follow-Up After Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography in Patients With Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the long-term prognostic power of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to predict cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Background(s): Prognostic usefulness of coronary CTA has been confirmed for short- and intermediate-term follow-up. However, long-term data for prognostic usefulness is still lacking, but is paramount because of the slowly progressing nature of coronary artery disease (CAD). Method(s): A total of 2,011 patients with suspected but not previously diagnosed CAD were examined by coronary CTA. Mean follow-up was 10.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 8.1 to 11.2 years). Cox proportional hazards analysis was used for the composite endpoint of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Event-free survival, which was defined as the years it took to reach a cumulative 1% risk for the composite endpoint and reclassification from clinical risk, was calculated. Result(s): The study endpoint was reached in 58 patients (42 cardiac deaths, 16 nonfatal myocardial infarctions). Coronary CTA-assessed CAD severity (normal, nonobstructive, or obstructive) showed the best correlation with the endpoint, with an adjusted c-index of 0.704, compared with a univariate c-index of 0.622 for the clinical risk model (Morise score) alone. The annual event rate for patients with normal coronary arteries on baseline coronary CTA was 0.04%, which translated to an event-free survival period of 10 years. The highest annual event rate of 1.33% was found in patients with 3-vessel obstructive CAD. Reclassification from clinical risk (Morise score) was possible in approximately two-thirds of all patients (68%; p < 0.0001), which led to a substantial reduction of the intermediate-risk group (reduction from 74% to 15%) in favor of the low-risk group (increase from 20% to 83%). Conclusion(s): Patients with normal coronary CTA results benefitted from an event-free survival period of 10 years against cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Risk stratification according to coronary CTA results allowed for the delineation of clearly diverging prognostic groups and reclassified approximately two-thirds of all patients from clinical risk groups.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation",Excluded
333,"Integration of functional MRI and white matter tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
558,"The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment and the space endurance record-breaking mice The Italian Space Agency, in line with its scientific strategies and the National Utilization Plan for the International Space Station (ISS), contracted Thales Alenia Space Italia to design and build a spaceflight payload for rodent research on ISS: the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space. Unfortunately, during the MDS mission, one PTN-Tg and two Wt mice died due to health status or payload-related reasons. The remaining mice showed a normal behavior throughout the experiment and appeared in excellent health conditions at landing. During the experiment, the mice health conditions and their water and food consumption were daily checked. Upon landing mice were sacrificed, blood parameters measured and tissues dissected for subsequent analysis. To obtain as much information as possible on microgravity-induced tissue modifications, we organized a Tissue Sharing Program: 20 research groups from 6 countries participated. In order to distinguish between possible effects of the MDS housing conditions and effects due to the near-zero gravity environment, a ground replica of the flight experiment was performed at the University of Genova. Control tissues were collected also from mice maintained on Earth in standard vivarium cages.",Excluded
1857,"Increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of patients with long-standing Lhermitte's sign PURPOSE: To investigate the pathophysiology of the radiation-induced, chronic Lhermitte's sign (LS) on the basis of long-standing case histories with partial functional recovery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: As radiotherapy in two nasopharyngeal cancer patients, a biologically effective dose (BED) of 103.8 Gy(2) (case 1) and 94.8 Gy(2) (case 2) was delivered to the cervical spinal cord. Neurologic signs relating to the irradiated spinal cord segments developed after 2 months (case 1) and 5 years (case 2), with radiation-induced damage equivalent to grade 3 (case 1) and grade 2 (case 2) toxicity (Common Toxicity Criteria, Version 2.0). The clinical status improved to grade 2 (case 1) and grade 1 (case 2). Positron emission tomography (PET) and fibroblast clonogen assay were applied 25 and 7 years postirradiation, respectively, to characterize this rare clinical picture., RESULTS: PET demonstrated increased [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation and [(15)O]butanol perfusion, but negligible [(11)C]methionine uptake in the irradiated spinal cord segments in both patients. In clonogenic assays, fibroblasts from case 1 displayed much higher radiation sensitivity than in healthy controls, while in case 2 the fibroblasts sensitivity was normal., CONCLUSIONS: These data suggests a close direct relationship between regional perfusion and metabolism of the spinal cord, similarly as in the brain. The postirradiation recovery may be related to energy-demanding conduction, explaining the increased metabolism and perfusion. The increased radiosensitivity and higher spinal cord BED may have contributed to the more severe sequelae in case 1.",Excluded
327,"Radiation risks to lymphoma patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies Background: To investigate radiation risks to patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies that take into account patient age, sex, and weight. Method(s): We obtained patient demographics and weights of 54 consecutive patients with lymphoma who each underwent a18F-FDG PET study. The administered activity was converted into an effective dose using the patient size dependent dosimetry data provided in ICRP Publication 80. Patient effective doses were converted into estimates of the lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence and cancer mortality using age and sex dependent risk factors provided in BEIR VII. Result(s): The average patient age/weight in this study was 43 years/68 kg for males and 33 years/61 kg for females. Patient effective dose are proportional to patient weight(-0.784) (r2 >0.99). The average administered activity was 410 MBq, which resulted in an average effective dose of 8.5 mSv for males and 8.9 mSv for females. The average cancer incidence was 0.71/1,000 cases for males, and 1.27/1,000 cases for females, with cancer mortality being about half the incidence. Cancer rates for the youngest patients were an order of magnitude higher than those for the oldest patients. Conclusion(s): Average lifetime attributable cancer risks to lymphoma patients from a single FDG-PET study is approximately 1 per 1,000, but are strongly influenced by patient age, gender and weight. Cancer risk in younger patients is a magnitude of order greater.",Excluded
2070,"A cross-sectional case control study on genetic damage in individuals residing in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station Mobile phone base stations facilitate good communication, but the continuously emitting radiations from these stations have raised health concerns. Hence in this study, genetic damage using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay was assessed in peripheral blood leukocytes of individuals residing in the vicinity of a mobile phone base station and comparing it to that in healthy controls. The power density in the area within 300 m from the base station exceeded the permissive limits and was significantly (p = 0.000) higher compared to the area from where control samples were collected. The study participants comprised 63 persons with residences near a mobile phone tower, and 28 healthy controls matched for gender, age, alcohol drinking and occupational sub-groups. Genetic damage parameters of DNA migration length, damage frequency (DF) and damage index were significantly (p = 0.000) elevated in the sample group compared to respective values in healthy controls. The female residents (n = 25) of the sample group had significantly (p = 0.004) elevated DF than the male residents (n = 38). The linear regression analysis further revealed daily mobile phone usage, location of residence and power density as significant predictors of genetic damage.

777,"Predictors of Late Cardiovascular Complications in Survivors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Long-term survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is now an expected outcome. The growing population of survivors is at risk of developing treatment-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). A nested case-controlled design was used to identify clinical and treatment-related risk factors for development of late (1+ years after HCT) CVD. Cases were identified from a cohort of 1+-year survivors who underwent transplantation at City of Hope between 1977 and 2006. Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded
888,"Radiotherapy of the neuroaxis for palliative treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis Background: Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurs in about 5% of solid tumors and may seriously compromise quality of life. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of craniospinal irradiation with and without intrathecal chemotherapy and its efficacy with regard to symptom palliation and survival Patients and Methods: 16 patients (mean age 46 years; nine breast cancers, five lung cancers, one renal cell cancer, one tumor of unknown primary site) with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurring after a median interval from primary tumor diagnosis of 5 months (0-300 months) received craniospinal irradiation between October 1995 and May 2000. The median total dose was 36 Gy (a 1.6-2.0 Gy). Ten patients were additionally treated with intrathecal methotrexate (15 mg per cycle, 2-8 cycles). Result(s): Median survival was 12 weeks, 8 weeks after radiotherapy alone, 16 weeks after combined modality treatment. 14 patients died from disease. Eleven patients (68%) experienced regression of their neurological symptoms during or soon after completion of radiotherapy. Seven patients regained their ability to walk, six had pain reduction, three regression of bladder and bowel incontinence. In three patients symptom progression and in two patients no change occurred. Side effects were: myelo-suppression (CTC) Grade I: n = 2, Grade II: n = 4, Grade III: n = 4 patients and Grade IV: n = 1. Nine patients had dysphagia, seven mucositis, three suffered from nausea. No late toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): Craniospinal radiotherapy is feasible and effective for palliative treatment of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

2559,"3D deep learning angiography (3D-DLA) from C-arm Conebeam CT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULT(S): Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSION(S): Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology.

1860,"Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins in patients with atrial fibrillation: Reduction of fluoroscopy exposure and procedure duration by the use of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (NavX) Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of performing segmental pulmonary vein (PV) isolation guided by the NavX (Endocardial Solutions, St Jude Medical, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) system without the three-dimensional (3D) geometric reconstruction option and whether the use of NavX system will reduce the radiation exposure and procedure duration. Methods and Results: The study included 64 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation, in whom PV isolation was performed using fluoroscopic guidance (n=32) or the NavX system (n=32). Pulmonary vein mapping with a circular mapping catheter allowed the identification and localization of myocardial connections between the PV and the left atrium. PV isolation was performed by radiofrequency ablation of these connections at the atrial aspect of the PV ostium. Primary success rate for isolated PVs did not differ significantly in patients ablated under fluoroscopic guidance vs. those ablated under guidance of NavX system [100/107 PVs (93.5%) vs. 120/124 PV (96.8%; P=n.s.)]. Compared with fluoroscopy guided procedures, NavX-guided procedures showed a significant reduction in the fluoroscopy time (75.8+/-24.5 vs. 38.9+/-19.3 min, P<0.05), total X-ray exposure (93.2+/-51.6 vs. 56.6+/-37.9 Gy cm2, P=0.03), and total procedural time (237.7+/-65.4 vs. 188.6+/-62.7, P=0.01). The mean follow-up was 9.5+/-3.0 months. One patient in each group was lost to follow-up. Seven-day Holter monitoring showed that 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) in the NavX-guided group and 21 of 31 patients (67.7%) in the fluoroscopy-guided group were in sinus rhythm (P=0.57). Conclusion(s): The 3D visualization of the catheters by NavX system allows a rapid and precise visualization of the mapping and ablation catheters at the PV ostia and markedly reduces fluoroscopy time, total X-ray exposure, and procedural duration during PV isolation compared with ablation performed under fluoroscopy guidance. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded
1533,"Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound as a Radiation-Free Alternative to Fluoroscopic Nephrostogram for Evaluating Ureteral Patency PURPOSE: We compared contrast enhanced ultrasound and fluoroscopic nephrostography in the evaluation of ureteral patency following percutaneous nephrolithotomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort, noninferiority study was performed after obtaining institutional review board approval. We enrolled eligible patients with kidney and proximal ureteral stones who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy at our center. On postoperative day 1 patients received contrast enhanced ultrasound and fluoroscopic nephrostogram within 2 hours of each other to evaluate ureteral patency, which was the primary outcome of this study., RESULTS: A total of 92 pairs of imaging studies were performed in 82 patients during the study period. Five study pairs were excluded due to technical errors that prevented imaging interpretation. Females slightly predominated over males with a mean +/- SD age of 50.5 +/- 15.9 years and a mean body mass index of 29.6 +/- 8.6 kg/m2. Of the remaining 87 sets of studies 69 (79.3%) demonstrated concordant findings regarding ureteral patency for the 2 imaging techniques and 18 (20.7%) were discordant. The nephrostomy tube was removed on the same day in 15 of the 17 patients who demonstrated antegrade urine flow only on contrast enhanced ultrasound and they had no subsequent adverse events. No adverse events were noted related to ultrasound contrast injection. While contrast enhanced ultrasound used no ionizing radiation, fluoroscopic nephrostograms provided a mean radiation exposure dose of 2.8 +/- 3.7 mGy., CONCLUSIONS: A contrast enhanced ultrasound nephrostogram can be safely performed to evaluate for ureteral patency following percutaneous nephrolithotomy. This imaging technique was mostly concordant with fluoroscopic findings. Most discordance was likely attributable to the higher sensitivity for patency of contrast enhanced ultrasound compared to fluoroscopy.

2433,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included

The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included

The skin eruption was characterized by an atrophic rectangular plaque on the left upper back, presenting as mottled hyper- and hypopigmentation with reticulate telangiectasia. Histologically, the eruption demonstrated epidermal atrophy, hyalinized and irregularly stained collagen, and telangiectasia of superficial vessels in the dermis.

In particular, patients with long-standing IHD and numerous repeated catheterizations to only one or two occluded coronary arteries should be considered at high risk.",Excluded
837,"Radiation metabolomics. 5. Identification of urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in nonhuman primates by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has previously demonstrated utility for identifying biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in cellular, mouse and rat in vivo radiation models. To provide a valuable link from small laboratory rodents to humans, gamma-radiation-induced urinary biomarkers were investigated using a nonhuman primate total-body-irradiation model. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches were applied to determine whether biomarkers could be identified, as well as the previously discovered rodent biomarkers of gamma radiation. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a time course of clean-catch urine samples collected from nonhuman primates (n = 6 per cohort) exposed to sham, 1.0, 3.5, 6.5 or 8.5 Gy doses of (60)Co gamma ray (~0.55 Gy/min) ionizing radiation.

OBJECTIVE To validate our previously derived decision instrument (NEXUS Chest) for identification of blunt trauma patients with very low risk of thoracic injury seen on chest imaging (TICI).We hypothesized that NEXUS Chest would have high sensitivity (>98%) for the prediction of TICI and TICI with major clinical significance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 2009 to January 2012, we enrolled blunt trauma patients older than 14 years who received chest radiography in this prospective, observational, diagnostic decision instrument study at 9 US level I trauma centers. Prior to viewing radiographic results, physicians recorded the presence or absence of the NEXUS Chest 7 clinical criteria (age >60 years, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, abnormal alertness/mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness to chest wall palpation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thoracic injury seen on chest imagingwas defined as pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, and pulmonary contusion or laceration seen on radiographs. An expert panel generated an a priori classification of clinically major, minor, and insignificant TICIs according to associated management changes. RESULTS Of 9905 enrolled patients, 43.1%had a single CXR, 42.0% had CXR and chest CT, 6.7%had CXR and abdominal CT (without chest CT), 5.5%had multiple CXRs without CT, and 2.6%had chest CT alone in the emergency department. The most common trauma mechanisms were motorized vehicle crash (43.9%), fall (27.5%), pedestrian struck by motorized vehicle (10.7%), bicycle crash (6.3%), and struck by blunt object, fists, or kicked (5.8%). Thoracic injury seen on chest imaging was seen in 1478 (14.9%) patients with 363 (24.6%) of these having major clinical significance, 1079 (73.0%) minor clinical significance, and 36 (2.4%) no clinical significance. NEXUS Chest had a sensitivity of 98.8% (95%CI, 98.1%-99.3%), a negative predictive value of 98.5%(95%CI, 97.6%.6-99.1%), and a specificity of 13.3%(95%CI, 12.6%-14.1%) for TICI. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for TICI with clinically major injury were 99.7%(95%CI, 98.2%-100.0%) and 99.9% (95%CI, 99.4%-100.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We have validated the NEXUS Chest decision instrument, which may safely reduce the need for chest imaging in blunt trauma patients older than 14 years.",Excluded
2265,"Age effects in identifying and localising dichotic stimuli: a corpus callosum deficit? In the present study, dichotic listening performance of 31 older adults was compared with performance of 25 younger adults under free and focused attention conditions. In addition to an age-related general decrease in performance, we observed in the focused attention condition increased asymmetry in the elderly group: the decrease of recall performance was stronger for the left ear (LE) then for the right ear (RE), while the increase of localisation errors were greater for the RE than for LE. Identifying and localising digits appear to be different process mediated predominantly by the left and right hemisphere, respectively. Since age-related reduced performance is strongest for the ear ipsilateral to the hemisphere dominant to that particular function, these finding may be ascribed to decline of corpus callosum functioning resulting in decrease interhemispheric interaction rather than to a selective decline of right hemisphere functions.",Excluded
2397,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded
1914,"Identification of a novel three-column classification for double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius The present study aimed to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius according to imaging data, and to evaluate their clinical features. A retrospective analysis of imaging data derived from 498 patients diagnosed with a double-column die-punch fracture of the distal radius was performed. The fractures were divided into those with middle-column avulsion with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type I), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of the radial-column articular surface (type II), those with middle-column collapse with fracture of epiphysis of the radial column (type III) or mixed-type fractures (type IV). The intra- and inter-observer consistency between assessors was analyzed with kappa statistics. The patients with double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius were followed up. There were 21 cases of type I fracture, 135 cases of type II fracture, 130 cases of type III fracture and 212 cases of type IV fracture. The intra-observer kappa coefficient ranged from 0.810-0.861, whereas the inter-observer kappa coefficient range was 0.830-0.876, with high consistency. Following 13 months of follow-up, the patients were assessed for functional recovery of the wrist and hand using the Gartland-Werley scoring system. The analysis indicated that in 95.78% of the patients, wrist function was rated as excellent or good (n=477), while in 4.22% of patients it was rated as fair (n=21), mainly due to the development of post-traumatic arthritis of the wrist following inappropriate therapy. All of the cases were type IV and type III fractures. These data demonstrated the application of a novel classification system named the Three-Column Classification, used to classify double-column die-punch fractures of the distal radius. This method reflected the mechanisms and severity of the fractures, conforming to the principle of AO fracture classification. Furthermore, it exhibited high consistency and may provide reference values for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognostic evaluation.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

3288,"Coronary artery calcium: 0.5 mm slice-thickness reconstruction with adjusted attenuation threshold outperforms 3.0 mm by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) images can be reconstructed with thinner slice thickness on some modern multidetector-row computed tomography scanners without additional radiation. We hypothesized that the isotropic 0.5-mm CAC reconstruction outperforms the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction in detecting and quantifying coronary calcium, and we proposed to compare them by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter-virtual histology (IVUS-VH)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, and 5976 mm of coronary arteries were analyzed. A semiautomatic software was developed to coregister CAC and IVUS-VH on a detailed slice-by-slice basis. Calcium detection and calcium volume quantification were evaluated and compared using varying calcium attenuation thresholds. Algorithms for deriving individualized optimal threshold and comparable Agatston score on the 0.5-mm reconstruction were developed., RESULTS: The isotropic 0.5-mm reconstruction achieved significantly higher area under receiver-operating curve than the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction (0.9 vs. 0.74, P < .001). Using the optimal threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction had higher sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.65), specificity (0.85 vs. 0.77), positive predictive value (0.42 vs. 0.29), and negative predictive value (0.97 vs. 0.94) than the 3.0 mm. Individualized optimal threshold was significantly correlated with the image noise (r = 0.66, P < .001) in the 0.5-mm reconstruction., CONCLUSIONS: By optimizing the calcium threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction is superior to the conventional 3.0-mm in detecting and quantifying calcium, which may improve the clinical value of CAC without additional radiation.

1482,"Comparison of ultrasound-assisted and pure fluoroscopy-guided extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for renal stones Background: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and clinical outcomes of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for patients with renal stones using pure fluoroscopy (FS) or ultrasound-assisted (USa) localization with two lithotripters. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 425 patients with renal calculi who underwent SWL with either a LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter (209 cases), which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting or a Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter machine (216 cases), which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking. The patient demographic data, stone-free rates, stone disintegration rates, retreatment rates and complication rates were analyzed. Result(s): The USa group had a significantly higher overall stone-free rate (43.6 vs. 28.2%, p < 0.001) and stone disintegration rate (85.6 vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001), as well as a significantly lower retreatment rate (14.8 vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001) and complication rate (1.9 vs. 5.5%, p = 0.031) compared with the FS group. This superiority remained significant in the stone size < 1 cm stratified group. In the stone size > 1 cm group, the stone-free rate (32.4 vs. 17.8%, p = 0.028), disintegration rate (89.2 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.031) and retreatment rate (21.6 vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001) were still significantly better in the USa group, however there was no significant difference in the complication rate. The most common complication was post-SWL-related flank pain. Conclusion(s): SWL is a safe and non-invasive way of treating renal stones. This study compared two electromagnetic shock wave machines with different stone tracking systems. LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter, which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting outperformed Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter, which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking, with better stone-free rates and disintegration rates, as well as lower retreatment rates and complications with possible reduced radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Although uncertainties are inherent in this risk assessment, the present evidence warrants identifying homes that have unacceptably high concentrations.",Excluded
2796,"Increased protoporphyrin IX accumulation does not improve the effect of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratosis: a randomized controlled trial Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) is highly effective for treating actinic keratosis (AK) on the face/scalp, but less effective on the extremities. Insufficient accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) may cause these inferior efficacy rates. However, it is possible to increase PpIX accumulation by extending the MAL application time and/or pretreating the skin with curettage. Objective(s): To investigate whether increased PpIX accumulation improves the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs in a randomized intra-individual study. Method(s): Twenty-two patients with 533 AKs on both hands were treated with MAL-PDT. To obtain different concentrations of PpIX, four symmetrical areas on each patient were randomly allocated to different regimens: (i) 3-h MAL application without prior curettage (3hC-); (ii) 3 h with curettage (3hC+); (iii) 21 h without curettage (21hC-); and (iv) 21 h with curettage (21hC+). Treatment efficacy was evaluated after 3 months, whereas PpIX fluorescence, pain and erythema were assessed during and after PDT. Result(s): Extended MAL application with and without curettage increased PpIX accumulation significantly compared with the standard 3hC+ regimen (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). However, the median total clearance rates did not improve accordingly: 3hC+ (55.0%), 21hC- (55.0%) and 21hC+ (53.6%). Conversely, insufficient PpIX accumulation in the 3hC- regimen led to a significantly lower clearance rate (33.3%) than the other regimens (P < 0.045). Furthermore, pain and erythema were correlated to PpIX accumulation. Conclusion(s): Increased PpIX accumulation does not improve the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs on the hands, but leads to worse adverse events. Different strategies are needed to improve PDT on the extremities.Copyright © 2016 British Association of Dermatologists",Excluded
1689,"XPA-deficiency in hairless mice causes a shift in skin tumor types and mutational target genes after exposure to low doses of U.V.B Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with a defect in the nucleotide excision repair gene XPA, develop tumors with a high frequency on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Here we describe that hairless XPA-deficient mice also develop skin tumors with a short latency time and a 100% prevalence after daily exposure to low doses of U.V.B. Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded
2979,"The thermal effects of therapeutic lasers with 810 and 904 nm wavelengths on human skin OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of therapeutic infrared class 3B laser irradiation on skin temperature in healthy participants of differing skin color, age, and gender., BACKGROUND: Little is known about the potential thermal effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) irradiation on human skin., METHODS: Skin temperature was measured in 40 healthy volunteers with a thermographic camera at laser irradiated and control (non-irradiated) areas on the skin. Six irradiation doses (2-12 J) were delivered from a 200 mW, 810 nm laser and a 60 mW, 904 nm laser, respectively., RESULTS: Thermal effects of therapeutic LLLT using doses recommended in the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT) guidelines were insignificant; below 1.5degreeC in light, medium, and dark skin. When higher irradiation doses were used, the 60 mW, 904 nm laser produced significantly (p < 0.01) higher temperatures in dark skin (5.7, SD +/- 1.8degreeC at 12 J) than in light skin, although no participants requested termination of LLLT. However, irradiation with a 200 mW, 810 nm laser induced three to six times more heat in dark skin than in the other skin color groups. Eight of 13 participants with dark skin asked for LLLT to be stopped because of uncomfortable heating. The maximal increase in skin temperature was 22.3degreeC., CONCLUSIONS: The thermal effects of LLLT at doses recommended by WALT-guidelines for musculoskeletal and inflammatory conditions are negligible (<1.5degreeC) in light, medium, and dark skin. However, higher LLLT doses delivered with a strong 3B laser (200 mW) are capable of increasing skin temperature significantly and these photothermal effects may exceed the thermal pain threshold for humans with dark skin color.",Excluded
2283,"Elevated Radiation Exposure Associated With Above Surface Flat Detector Mini C-Arm Use Background: This study aims to test the hypothesis that: (1) radiation exposure is increased with the intended use of Flat Surface Image Intensifier (FSII) units above the operative surface compared with the traditional below-table configuration; (2) this differential increases in a dose-dependent manner; and (3) radiation exposure varies with body part and proximity to the radiation source. Methods: A surgeon mannequin was seated at a radiolucent hand table, positioned for volar distal radius plating. Thermoluminescent dosimeters measured exposure to the eyes, thyroid, chest, hand, and groin, for 1- and 15-minute trials from a mini C-arm FSII unit positioned above and below the operating surface. Background radiation was measured by control dosimeters placed within the operating theater. Results: At 1-minute of exposure, hand and eye dosages were significantly greater with the flat detector positioned above the table. At 15-minutes of exposure, hand radiation dosage exceeded that of all other anatomic sites with the FSII in both positions. Hand exposure was increased in a dose-dependent manner with the flat detector in either position, whereas groin exposure saw a dose-dependent only with the flat detector beneath the operating table. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the surgeon's hands and eyes may incur greater radiation exposure compared with other body parts, during routine mini C-arm FSII utilization in its intended position above the operating table. The clinical impact of these findings remains unclear, and future long-term radiation safety investigation is warranted. Surgeons should take precautions to protect critical body parts, particularly when using FSII technology above the operating with prolonged exposure time.",Excluded
1848,"Hand osteoid osteoma: Evaluation of diagnosis and treatment Background: OO (osteoid osteoma) is a common, osteoblastic, benign bone tumor but rarely seen in the hand region. There is still some debate about the diagnosis and treatment of hand OOs. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the epidemiology, radiologic features, surgical treatment options and functional outcomes. Method(s): Between January 2003 and December 2014, surgically treated and pathologically verified 9 hand OO cases were investigated retrospectively. The preoperative and postoperative clinical outcome scores were calculated using the M2-DASH (Manchester-Modified Disabilities of Arm Shoulder and Hand) Score. Result(s): Lesion locations were as follows: middle phalanx in 2/9 (22%) patients (2nd and 4th digit), proximal phalanx in 6/9 (67%) patients (one 4th, two 2nd and three 5th digits) and metacarpal (2nd) in 1/9 (11%) patient. Incidence of nidus formation was 6/9 (67%) on X-ray, 7/9 (78%) on CT imaging and 2/9 (22%) on MR imaging. The mean time to diagnosis was 13.22 +/- 5.44 months. Preoperative mean M2-DASH score was 41 +/- 6 and postoperative was 7.4 +/- 8.6. Conclusion(s): Osteoid osteoma is usually seen below 25 years, and rarely found over 40 years of age. There is male dominance with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Delay of diagnosis may be encountered because of many differential diagnoses. When OO is suspected, CT imaging should be taken before the MR imaging. Because of superiority in soft tissue imaging, MR imaging should be an alternative tool in complex cases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded

OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate whether vertebroplasty combined with anti-osteoporosis treatment can reduce refracture rate following osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures. METHOD(S): Eighty-nine patients with osteoporotic vertebral compressive fractures undergoing vertebroplasty were divided into control group (n=38) and treatment group (n=51) after making an informed choice about treatment. Chest/lumbar X-ray and bone mineral density determinations were performed through outpatient or inpatient follow-up. The spinal stability, bone mineral density and refracture rate of patients in both groups were followed up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Seventy-eight patients achieved complete follow-up (ranged from 6-39 months, average 26.73 months). There was no significant difference in the spinal stability between both groups (P > 0.05), while rare bone trabecula was found in the control group. There was a significant difference in bone mineral density between both groups at postoperative 12, 24, and 36 months (P < 0.05). The refracture rate in the treatment group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05).

2301,"Evaluation of the reticulocyte micronucleus assay in patients treated with radioiodine for thyroid cancer In the case of accidental radiation exposure, biological dosimetry has an important role. Previous studies have indicated that the flow cytometric micronucleus (MN) assay in human transferrin receptor positive reticulocytes (Tf-Ret) in blood could be a sensitive biomarker for chromosome damage. In the present investigation, the utility and sensitivity of this method was studied in 44 young patients from Belarus, who were treated with 131I for thyroid cancer. Red marrow (RM) is the critical organ in radioiodine therapy (RIT). In our patients, it was exposed to 100-700 mSv low-dose rate irradiation within 2-4 days. About 3 days after 131I administration, the frequency of micronucleated-Tf-Ret (f(MN-Tf-Ret)) increases within 1 day to a maximum and declines in the following 2-5 days to its value before treatment. A total dose of 100 mSv was easily detectable. The sensitivity of the assay after acute irradiation may be 50 mSv. The method should be useful for monitoring individuals after a radiation accident, provided blood samples can be obtained within a few days after exposure. The time-course of f(MN-Tf-Ret) is interpreted using a model, which considers the exponential exposure of red marrow in RIT as well as the kinetics of erythroblast maturation and reticulocyte migration into the peripheral circulation. Similar modelling was done on published data of MN in immature mouse erythrocytes. Striking similarities in the kinetic and in the yield of MN-induction were found between these two species. This lends support for the use of the mouse as a model for the MN-induction in humans.",Excluded

Patients A total of 265 consecutive patients with toxic nodular goitre were treated between March 2003 and August 2004 at our institute and followed up for a maximum of 8 years. Preliminary radioiodine testing with volumetric measurement of the thyroid by ultrasound as well as individual thyroidal radioiodine uptake and half-life measurements were performed before radioiodine therapy. The estimated radiation dose to the thyroid was 150 Gy. Measurements Follow-up controls with respect to success of therapy and development of hypothyroidism were performed 3 months, 1 and up to 8 years after radioiodine treatment. The relation of the achieved thyroid dose to the success rate of treatment and to the incidence of hypothyroidism was analysed. Results The cure rates were 85% at 3 months, 98% at 1 year and 98% at the end of follow-up. Above an achieved thyroid dose of more than 120 Gy, there was no significant association between the dose achieved in the thyroid and the cure rate on follow-up. The incidences of hypothyroidism at 3 months, at 1 year and at the end of follow-up were 32%, 55% and 73%, respectively. Conclusions Radioiodine treatment with a calculated dose regimen is a highly effective treatment option in patients with toxic goitre with an overall success rate of 98%. However, radioiodine treatment with an intended thyroid dose of 150 Gy leads to a high incidence of hypothyroidism on long-term follow-up. This finding supports the suggestion that in future intended thyroid doses could be lowered in patients treated with a calculated dose regimen for toxic nodular goitre. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Excluded

Better normal tissue sparing might be achieved with scanned carbon ion therapy (PT). Therefore an in silico trial was conducted to find potential advantages of and patients suited for PT. Methods For 19 patients treated with SBRT, PT plans were calculated on 4D-CTs with simulated breathing motion. Prescribed single fraction dose was 24 Gy and OAR constraints used for photon planning were respected. Motion was mitigated by rescanning and range-adapted ITVs. Doses were compared to the original SBRT plans. Results CTV coverage was the same in SBRT and PT. The field-specific PTV including range margins for PT was 1.5 (median, 25-75% 1.3-2.1) times larger than for SBRT. Nevertheless, maximum point dose and mean dose in OARs were higher in SBRT by 2.8 (1.6-3.7) Gy and 0.7 (0.3-1.6) Gy, respectively. Patients with a CTV >2.5 cc or with multiple lung lesions showed larger differences in OAR doses in favor of PT. Conclusions Patients receive less dose in critical OARs such as heart, spinal cord, esophagus, trachea and aorta with PT, while maintaining the same target coverage.

2649,"Low-Dose Coronary CT Angiography in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: Comparison of Image Quality and Radiation Exposure with Two Different Approaches Rationale and Objectives: To evaluate image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA)performed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)with the latest scanner generation, comparing two different technical approaches. A new scanner that combines a 0.23 mm spatial resolution, a new generation of iterative reconstruction, fast gantry rotation time and the intracycle motion-correction algorithm to improve the temporal resolution was recently introduced in the clinical field. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled 105 consecutive patients with chronic AF who performed CCTA with a whole-heart coverage high-definition CT scanner (16-cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows, 0.28 s gantry rotation time). Five of them were excluded for impaired renal function. Patients were randomized between a double acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 1)or a single acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 2). The image quality, coronary segment interpretability and effective dose (ED)of CCTA were assessed. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 85.6+/-21 bpm in group 1 vs. 83.7+/-23 bpm in Group 2, respectively (p < ns). In group 2, overall image quality was high and comparable with that of group 1 (Likert scale =3.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 1.2, p = ns, in group 1 and 2, respectively). Coronary interpretability was high and similar between the two groups (97.5% and 97.1% in group 1 and 2, p = ns, respectively). Mean ED was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (5.3 +/- 1.8 mSv vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7 mSv, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): The novel whole-heart coverage CT scanner allows to perform CCTA with a single-acquisition protocol with high image quality and low radiation exposure in AF patients.Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists",Excluded
2376,"The benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy Background: Many patients with cancer experience depression and anxiety, and an associated decrease in quality of life (QOL) during radiation therapy (RT). The main objective of the study was to determine the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients who received RT. Method(s): Patients with cancer (n = 178) who agreed to participate in the study were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 89) or the control arm (n = 89). Patients in the intervention group received psychosocial care during RT, whereas the control group received RT only. The benefits of the intervention were evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) to survey health-related QOL. The association between intervention and survival was also assessed. Result(s): Patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm showed significant improvements on symptoms of depression (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05), health-related QOL (p < 0.05) (i.e. better global health status, and physical and emotional functioning, and less insomnia) when compared with controls. In the subset analysis, female patients, those that received high dose irradiation, and those that underwent adjuvant chemotherapy could benefit more from psychosocial intervention. There was no difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (2-year DFS 79.8% in the intervention arm and 76.4% in the control arm; p = 0.527) and overall survival (OS) (2-year OS 83.1% in the intervention arm and 84.3% in the control arm; p = 0.925). Conclusion(s): Psychosocial intervention is a cost-effective approach that can improve a patient's mood and QOL both during and after RT. However, the intervention was not found to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death. © 2013 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
711,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded
2307,"Energy and thermal regulation during bed rest and spaceflight In planning for long-duration (1- to 2-yr) space missions (microgravity), the availability of oxygen, water, and food is critical for survival. If astronauts would consume approximately 3,100 kcal and 2.2 liters of fluid per day, the requirements for a 2-yr flight would be 2,263,000 kcal and 1,606 liters for each astronaut. These estimates, based on limited microgravity simulation and flight data, include 1 h/day of moderate isotonic exercise. Each 30-min/day reduction in exercise training time would save 110,869 kcal and 91 liters of water per year. One daily 5-h extravehicular sortie at an average work rate of 1.7 l/min would require an additional 529,250 kcal and 1,095 liters of water per year. Results from microgravity simulation (bed rest) experiments suggest that 1) there is uncertainty whether basal metabolism is unchanged, 2) submaximal ergometer exercise oxygen uptake appears to be unchanged or lower, and 3) without vigorous exercise training near peak levels, the peak oxygen uptake is definitely reduced. In addition, the equilibrium level of exercise core temperature is elevated excessively by approximately 0.5 degrees C after bed-rest acclimation. Changes in the efficiency of work or metabolism in any or all of these conditions could affect nutritional requirements for long spaceflights. Further research is necessary to elucidate the metabolic factors that would be changed and the energy cost of intra- and extravehicular activity during prolonged exposure to microgravity.",Excluded
1629,"Trend dynamics of thyroid cancer incidence among China and the U.S. adult population from 1990 to 2017: a joinpoint and age-period-cohort analysis BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common malignant disease of the endocrine system. Based on the previously published reports, the incidence of TC has been increasing in the past 25 years, and the reason for the increase is not yet clear. The present study aims to reveal the long-term trends and age-period-cohort effects for the incidence of TC in China and the U.S. from 1990 to 2017., METHODS: We examined the trends of TC incidence and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of rate using the Joinpoint regression analysis in the two countries, for the different genders (men/women) in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2017). We further used an age-period-cohort model to analyze age-period-cohort effects on TC incidence., RESULTS: The ASIR of China increased markedly with AAPC of 4.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0, 5.0%) and 1.8% (1.6, 2.0%) for men and women during 1990-2017. The ASIR of the U. S increased by 1.4% (1.0, 1.8%) and 1.3% (0.9, 1.7%) for men and women from 1990 to 2017.TC increased with the age and period. Aging was one of the most influential factors of TC in China. The age effect increased markedly in the U.S. compared with China. The period effect showed an increase in China while that tended to grow steadily during 1990-2017 in the U.S. The cohort effect peaked in 1963-1967 birth cohorts for men and women in China and declined consistently in the birth cohort in the U.S., CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2017, due to ionizing radiation and over-diagnosis, age-standardized TC incidence rates in both genders rose in China and the U.S. The standardized incidence rate of women is higher than that of men. It is necessary to provide women with reasonable prevention and protection measures for TC. We need to apply for health services and screening to reduce ionizing radiation.",Excluded
2253,"8 Gy single-dose radiotherapy is effective in metastatic spinal cord compression: Results of a phase III randomized multicentre Italian trial Background and purpose: In a previous randomized trial we showed that the short-course radiotherapy (RT) regimen of 8 Gy x 2 was feasible in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) and short life expectancy. This phase III trial was planned to determine whether in the same category of patients 8 Gy single-dose is as effective as 8 Gy x 2. Material(s) and Method(s): Three hundred and twenty-seven patients with MSCC and short life expectancy were randomly assigned to a short-course of 8 Gy x 2 or to 8 Gy single-dose RT. Median follow-up was 31 months (range, 4-58). Result(s): A total of 303 (93%) patients are assessable, 150 treated with the short-course and 153 with the single-dose RT. No difference in response was found between the two RT schedules adopted. Median duration of response was 5 and 4.5 months for short-course and single-dose RT (p = 0.4), respectively. The median overall survival was 4 months for all cases. Light acute toxicity was registered in a minority of cases. Late toxicity was never recorded. Conclusion(s): Both RT schedules adopted were effective. As already shown in several trials evaluating RT regimens in uncomplicated painful bone metastases, also MSCC patients may achieve palliation with minimal toxicity and inconvenience with a single-dose of 8 Gy. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2952,"Removal of Antiscatter Grids for Spinal Digital Subtraction Angiography: Dose Reduction without Loss of Diagnostic Value Background Spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) exposes patients and operators to substantial amounts of radiation. Antiscatter grid (ASG) removal is used to decrease radiation exposure but may reduce image quality. Purpose To determine whether ASG removal during spinal DSA in adults reduces radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality and whether dose reduction is related to body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study included adults undergoing spinal DSA between January and December 2016. Each procedure included an additional angiographic acquisition performed twice, once with and once without ASG, either documenting the artery of Adamkiewicz (no pathology group) or the condition leading to the procedure (pathology group). Dose differences between study acquisitions and the influence of BMI were evaluated via paired t test. Two neurointerventionalists blinded to acquisition protocols were asked to independently evaluate a sample of 40 study acquisitions (20 with ASG, 20 without ASG) from 20 randomly selected participants to (a) rate image quality, (b) categorize findings, and (c) determine whether images had been obtained with or without ASG. Percentage agreement on image quality, findings categorization, and ability to correctly identify the acquisition protocol was calculated for both readers. Results Fifty-three participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 51 years +/- 15.2; 32 men) were evaluated. ASG removal reduced the mean dose per acquisition by approximately 33% (mean dose-area product and air kerma decreased from 202 to 135.6 microGy/m2 and from 35.3 to 24 mGy, respectively; P < .001) independently of BMI (P = .3). Both readers evaluated all images (40 of 40) as being of diagnostic quality and correctly categorized findings in 19 of 20 (95%) cases. Overall percentage agreement for correct protocol identification was 60% (12 of 20) for grid-in and 45% (nine of 20) for grid-out images. Conclusion Antiscatter grid removal during spinal digital subtraction angiography decreased participants' radiation exposure while preserving diagnostic image quality. © RSNA, 2020.",Excluded
1227,"The relationship of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration with clinical variables in patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia Background & aims: The relationship between vitamin D and oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration in patients with OD and to verify its association to nutritional status, functional independence measure (FIM), time of clinical signs (TCS) and OD severity. This is a cross-sectional study conducted with outpatients. Body mass index (BMI), FIM, TCS, causes of OD, comorbidities, penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) and severity scale were evaluated. Method(s): A multiple linear regression and effect size were performed to evaluate the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and independent variables. Result(s): Forty-eight participants were included, with a mean age of 60.1 +/- 15.3 years. The mean of the 25(OH)D concentration was 26.10 +/- 12.0 ng/mL. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (<30 ng/mL) was 73%. In the multiple linear regression analysis (adjusted for sex, age, BMI, dietary intake and solar radiation), 25(OH)D concentration was significantly related with the TCS (p = 0.01, f2 = 0.48). Patients with hypovitaminosis D had a moderate effect (p = 0.08, delta = 0.36) for a lower FIM score. Conclusion(s): These findings indicate that serum 25(OH)D concentration may be related to the TCS and the functional capacity of patients with OD.Copyright © 2020 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism",Excluded
2742,"Is it necessary to approach the severe osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture bilaterally during the process of pkp? Purpose: The goal of this study was to explore the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral approach percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using CT-guidance in the treatment of severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients with severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture who had undergone unilateral and bilateral PKP surgeries using CT-guidance at our hospital between June 2013 and June 2019, and followed for at least 1 year. All patients were divided into unilateral (the transverse process-pedicle approach, n = 49) and bilateral (the pedicle approach, n = 40) groups. We collected the clinical and radiological evaluation results during postoperative and last follow-up periods. Result(s): Our findings revealed that the surgery time for the unilateral group was significantly shorter than that of the bilateral group at P < 0.05. The amount of bone cement and radiation exposure of the unilateral group were significantly lesser than that of the bilateral group (P < 0.05). Relative to preoperative data, the values of the VAS score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were significantly improved at 1 day after surgery and the last followup in the two groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the median height of vertebra at 1 day after surgery and the last follow-up in the unilateral group was significantly restored than that of preoperative data (P < 0.05). However, the median height of vertebra at the same time intervals in the bilateral group showed no significant change compared with preoperative data (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of bone cement leakage and incidence of adjacent-level vertebra fracture were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). Finally, both groups can obtain an asymmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra. Conclusion(s): Compared to the bilateral PKP, unilateral PKP using CT-guidance in the treatment of the sOVBFs exhibits significantly shorter operation time, lesser radiation dose, and complications. Moreover, unilateral PKP can restore the median height of the vertebral body and eventually obtain a symmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra.Copyright © 2021 Tan et al.",Excluded
165,"Abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): proof of principle in an experimental model of colon cancer The aim of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3. The present study performed in a simple animal model provides proof of principle that the positive response of a tumor to BNCT is capable of inducing an abscopal effect.",Excluded
981,"Reducing radiation exposure during invasive coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions implementing a simple four-step protocol Background: With an increasing number of complex and repeated percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), radiation-induced hazards for patients and operators remain an important issue in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Our objective was to evaluate radiation exposure during coronary angiographic procedures and assess the efficacy of a four-step program to reduce radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CAG) and PCI. Methods and Results: A retrospective single-center analysis was performed in patients undergoing CAG or PCI in the first 6 months of 2012 vs. the first 6 months of 2014 (n = 3,107 procedures). During 2013, a four-step protocol was established in our hospital. It contained measures to reduce radiation exposure, including a frame rate reduction from 15 to 7.5 frames per second, the use of fluoroscopy storage, strict use of beam collimation, and repeat training on radiation safety. After adjustment for confounding variables, a dose-area product (DAP) reduction of 54.2 % was observed subsequent to implementation of the four-step protocol. Independent predictors of DAP were age [odds ratio (OR) 1.01], body surface area (OR 5.47), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.44), radial access (OR 1.16), PCI (OR 2.36), female gender (OR 0.91), and the implementation of the four-step program (OR 0.46). Conclusion(s): A simple four-step protocol led to a significant reduction in radiation exposure in diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures without significant drawbacks in image quality. Hence, radiation safety programs are of paramount importance and should be established to improve patient and operator safety with regard to radiation-induced hazards.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
849,"Quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography for prediction of pain relief in metastatic bone disease treated with rhenium-186 etidronate PURPOSE: To calculate radiation doses of rhenium-186 ((186)Re) etidronate in painful bone metastases using quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to determine the threshold dose for predicting pain relief. We also wanted to determine whether technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) concentrations predict radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful lesions., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Patients received therapeutic doses of (186)Re etidronate. The area under the pain over time curve (AUPC) was measured for 8 weeks after treatment. Response was calculated as the percentage of change in AUPC. Quantitative bone SPECT (QBS)-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate was used for calculating radiation doses. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis determined the radiation dose threshold that best separated responders from nonresponders. SPECT-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate in the urinary bladder was correlated with its concentration in the voided urine. Concentration of (99m)Tc MDP was compared with radiation doses to painful metastases., RESULTS: The radiation dose threshold was 2.10 Gy. For a decrease of 50% in the AUPC, the positive predictive value (PPV) of this value was 75% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88%. For a decrease in pain of 33%, the PPV was 84% and the NPV was 81%. In prostate cancer patients only, the PPV was 81% and the NPV was 92%. The correlation between in vivo/in vitro measured urine concentration was 0.90. The correlation between (99m)Tc MDP concentration and radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate was 0.92., CONCLUSION: QBS-measured radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful metastases are a good predictor of pain relief.

1389,"[Radiological determination of femoral rotation deformity--computerized tomography, optimized measurement accuracy and exposure dosage] 58 Patients, suspicious to have rotation deformity of the femur, were examined. To compare the value of diagnostic methods in measuring the degree of malrotation we estimated this degree using clinical examination and calculated the anteversion of the femoral neck, taking radiographs in the technique of Dunn and Rippstein, and a modified method of computed tomography. Only in twelve cases the direction of malrotation was corresponding in all three methods, although considerable variations in quantitative results were noted. Maintaining the exact position of the patient, necessary to get reproducible results using conventional X-ray technique, was impossible in most cases of patients with posttraumatic joint-stiffness and malalignment. Determination of femoral neck anteversion using this modified method of CT is a quick, reproducible technique to calculate the degree of malrotation, insensitive to the position of the patient. By means of this CT method it was possible to approach the highest accuracy in precise preoperative planing. Furthermore the radiation exposure could be reduced in a range of 20%-40%.",Excluded

One hundred fifteen (24%) were considered candidates for direct stenting. Out of 150 coronary lesions, 119 (79%) had direct coronary stenting. In 5% patients stent could not be passed across the lesion. These stents were withdrawn without stent damage and after predilatation the same were successfully deployed., RESULTS: Primary success rate was 95%. Angiographically assessed success was achieved in all patients with immediate TIMI 111 flow in 97%. The vessels directly stented were LAD 53%, RCA 27% and LCX 18%. Two saphenous vein grafts were also directly stented. The coronary lesions stented were type A 36%, B1 54% and B2 10%. In borderline lesions IVUS was used for quantification of stenosis. There was no in-hospital death, MI or emergency CABG. Compared to traditional stenting there was 46% reduction in procedure time, 62% reduction in radiation exposure time and 35% decrease in use of contrast media. There was also significant (18%) cost benefit in direct stenting., CONCLUSION: This study supports the view that direct coronary stenting is feasible and a safe procedure in our population with additional benefits of cost reduction by 18%.

1282,"Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic signaling PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the LDR exposure.",Included
390,"Diet and melanoma in a case-control study Background: Malignant melanoma has been one of the most rapidly increasing cancers within the United States with few modifiable risk factors. This study investigates risk related to dietary factors, which are potentially modifiable. Method(s): Newly diagnosed patients with melanoma (n = 502) were recruited from pigment lesion clinics and controls (n = 565) were recruited from outpatient clinics. To investigate the relationship between melanoma and dietary factors in this case-control study, study subjects were requested to complete a food frequency questionnaire, which assessed diet over the previous year. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) for melanoma were computed for nutrient and alcohol intake. Result(s): Persons in high versus low quintiles of energy-adjusted vitamin D, alphacarotene, beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein, and lycopene had significantly reduced risk for melanoma (ORs <= 0.67), which remained after adjustment for presence of dysplastic nevi, education, and skin response to repeated sun exposure. Addition of micronutrients from supplements did not add an additional reduction in risk. High alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk for melanoma, which remained after adjustment for confounders [OR (95% confidence interval) in highest versus lowest quintiles, 1.65 (1.09-2.49)]. Conclusion(s): Diets consisting of foods rich in vitamin D and carotenoids and low in alcohol may be associated with a reduction in risk for melanoma.

The dose delivered was 45 Gy (1.80 Gy per fraction) in IMRT technique. Concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy at 225 mg/m(2) was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Primary endpoints were acute gastrointestinal toxicity (CTC 4.0) and technical feasibility of IMRT in regard to dose planning and radiation delivery., RESULTS: Early acute events were defined as clinical and chemical adverse effects of IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy during treatment. By definition, 90 days after the end of IMRT has been evaluated as acute-phase toxicity. No patient had grade 4 or higher acute adverse events. Clinical grade 3 toxicity occurred in two patients (8%) with diarrhea and in one case (4%) with nausea. Hematological changes with grade 3 occurred in three cases (12%) with hemoglobin decrease, in five cases (25%) as leukopenia, and in one case (4%) with thrombocytopenia. The mean dose for liver was 16 Gy and the percentage volume exceeding 30 Gy (V30) was 21%. Mean dose for right and left kidney was 9 and 13 Gy, respectively, and V20 was 9% and 13%, respectively. Heart received a median dose of 15 Gy and V40 was 17%. The mean dose to the bowel was 11 Gy and V40 was 6%. Spinal cord had at maximum 33 Gy in median. Specifics of dose distribution, including the coverage, for the target region were as follows: minimum was 33 Gy, maximum 48.6 Gy, and mean dose 44.6 Gy. The prescribed dose (45 Gy) covered 99% and 95% of planning target volume (OTV) in 66% and 92% of cases, respectively. Median PTV was 15.77 ml (range, 805-3,604 ml)., CONCLUSIONS: The data support the practical feasibility of IMRT in adjuvant treatment in high-risk gastric cancer in the postoperative setting as a proof of principle.

1506,"Validation of a Dose Assessment Method to be Used in 18F FDG Loose Contamination Exercises ABSTRACT: Radiological emergency response may require responders to operate in contaminated environments. To provide more realistic training to these individuals, it has been proposed to disperse low amounts of short-lived radioactive material in simulated emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the applicability and safety of such activities, a limited exercise was conducted where 18F was sprayed in a small area and survey activities were executed. A pre-job external radiation exposure dose assessment was performed in preparation for this training. The research presented here compares participant external recorded doses to assessment results in order to validate the dose estimates. Two individuals were used during the dispersion, search, and survey activities. First, a radiation worker mixed 200 MBq Fludeoxyglucose 18F with 470 mL H2O in a weed sprayer and distributed it over a 3 m x 3 m area. After evaporation, an exercise participant performed search and survey activities in the area. Actual whole-body doses measured with optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters were 10 +/- 1 muSv for both personnel. Whole-body digital dosimeters read 4.3 +/- 0.2 muSv and 3.3 +/- 0.5 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. Actual extremity doses were below the dosimeters' minimum detectable limits for the radiation worker (thermoluminescence dosimeter) and exercise participant (optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter). The dose assessment-predicted whole-body doses were 2.8 +/- 0.4 muSv and 3.2 +/- 0.1 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. The estimated dose to the radiation worker's hand was 21.8 +/- 3.8 muSv, and the estimated dose to the exercise participant's knee was 13.4 +/- 0.6 muSv. The study provided substantial evidence for the validity of the dose assessment method, supporting its use for a larger training exercise.Copyright © 2021 Health Physics Society.",Excluded
2059,"Cell cycle radiosensitivity of progeny of irradiated primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells Aim: To evaluate the change of growth characteristics and radiosensitivity of irradiated primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells. Method(s): All tumor tissue samples were obtained from 39 hepatocarcinoma patients with a mean age of 49.6 years (range 22-76 years). We divided the samples into irradiated group and non-irradiated group and measured their plating efficiency (PE), population doubling time (PDT), radiosensitivity index SF2 and cell cycle. Result(s): The PDT of primary culture of hepatocarcinoma cells was 91.0+/-6.6 h, PE was 12.0+/-1.4%, SF2 was 0.41+/-0.05%. The PDT of their irradiated progeny was 124.8+/-5.8 h, PE was 5.0+/-0.7%, SF2 was 0.65+/-0.09%. The primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells showed significant S reduction and G2 arrest in a dose-dependent manner. The progeny of irradiated primary cultured hepatocarcinoma cells grew more slowly and its radiosensitivity increased. Conclusion(s): The progeny of irradiated primary cultured human hepatocarcinoma cells grows more slowly and its radiosensitivity increases. ©2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

2349,"The features of bone metabolism in patients with periodontal diseases Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women). BAP show significant differences between groups. The level of DPD in the GP group (5.78+/-0.79 mmol in men, 8.34+/-0.56 mmol in women) was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to HPS group (3.57+/-1.12 mmol in men, 4.47+/-0.76 mmol in women). Conclusions These results suggest that periodontitis associations with bone metabolic disturbances. In patients with periodontitis unbalanced bone remodeling was found: decreased bone formation and increased resorption.",Excluded
2772,"Pulmonary lymphoma identified as a result of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer PURPOSE: To describe the frequency and findings of pulmonary lymphoma in asymptomatic people undergoing computed tomographic (CT) screening for lung cancer., METHODS: All lymphoma diagnoses resulting from CT screening of 31 567 at-risk subjects (median age, 61 years) were identified, and the CT images were reviewed to document the lesions as to number, location, density, shape, and margin. The presence of lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion was also documented., RESULTS: Five patients with pulmonary lymphoma were identified. The lymphoma was a B-cell lymphoma in three, Hodgkin's lymphoma in one, and malignant lymphoma in one; it was primary in four and secondary in one. One patient had two lesions; the other four patients each had one lesion. Four of the six lesions were a mass, and two were a nodule. Four of the lesions had irregular margins. Air bronchograms were seen in three. Growth assessment was useful in leading to decisions for biopsy., CONCLUSION: In a context of CT screening to detect lung cancer in asymptomatic volunteers, the diagnosis of pulmonary lymphoma was rare but, nevertheless, occurred in five (.016%) of 31 567 volunteers.",Excluded
591,"Predictors of pulmonary toxicity in limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 70Gy daily radiotherapy: CALGB 30904 Introduction: Standard therapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (L-SCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. Predictors of post chemoradiotherapy pulmonary toxicity in limited stage (LS) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients are not well defined. Current guidelines are derived from non-small cell lung cancer regimens, and do not account for the unique biology of this disease. Therefore, we analyzed patients on three consecutive CALGB LS-SCLC trials treated with concurrent chemotherapy and daily high dose radiotherapy (70. Gy) to determine patient and treatment related factors predicting for post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Method(s): Patients treated on CALGB protocols 39808, 30002, 30206 investigating two cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and 70. Gy daily thoracic radiation therapy were pooled. Patient, tumor, and treatment related factors were evaluated to determine predictors of grade 3-5 pulmonary toxicities after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): 100 patients were included. No patient experienced grade 4-5 post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Patients who experienced post-treatment pulmonary toxicity were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs 60, p= 0.09) and have smaller total lung volumes (2565 cc vs 3530 cc, p= 0.05).). Furthermore, exposure of larger volumes of lung to lower (median V5. = 70%, p= 0.09, median V10. = 63%, p= 0.07), intermediate (median V20. = 50, p= 0.04) and high (median V60. = 25%, p= 0.01) doses of radiation were all associated with post-treatment grade 3 pulmonary toxicity, as was a larger mean lung radiation dose (median 31. Gy) p= 0.019. Conclusion(s): Post-treatment pulmonary toxicity following the completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and high dose daily radiation therapy was uncommon. Care should be taken to minimize mean lung radiation exposure, as well as volumes of low, intermediate and high doses of radiation. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
2642,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included
657,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included
3390,"Effects of X-irradiation on the immune response of guinea pigs to Q fever vaccine The immune response of guinea pigs to Q fever vaccine following 75 to 250 R (60 to 180 rads) of acute whole-body irradiations was investigated. Complement-fixing (CF) antibody titers and protection against febrile response to challenge with virulent Coxiella burnetii were studied. Exposures ranging from 75 to 250 R, 24 hours prior to inoculation, did not detectably alter the CF antibody response. Similar results were observed with 175 R delivered 48 or 72 hours before immunization. Protection against febrile response to challenge with 10(3) median fever doses of C. burnetii was seen in animals irradiated with 175 R, 24 or 72 hours before immunization. Significant protection was detectable at 14, 21, and 42 days after immunization in both irradiated and nonirradiated animals. Acute irradiation of the degree studied increases the mortality in normal animals infected 15 to 17 days later with virulent C. burnetii.

In this study, radiation-induced kidney injury represented by changes of creatinine clearance (Ccr) and renal parenchymal volume measured by computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by analysing dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PGDLBCL) treated with chemoradiotherapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight PGDLBCL patients (seventy-six kidneys) treated with chemoradiotherapy were included in this study. At least 4 years of follow-up was required for eligibility. Patients underwent (immuno-) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with approximately 40Gy to the whole stomach and perigastric lymph nodes. Ccr and CT were obtained at least annually. Changes of Ccr and renal parenchymal volume before and 4years after radiotherapy were compared using DVH parameters., RESULTS: Mean Ccr decreased significantly from 82.7mL/min (range, 39-124mL/min) before radiotherapy to 70.4mL/min (range, 35-109mL/min) (p=0.01) 4years after radiotherapy. Mean reduction of bilateral renal parenchymal volume was 12% (range, -5-37%) in the same time period. Ccr and renal parenchymal volume tended to lower over time more than 4years after radiotherapy. Concerning DVH analysis, V20Gy26.6% and D30%19Gy had a significant risk of bilateral renal atrophy of 14% and reduction of the Ccr20mL/min., CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a definite relationship between DVH, renal atrophy and Ccr reduction. V20Gy<26.6% and D30%<19Gy appeared to be safe dose constraints for a Ccr reduction of <20mL/min 4years after radiotherapy. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3435,"Effects of M-current modulators on the excitability of immature rat spinal sensory and motor neurones M-currents have been shown to control neuronal excitability in a variety of central and peripheral neurones. Here we studied the effects of specific M-current modulators on the excitability of spinal neurones and their response to synaptic activation. Experiments were performed in vitro using the hemisected spinal cord from 7- to 11-day-old rats. Intracellular recordings were obtained from lumbar deep dorsal horn and motor neurones. Neuronal excitability was assessed by applying outward current pulses and synaptic responses were elicited by activation of a lumbar dorsal root. The M-current antagonist 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone (XE-991) and the agonist retigabine were superfused at 10 microM. Retigabine produced hyperpolarization and a large decrease in the excitability of motor (7/7) and dorsal horn neurones (11/12). The effects of retigabine were fully reversed by XE-991. XE-991 induced depolarization of most neurones tested and a large increase in the excitability of motor neurones (7/7) but only a weak increase in the excitability of a proportion of dorsal horn neurones (4/10). The effects of XE-991 were partly reversed by retigabine. Consistent with their effects on neuronal excitability, retigabine showed a general depressant effect on synaptic transmission, whereas XE-991 showed the opposite tendency to potentiate responses to dorsal root stimulation, particularly in motor neurones. The results show that retigabine can depress spinal excitability and the transmission of nociceptive information. Results also indicate a post-synaptic expression of functional M-currents in most motor neurones and a considerable proportion of deep dorsal horn neurones.",Excluded

We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-ICMT-11 in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-ICMT-11 was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 159 +/- 2.75 MBq; range, 154-161 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and radiotracer stability. In vivo (18)F activities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated. The total numbers of disintegrations in each organ normalized to injected activity (residence times) were calculated as the area under the curve of the time-activity curve, normalized to injected activities and standard values of organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were then performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1., RESULTS: Injection of (18)F-ICMT-11 was well tolerated in all subjects, with no serious tracer-related adverse events reported. The mean effective dose averaged over both men and women was estimated to be 0.025 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq (men, 0.022 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq; women, 0.027 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq). The 5 organs receiving the highest absorbed dose (mGy/MBq), averaged over both men and women, were the gallbladder wall (0.59 +/- 0.44), small intestine (0.12 +/- 0.05), upper large intestinal wall (0.08 +/- 0.07), urinary bladder wall (0.08 +/- 0.02), and liver (0.07 +/- 0.01). Elimination was both renal and via the hepatobiliary system., CONCLUSION: (18)F-ICMT-11 is a safe PET tracer with a dosimetry profile comparable to other common (18)F PET tracers.

2220,"Associations of biomechanical properties of the cornea with environmental and metabolic factors in an elderly population: The ALIENOR study PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to assess the associations of biomechanical properties of the cornea with metabolic and environmental factors in an elderly population. METHODS. The ALIENOR (Antioxydants, Lipides Essentiels, Nutrition, and Maladies OculaiRes) study is a population-based study. In 2009-2010, 624 subjects, aged 74 years or more, underwent an eye examination, including intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), and biomechanical properties of the cornea measurements using the Ocular Response Analyzer. Socio-demographic, lifestyle, and medical history data were collected using standardized questionnaires. Mean lifetime ambient ultraviolet (UV) exposure was estimated using residential history and statistics of UV radiation at each location using the Eurosun UV database. RESULTS. Mean age was 82.2 +/- 4.3 years. Mean corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), and CCT were 9.4 +/- 1.9, 9.8 +/- 1.9 mm Hg, and 551.6 +/- 36.8 mum, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, CH and CRF values were significantly lower in subjects older than 80 years (-0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.89;-0.24); P < 0.001 and -0.48; 95% CI: -0.75;-0.20; P < 0.001, respectively), in subjects having higher ambient UV exposure (-0.50; 95% CI: -0.88;-0.12; P < 0.01; and -0.46; 95% CI: -0.78;-0.13); P < 0.05, respectively), and in subjects with high plasma LDL cholesterol (CH: -0.46; 95% CI: -0.86;-0.03; P < 0.05; and CRF: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.72;-0.008; P < 0.05). Central corneal thickness was significantly higher in former smokers than in never smokers (+11.01; 95% CI: 0.48;21.55; P < 0.05) and was not significantly associated with age, ambient UV exposure, diabetes, or LDL cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS. Biomechanical properties of the cornea are modified by metabolic and lifetime environmental factors, especially UV exposure. The manner these factors may influence onset and progression of ocular diseases or IOP measurements need further investigation.Copyright © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

2439,"A randomized comparison of the transradial and transfemoral approaches for coronary artery bypass graft angiography and intervention: the RADIAL-CABG Trial (RADIAL Versus Femoral Access for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Angiography and Intervention) OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare and contrast use and radiation exposure using radial versus femoral access during cardiac catheterization of patients who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery., BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on the relative merits of radial compared with femoral access for cardiac catheterization in patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery., METHODS: Consecutive patients (N = 128) having previously undergone CABG surgery and referred for cardiac catheterization were randomized to radial or femoral access. The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat., RESULTS: Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142 +/- 39 ml vs. 171 +/- 72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9 +/- 6.8 min vs. 34.2 +/- 14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08 +/- 0.54 Gy vs. 1.29 +/- 0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3 +/- 1.0 mrem vs. 2.6 +/- 1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8 +/- 1.1 mrem vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 mrem, p = 0.01). Fewer patients underwent ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the radial group (37.5% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.28) and radial PCI procedures were less complex. The incidences of the primary and secondary endpoints was similar with femoral and radial access among PCI patients. Access crossover was higher in the radial group (17.2% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.01) and vascular access site complications were similar in both groups (3.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery, transradial diagnostic coronary angiography was associated with greater contrast use, longer procedure time, and greater access crossover and operator radiation exposure compared with transfemoral angiography.

Plans were evaluated mainly in terms of organs at risk (OARs) sparing, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) estimation and treatment efficiency., RESULTS: Compared with the 10XFFF beam, 6XFFF beam showed statistically significant lower dose to all the OARs investigated. The percentage of NTCP reduction for both lung and chest wall was about 10% in the fraction schemes of 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy, whereas only 7.4% and 2.6% was obtained in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme. For oesophagus, heart and spinal cord, the reduction was greater with the 6XFFF beam, but their absolute estimates were <10(-6)%. The mean beam-on time for 6XFFF and 10XFFF beams at 4 x 12, 3 x 18 and 1 x 34 Gy schemes were 2.2 +/- 0.2 vs 1.5 +/- 0.1, 3.3 +/- 0.9 vs 2.0 +/- 0.5 and 6.3 +/- 0.9 vs 3.5 +/- 0.4 min, respectively., CONCLUSION: The 6XFFF beam obtains better OARs sparing and lower incidence of NTCP in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer, whereas the 10XFFF beam improves the treatment efficiency. To balance the OARs sparing and intrafractional variation owing to the prolonged treatment time, the authors recommend using the 6XFFF beam in the 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy schemes but the 10XFFF beam in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study optimizes the FFF beam selection in different fraction schemes in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer.",Excluded
1941,"Neurotrophic keratitis after transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between treatment with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and development a neurotrophic keratitis due to the damage of the sensitive corneal innervation., METHODS: A study was conducted on 5 eyes of 5 patients who were treated with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and soon developed neurotrophic ulcers. Personal characteristics of the patients were collected, as well as refraction and risk factors for corneal hypoesthesia, and the parameters of the laser used in the surgery., RESULTS: It was found that the 5 patients had predisposing factors of corneal hypoesthesia prior to surgery (chronic use of topical beta blockers, surgery with corneal incisions, diabetes mellitus, or corneal dystrophies); however none had developed neurotrophic keratitis until the cyclophotocoagulation was performed. It also showed that 4 of them were highly myopic, and they all were treated with high laser parameters (with an average of 2880 mW for 3s at an average surface of 275degree), triggering neurotrophic ulcers between 10 and 35 days after surgery., CONCLUSION: Neurotrophic keratitis is a rare complication that can occur after diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, secondary to the damage of the long ciliary nerves. The emergence of this disorder can be triggered by the existence of previous risk factors, including high myopia, thus it is important to respect the recommended treatment parameters to prevent the development of this disorder.

1869,"Should hospitals protect from geopathogenic zones? The belief that geopathogenic zones exist and could cause morbidity is widespread. It is increasing even among physicians. Presently, in health care it is going to even gain an economical dimension by causing investment costs for claimed protective means and by influencing hospital planning, design and management. Therefore, this issue is no longer just a private borderline issue but has become publicly relevant. In view of the fact that relevant studies are lacking, it deserves scientific clarification. In a double-blind study this hypothesis was tested by two different approaches: First, it was investigated whether location-bound biologic effects could be identified at all. To remain independent from dowsers, an investigation area of 35 m(2) was chosen which was large enough to ensure the presence of at least one postulated adverse zone. This area was scanned in 0.5 m intervals by monitoring bioparameters such as skin resistance, reaction time and heart rate variability in 43 volunteers. Skeptics were excluded. Location-dependent changes were investigated by point-by point analysis of local data distributions and by analysing the two-dimensional spatial distributions of the measured bioparameters by cross-correlation analysis. In a second approach, 5 independent experienced dowsers were asked to locate geopathogenic zones within the area both to verify the adequate choice of the area and to correlate the pattern of dowser's scorings with the patterns of biosignal distributions. Neither of these approaches showed statistical significant differences. The investigation did not confirm the hypothesis that local geopathogenic zones existed and, hence, would need protective actions.",Excluded

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the intraoperative parameters, effectiveness and complications of patients undergoing PCNL between the endoscopic-guided prone split-leg PCNL (ePSL) and the supine PCNL by stratifying patients according to Guy's stone score (GSS)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients undergoing PCNL at two high-volume tertiary referral centers. At one center, patients underwent PCNL using the ePSL technique, while at the second center, patients underwent PCNL in supine. Patient demographics and stone characteristics, operative details, complications and effectiveness were compared between groups. The impact of obesity was also investigated., RESULTS: Of 830 subjects, a total of 449 (54%) underwent PCNL in ePSL and 381 (46%) in supine. The ePSL group had a greater mean age and body mass index. No statistical differences were found in gender, serum chemistry and Charlson comorbidity index. After stratifying patients by GSS, the differences in baseline stone burden between PSL and supine lost significance and both groups could be compared. Complications were not statistically different between both groups. Univariate analysis demonstrated that multiple tracts and lower pole access were more prevalent in supine. In addition, for GSS1-3, ePSL was correlated with reduced operative time, radiation exposure, length of hospital stay and need for secondary procedure. Multivariate analysis correlated ePSL with lower radiation exposure and need for secondary procedures (p = 0.01). In comparison to the whole trial population, the same tendencies were appreciated for obese cohort., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report focusing on the performance differences between ePSL and supine PCNL stratified by GSS. Both techniques are safe, with a low rate of complications. For GSS1-3, ePSL reduces radiation exposure and requires less need for both multiple access and secondary procedure.",Excluded
2019,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included

The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration as a function of wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0.68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0.04) but not 14 days (p = 0.75) post-repair. Conclusions. PTB provides a benefit to tendon repair at early stages in repair and is worthy of further investigation as a potential surgical adjunct for tendon repair in orthopedic surgeries. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

732,"Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Patients and Methods: Between August 2003 and December 2007, 47 patients were treated, 29 men and 18 women, with a mean age of 33.4 years (range 2167 yrs) and a mean stone size of 31.5mm (range 2446mm). All stones were located in the renal pelvis with mild to moderate hydronephrosis seen on intravenous urography. A ureteral stent was inserted cystoscopically, and saline was injected for more localization of the pelvicaliceal system (PCS), if needed. Puncture of the PCS was performed with an 18-gauge nephrostomy needle through the lower pole calyx, and all the stages, including dilatation, were performed under ultrasonography guidance. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients were stone free in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder the day after the operation. Five patients had multiple fragments that measured about 4 to 5mm, which passed in 4 weeks (total stone-free rate: 93.61%); failure occurred in two patients, and fluoroscopy was needed; two patients who had residual fragments that measured 10 and 12mm underwent shockwave lithotripsy; and in one patient, a fragment that measured 7 to 8mm migrated into the ureterit fragmented and was removed with a ureteroscope 2 days after the operation. Conclusion(s): PCNL using sonography is a good alternative to the fluoroscopic method. It is performed without radiation exposure to the surgeon and patient; however, more experience is needed.

3279,"Corneal Nerve and Epithelial Cell Alterations in Corneal Allodynia: An In Vivo Confocal Microscopy Case Series Purpose To investigate morphological changes of the corneal epithelium and subbasal nerves in patients with corneal allodynia using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Design Case-control study of patients with corneal allodynia and healthy controls. Methods Ten eyes of six patients were diagnosed with corneal allodynia at a single center and compared to fifteen healthy eyes. IVCM of the central cornea was performed on all subjects and controls. Images were retrospectively analyzed numbers of total corneal subbasal nerves, main trunks and branches, total nerve length and density, nerve branching, and tortuosity, superficial and basal epithelial cell densities, and superficial epithelial cell size. Results Corneal allodynia was seen in patients with dry eye disease, recurrent corneal erosion syndrome, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and Accutane use. Compared to controls, patients with corneal allodynia had a significant decrease in the total numbers of subbasal nerves (P=.014), nerve branches (P=.006), total nerve length (P=.0029), total nerve density (P=.0029) and superficial and basal epithelial cell densities (P=.0004, P=.0036) with an increase in superficial epithelial cell size (P=.016). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of subbasal nerve main trunks (P=.09), nerve branching (P=.21), and nerve tortuosity (P=.05). Conclusions Corneal IVCM enables near-histological visualization and quantification of the cellular and neural changes in corneal allodynia. Regardless of etiology, corneal allodynia is associated with decreased corneal epithelial cell densities, increased epithelial cell size, and decreased numbers and lengths of subbasal nerves despite an unremarkable slit-lamp examination. Therefore, IVCM may be useful in the management of patients with corneal allodynia.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3357,"Definitive high-dose photon/proton radiotherapy for unresected mobile spine and sacral chordomas Study Design.: A retrospective review. Objective.: The purpose of this study is to report the results of high-dose proton based definitive radiotherapy for unresected spinal chordomas. Summary of Background Data.: Spine chordoma is treated primarily by surgical resection. However, local recurrence rate is high. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves local control. In certain locations, such as high sacrum, resection may result in significant neurological dysfunction. Methods.: We retrospectively reviewed 24 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated spinal chordomas (core biopsy only; no prior incision or resection) treated with high-dose definitive radiotherapy alone using protons and photons at our center from 1988 to 2009. Results.: Reasons for radiotherapy alone included medical inoperability (3) and concern for neurological dysfunction based on spine level (21). Median age was 69.5 years. Tumor locations included cervical (2), thoracic (1), lumbar (2), S1-S2 (17), and S3 or below (2). Median maximal tumor diameter was 6.6 cm (1.4-25.5), and median tumor volume was 198.3 cm (4.65-2061). Median total dose was 77.4 GyRBE (proton dose unit, gray relative biological effectiveness). Analysis at median follow-up of 56 months showed overall survival of 91.7% and 78.1%, chordoma specific survival of 95.7% and 81.5%, local progression free survival of 90.4% and 79.8% and metastases free survival of 86.5% and 76.3%, at 3 and 5 years respectively. Tumor volume more than 500 cm was correlated with worse overall survival. Long-term side effects included 8 sacral insufficiency fractures (none required surgical stabilization), 1 secondary malignancy, 1 foot drop, 1 erectile dysfunction, 1 perineal numbness, 2 worsening urinary/fecal incontinence, and 4 grade-2 rectal bleeding. None required new colostomy. All surviving patients remained ambulatory. Conclusion.: These results support the use of high-dose definitive radiotherapy for patients with medically inoperable or otherwise unresected, mobile spine or sacrococcygeal chordomas.

1839,"Population Testing of a muscular strength research device MARES (Muscular Atrophy Research and Exercise System) is a system for neuro muscular research. This system is an ergometer to be flown and installed in the International Space Station in the year 2004. The system consists of a control electronics that controls a motor, to which a subject is connected by means of a restraining system named HRS (Human Restraint System). This ergometer can be used for 11 movements (wrist flexion/extension, wrist pronation/supination, and wrist radial/ulnar deviation; trunk flexion/extension; arm pull/press, leg pull/press; elbow flexion/extension; Shoulder flexion/extension; hip flexion/extension; knee flexion/extension; and ankle dorsal/plantar flexion). The HRS must meet the following anthropometric range: from 5 percentile Japanese female to 95 percentile American male. The complete MARES system follow the verification of the specifications set at the start of the project. As part of this verification, it was necessary to perform what we have called a ""Population Testing"", that is a test verifying those specifications where the interaction with a human being is unavoidable to check the compliance: Anthropometric range Supported movements Nominal position Impairment Body position reproducibility Electrodes compatibility Joint alignment stability Comfort These verification tests included a population sample of six people per movement covering from 5 percentile Japanese female to 95 percentile American. Tests referring to the design of the HRS were described in a previous SAE paper. The results of these tests on the electrode compatibility, joint alignment stability and comfort are presented and discussed for three movements: wrist prono/supination, trunk flexion/extension and ankle dorsi/plantarflexion.

912,"Radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma Background. To evaluate the treatment outcome of radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. Methods. Between 1996 and 2001, ten patients with isolated nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy received radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The site of recurrence was the mediastinum in five patients, the celiac node in four patients, and the supraclavicular fossa in one patient. All sites of nodal recurrence were outside the previous irradiated area and without local recurrence or distant metastases. Radiotherapy was given with three-dimensional conformal technique, and an average total dose was 60 Gy. Eight patients received chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU. Results. The control rate of the irradiated region was eight of ten patients. The size of all controlled lesions was 3 cm or less in diameter. In five patients, distant metastases developed to other organs and caused death. Two patients survived without disease for 5 years and three patients survived 2 years or more. In four patients with an interval of 2 years or longer between the previous treatment and nodal recurrence, three patients survived without disease. Improvement of clinical symptoms such as dysphagia or hoarseness was obtained in five of six patients. Conclusions. Radiotherapy for isolated nodal recurrence of esophageal carcinoma after definitive chemoradiotherapy is suggested to be safe and effective. This treatment is promising as well as palliative. © Japan Esophageal Society and Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded
1026,"Transverse depth-dependent changes in corneal collagen lamellar orientation and distribution It is thought that corneal surface topography may be stabilized by the angular orientation of out-of plane lamellae that insert into the anterior limiting membrane. In this study, micro-focus X-ray scattering data were used to obtain quantitative information about lamellar inclination (with respect to the corneal surface) and the X-ray scatter intensity throughout the depth of the cornea from the centre to the temporal limbus. The average collagen inclination remained predominantly parallel to the tissue surface at all depths. However, in the central cornea, the spread of inclination angles was greatest in the anterior-most stroma (reflecting the increased lamellar interweaving in this region), and decreased with tissue depth; in the peripheral cornea inclination angles showed less variation throughout the tissue thickness. Inclination angles in the deeper stroma were generally higher in the peripheral cornea, suggesting the presence of more interweaving in the posterior stroma away from the central cornea. An increase in collagen X-ray scatter was identified in a region extending from the sclera anteriorly until about 2 mm from the corneal centre. This could arise from the presence of larger diameter fibrils, probably of scleral origin, which are known to exist in this region. Incorporation of this quantitative information into finite-element models will further improve the accuracy with which they can predict the biomechanical response of the cornea to pathology and refractive procedures.",Excluded
1008,"Irradiated homologous rib grafts in nasal reconstruction OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy of irradiated homologous rib grafts (IHRGs) for both augmentation and support function in rhinoplasty in general and for specific recipient sites within the nose. DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted at an academic medical center to evaluate the loss of volume and support function of IHRGs in 9 specific recipient sites in the nose. RESULT(S): We studied 66 patients, with a total of 177 IHRGs, dating back 9 years, with an average follow-up of 51 months. The rate of resorption increased with duration of follow-up. Complete resorption was found in 1 IHRG, and moderate resorption was observed in 55 IHRGs (31%). Resorption was characterized by a loss of support function rather than a loss of volume. Moderate resorption had a negative clinical outcome for shield grafts only. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated homologous rib grafts were safe to use in rhinoplasty. In cases requiring a shield graft, IHRGs should be avoided.",Excluded
2823,"Low-dose multidetector-row CT-angiography of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of reducing radiation dose exposure while maintaining image quality using multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) with high-concentration contrast media in patients undergoing follow-up after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single center, intra-individual study, patients underwent two consecutive MDCTA scans 6 months apart, one with a standard acquisition protocol (130 mAs/120 kV) and 120 mL of iomeprol 300, and one using a low dose protocol (100 mAs/80 kV) and 90 mL of iomeprol 400. Images acquired during the arterial phase of contrast enhancement were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for image noise and intraluminal contrast enhancement., RESULTS: Thirty adult patients were prospectively enrolled. Statistically significantly higher attenuation values were measured in the low-dose acquisition protocol compared to the standard protocol, from the suprarenal abdominal aorta to the common femoral artery (p<0.0001; all vascular segments). Qualitatively, image quality was judged significantly (p=0.0002) better with the standard protocol than with the low-dose protocol. However, no significant differences were found between the two protocols in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (13.63+/-6.97 vs. 11.48+/-8.13; p=0.1058). An overall dose reduction of up to 74% was observed for the low-dose protocol compared with the standard protocol., CONCLUSION: In repeat follow-up examinations of patients undergoing EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm, a low-dose radiation exposure acquisition protocol provides substantially reduced radiation exposure while maintaining a constant CNR and good image quality.

321,"Longstanding symptomatic choroidal hemangioma managed with limited PDT as initial or salvage therapy Purpose: To describe the use of limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of symptomatic choroidal hemangiomas. Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma were treated with limited PDT 6 min following a 1-min infusion with verteporfin (6 mg/m2 body surface area), using a diode laser (692 nm) and a single spot large enough to cover only the most prominent part of the tumor. Exposure time was 166 s in the first three patients and 83 s in the last ten patients, resulting in a radiance exposure of respectively 100 and 50 J/cm2. Result(s): In all 11 not previously conventionally treated patients, visual acuity improved following PDT treatment. The two remaining patients with prior radiation treatment both reported widening of the visual field and sharper vision, but did not show an increase in ETDRS vision. In all but four patients the tumor became ultrasonographically undetectable by the first follow-up visit at 6 weeks, with only a slight irregularity at the level of the previous tumor remaining. In four patients the residual tumor was still detectable, and they received a second treatment, following which the tumor flattened completely. In all patients the retinal detachment disappeared. Conclusion(s): The present series demonstrates that even limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is an effective first-line treatment for choroidal hemangiomas.",Excluded
2445,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded
3354,"Establishment of diagnostic reference levels in cardiac computed tomography The aim of this study was to determine diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for cardiac computed tomography (CCT) in Jordan. Volume computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol ) and dose-length product (DLP) were collected from 228 CCTs performed at seven Jordanian hospitals specialized in cardiac CT. DRLs for cardiac CT were defined at the 75th percentile of CTDIvol and DLP. CTDIvol and DLP were collected from 30 successive cardiac CT in each center except for one center (18 scans). The 75th percentile of the CTDIvol and the DLP of the centers calculated from mixed retrospective and prospective gated modes were 47.74 milligray (mGy) and 1035 mGy/cm, respectively. This study demonstrated wide dose variations among the surveyed hospitals for cardiac CT scans; there was a 5.1-fold difference between the highest and lowest median DLP with a range of 223.2-1146.7 mGy/cm. Differences were associated with variations in the mAs and kVp. This study confirmed large variability in CTDIvol and DLP for cardiac CT scans; variation was associated with acquisition protocols and highlights the need for dose optimization. DRLs are proposed for CCT; there remains substantial potential for optimization of cardiac CT examinations for adults in Jordan.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

2091,"Totally automatic definition of renal regions of interest from 99mTc-MAG3 renograms: validation in patients with normal kidneys and in patients with suspected renal obstruction INTRODUCTION: An image-processing algorithm (AUTOROI) has been developed to totally automatically (or with manual assistance) detect whole-kidney contours and generate renal regions of interest (ROI) for the extraction of the quantitative measurements used in the interpretation of Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-MAG3) renograms., METHODS: The 18-20th min dynamic frames post-MAG3 injection were used to automatically define boxes surrounding each kidney, which were then transposed to an early composite image for interpolative and directional background subtraction. Sobel operator and unsharp masking were applied for edge enhancement, and the resulting image histograms were equalized to better define poorly functioning kidneys. AUTOROI searched radially from the center of mass to define each kidney's ROI coordinates. AUTOROI was validated using MAG3 studies from 79 patients referred for suspected obstruction (79 left, 77 right kidneys) and 19 kidney donors with normal kidney function and no obstruction. Renal ROIs were manually defined by a nuclear medicine technologist with 20+ years of experience (reference standard) and an American Board of Nuclear Medicine certified physician. AUTOROI and physician ROIs were automatically compared with the reference standard to determine the border definition error., RESULTS: AUTOROI totally automatically detected the renal borders in 89% (172 of 194) of the kidneys from the entire group of 98 patients. The 22 kidneys missed automatically were subsequently detected with the assistance of a single manually placed fiducial point demarcating the liver/kidney boundary. These 22 kidneys were shown to be associated with markedly reduced MAG3 clearance. The mean error of AUTOROI for all 194 kidneys was 6.66+/-3.77 and 7.31+/-4.52 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. The physician's error was 6.78+/-2.42 and 6.65+/-2.05 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. This error difference between AUTOROI and the physician was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: AUTOROI provides an objective and promising approach to automated renal ROI detection.",Excluded
1611,"Treatment of bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions with beta radiation using strontium 90 and sequential positioning pullback technique: procedural details and clinical outcomes BACKGROUND: In-stent restenotic lesions have been problematic for many patients with the need for multiple repeat percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The need for repeat PCI has been significantly reduced in patients since the advent of vascular brachytherapy. In-stent restenosis resulting in bifurcation presents even more of a challenge. The use of radiation therapy for the treatment of this kind of lesion has not yet been reported. The purpose of this paper is to present five cases of radiation therapy in bifurcation in-stent restenotic lesions using the intraluminal beta radiation catheter delivery system (Beta-Cath System, Novoste Corporation, Norcross, Georgia)., METHODS: We reviewed the database of patients enrolled in our Compassionate Use Registry between August 1999 and April 2002. The data is reported for 5 patients who received radiation in both branches of bifurcation lesions with the Beta-Cath catheter system., RESULTS: The mean diameter of the vessels was 3.1 mm 0.5 mm. The dose administered was from 18.3 to 23 Gy, with an overlap of 3.3 to 10.3 mm; the hinge angle between the branches went from 43.3 to 65.4 . Angiographic follow-up was obtained at 6 months in 4 patients, with a single patient showing a focal (< 5 mm) edge lesion treated by balloon angioplasty (TVR no TLR). No aneurysms or zones of ectasia were noted., CONCLUSION: Beta radiation with the Beta-Cath catheter system appears to be safe, secure and clinically useful in in-stent restenotic bifurcation lesions.",Excluded

Method(s): A retrospective chart review was performed. Result(s): Between March 2006 and December 2013, 122 consecutive patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were treated by surgery followed by postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy. In regard to the site of the primary tumor, 59 (48%) patients had cancer of the oral cavity, 31 (26%) patients had cancer of the hypopharynx, 14 (11%) patients had cancer of the oropharynx, 10 (8%) patients had cancer of the larynx and 8 (7%) patients had cancer of unknown primary. The median follow-up period of the surviving patients was 54 months (range, 25-115). Concurrent chemotherapy was administered in 76 patients (62%). The median prescribed radiation dose was 66 Gy. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, distant metastasis free survival and loco-regional control rates were 59%, 48%, 52.4% and 71%, respectively. Of the 122 patients, 32 developed loco-regional recurrence as the initial recurrence, including in-field recurrence in 26 patients, marginal recurrence in five patients and out-field recurrence in seven patients. Of the five patients with marginal recurrence, four have had two or more surgeries before the intensity-modulated radiotherapy and three had oral cavity cancer. Severe adverse events were not frequent, occurring at a frequency of <5%, except for mucositis. No severe toxicities associated with the flap reconstruction were observed either.

Material(s) and Method(s): Between July 1996 and June 2010, 104 patients underwent surgery for rectal cancer after preoperative CRT. The median dose of radiotherapy was 50.4 Gy (range, 43.2 to 54.4 Gy) for 6 weeks. Chemotherapy was a bolus injection of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin for the first and last week of radiotherapy (n=84, 77.1%) or capecitabine administered daily during radiotherapy (n=17, 16.3%). Low anterior resection (n=86, 82.7%) or abdominoperineal resection (n=18, 17.3%) was performed at a median 47 days from the end of radiotherapy, and four cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was checked at initial diagnosis and just before surgery. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 9 to 174 months), 5-year disease free survival (DFS) was 74.5% and 5-year overall survival (OS) was 86.4%. Down staging of T diagnoses occurred in 32 patients (30.8%) and of N diagnoses in 40 patients (38.5%). The CEA change from initial diagnosis to pre-surgery (high-high vs. highnormal vs. normal-normal) was a statistically significant prognostic factor for DFS (p=0.012), OS (p=0.002), and distant metastasis free survival (p=0.018) in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion(s): Patients who achieve normal CEA level by the time of surgery have a more favorable outcome than those who retain a high CEA level after preoperative CRT.

Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",Included
3099,"A Prospective Study of Distal Microscopic Spread in Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Pinned and Unpinned Specimen The most important margin in determining the prognosis of rectal cancer is circumferential resection margin (CRM). But, the type of surgery is determined by distal rectal margin (DRM), whether sphincter saving procedure is possible or patient needs an abdominoperineal resection. There are no standardized uniform guidelines for measurement of DRM. The purpose of this study is to assess the distal microscopic spread beyond gross margin after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) in rectal cancers, the factors influencing the distal microscopic spread, the shrinkage of the distal margin in pinned and unpinned fresh and fixed specimen, and to find out the best method of measurement of distal rectal margin. A prospective analytical study was conducted from May 2013 through February 2015 in 47 cases of carcinoma rectum (both AR and APR) who had received neoadjuvant CCRT. Fresh specimen was collected within 30 min of specimen retrieval and a longitudinal cut was made in the distal margin of all specimens. One side of the specimen was pinned onto a cork board and the other side was left unpinned. Measurements were made from the distal end of clinical gross tumor. DRM was determined in both pinned and unpinned sides in fresh and fixed specimen. Of the 47 patients, 2 patients (4.2%) had small focus of tumor beyond gross margins, 1 at 6 mm and another at 3.5 mm on the unpinned side. The average margin for fresh and fixed pinned specimens was 3.67 and 3.47 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 5.4% for the pinned specimens. The average margin for fresh and fixed unpinned specimens was 3.32 and 2.84 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 14.4% for the unpinned specimens. Six patients (12.7%) had complete pathological response. Correlation of distal margin was better in pinned specimen. A correction factor of 15% for shrinkage needs to be taken into account while assessing unpinned specimen. Only in 4.2% of patients, there was distal submucosal spread beyond gross margin. Long-term follow up is required for assessing adequacy of DRM post neoadjuvant CCRT.Copyright © 2017, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
2664,"Rationale use of unenhanced multi-detector CT (CT KUB) in evaluation of suspected renal colic Objective: To assess the yield of non-contrast enhanced CT (CT KUB) across different ordering specialties and need of developing an algorithm for its rationale use. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 1550 consecutive CT KUB studies requested for suspected renal colic carried out at a single institution in a calendar year. The data was analyzed for demographic characteristics, referring clinician and final diagnosis. Only patients with CT as primary imaging for clinically suspected reno-ureteral colic were included. Departments ordering these CT KUB examinations were divided into three divisions: Urologist, emergency room (ER) physician and others. Result(s): Of 1550 CT KUB performed in the study period 766 met the inclusion criteria. Urologists (57%), followed by ER physicians (30%) mostly ordered the examination. The overall positive yield for urolithiasis was 64% (n = 490), rate of incidental/alternate findings was 15% (n = 116) and 21% (n = 160) were negative. Urologist has the highest positive yield of 67.4% (n = 295) followed by ER physician 67% (n = 152) and others 42.5% (n = 43); p < 0.001.

Result(s): We identified a total of 5,991,314 hospitalizations with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal malignancies and RT (~73 yrs., 85.2% female), of which 7663 (0.13%, 128 per 100,000) were diagnosed with TTS (~74 yrs., 95.8% females, 88.1% white). Higher odds and rising trends in TTS per 100,000 hospitalizations (from 31 to 241) were seen among patients with prior intrathoracic malignancies and RT as compared to those without (from 19 to 104) (ptrend < 0.001). All-cause in-hospital mortality (4.6% vs 2.8%; OR 1.45; 95%CI 1.29-1.63, p < 0.001), cardiogenic shock (4.3% vs 0.2%), cardiac arrest (3.1% vs 0.9%), arrhythmia (34.3% vs 24.6%), stroke (3.6% vs 2.8%), respiratory failure (14.5% vs 4.6%), and median length of stay and hospital charges were significantly higher in the TTS cohort. Conclusion(s): This study showed higher odds and increasing trends in TTS-related admissions with worse in-hospital outcomes among patients with prior intrathoracic/mediastinal cancer and RT, irrespective of the time interval from cancer diagnosis or RT to TTS occurrence.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2862,"A comparison of direct versus conventional stenting in patients undergoing primary angioplasty for ST-elevation myocardial infarction OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the impact of direct stenting (DS) on procedural success and the in-hospital outcome among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., BACKGROUND: With improvements in stent designs, DS has become more widespread. The theoretical advantages of DS include a shorter procedural time, a lower contrast dose, and reduced spiral dissections, along with reduced radiation exposure and procedural costs., METHODS: A total of 1992 consecutive STEMI patients were reviewed; 621 patients (31.2%) were included in the DS group and 1371 (68.8%) in the conventional stenting (CS) group. The clinical and angiographic characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and predictors of unsuccessful primary angioplasty were analyzed., RESULTS: The incidence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 6.1% in the CS group and 4.3% in the DS group. The difference between the two patient groups was not statistically significant for myocardial reinfarction (re-MI), target-vessel revascularization, and MACE. Nonetheless, the rates of in-hospital mortality and advanced heart failure were significantly lower in the DS group. CS [odds ratio (OR) 3.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.65-7.37, P=0.001], Killip class 2/3 (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.23, P=0.01), glomerular filtration rateless than 60 ml/min/1.73 m (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.22-3.94, P=0.008), and anterior MI (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.01-2.56, P=0.04) were found to be independent predictors of unsuccessful procedures., CONCLUSION: DS improves the in-hospital outcomes of STEMI patients treated with primary PCI, particularly by reducing the rates of in-hospital mortality and advanced heart failure. CS was an independent predictor of unsuccessful PCI.",Excluded
330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded
1192,"Ischaemic heart disease incidence and mortality in an extended cohort of Mayak workers first employed in 1948-1982 Objective: Incidence and mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was studied in an extended cohort of 22,377 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association during 1948-82 and followed up to the end of 2008. Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"". Result(s): A significant increasing linear trend in IHD incidence with total dose from external g-rays was observed after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from internal radiation {ERR/Gy50.10 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.17]}. The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)]. Statistically significant dose effect was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed to internal alpha radiation at dose to the liver ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy50.44 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.85)]. Conclusion(s): This study provides strong evidence of IHD incidence and mortality association with external g-ray exposure and some evidence of IHDincidence andmortality association with internal alpha-radiation exposure. Advances in knowledge: It is the first time the validity of internal radiation dose estimates has been shown to affect the risk of IHD incidence.Copyright © The Authors Publised by the British Institute of Radiology.",Included
1362,"Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.",Excluded
18,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE. RESULT(S):Male/Female (8/8). Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
1680,"The association of residential altitude on the molecular profile and survival of melanoma: Results of an interreg study Cutaneous melanoma (CM) incidence is rising worldwide and is the primary cause of death from skin disease in the Western world. Personal risk factors linked to environmental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are well-known etiological factors contributing to its development. Nevertheless, UVR can contribute to the development of CM in different patterns and to varying degrees. The present study aimed at investigating whether altitude of residence can contribute to the development of specific types of CM and/or influence its progression. To this aim, 306 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from primary CM diagnosed in different geographical areas were submitted to B-RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and N-RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (NRAS) mutational status detection and mRNA and miRNA profiling by qPCR. Genes were chosen for their functions in specific processes, such as immune response (CD2, PDL1, or CD274) and pigmentation (MITF, TYRP1, and TRPM1). Furthermore, four microRNAs, namely miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-204-5p, and miR-211-5p, were included in the profiling. Our results highlight differences in the gene expression profile of primary CM with respect to the geographical area and the altitude of residence. Melanoma-specific survival was influenced by the gene expression of mRNA and miRNAs and varied with the altitude of patients' residence. In detail, TYRP1 and miR-204-5p were highly expressed in patients living at higher altitudes, unlike miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-211-5p. Since miRNAs are highly regulated by reactive oxygen species, it is possible that different regulatory mechanisms characterize CMs at different altitudes due to the different environment and UVR intensity.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

381,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded

2781,"Ultrasound Guidance Reduces Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Cost Compared to Fluoroscopy OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost factors associated with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and to determine which method can be performed at a lower cost per case., METHODS: A cost comparison study was performed utilizing clinical data from a prospectively maintained research database. We included the most recent 33 consecutive ultrasound-guided PCNL cases in 2016 and the most recent 40 consecutive fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases before the operative surgeon transitioned to ultrasound guidance in May 2014. The total operative time and clinical outcomes were examined. Costs were extracted from the institution accounting systems and given a uniform multiplier to protect institutional financial reporting confidentiality. Comparisons were made using the Student t test and the chi-squared test., RESULTS: After excluding outliers, 71 PCNL procedures were included in the analysis. Demographic data and stone characteristics were not different between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided groups. However, the mean operative time for ultrasound-guided PCNL was significantly shorter (99.8 +/- 27.0 vs 144.9 +/- 55.1 minutes, P < .05). When capital equipment costs were included, the mean total cost per case of ultrasound-guided PCNL was approximately 30% less than fluoroscopy-guided PCNL (simulated costs with a uniform multiplier; $5258.90 +/- 957.12 vs $7508.60 +/- 1163.83, P < .05). Postoperative clinical outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: When capital costs are included, ultrasound-guided PCNL can produce comparable clinical outcomes to fluoroscopy-guided procedures at a lower cost to the institution. Shorter operative time drives significant savings with the adoption of ultrasound guidance, which may be magnified with increasing case volume. Using ultrasound imaging during PCNL may be more cost-effective compared to fluoroscopy and warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
675,"Modalities of surveillance in treated nasopharyngeal cancer OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of different modalities in the detection of disease during the early posttreatment period of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We prospectively evaluated 57 patients with NPC who were treated with radiation. A postnasal space (PNS) biopsy, an endoscopic examination, and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 4 months after treatment. RESULT(S): Four patients had evidence of disease in the PNS biopsy specimen. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the endoscopic examination were 75%, 94.3%, 50%, and 98%, respectively, while those of the CT scan were 50%, 49.1%, 6.9%, and 92.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In the early postradiation period for patients with NPC, an endoscopic examination is a suitable surveillance modality, but routine CT scanning has no added clinical benefit. SIGNIFICANCE: When an endoscopic examination of the PNS yields normal results, a biopsy is not necessary because the likelihood of disease is low.",Excluded
2877,"Finger joint cartilage evaluated by ultrasound and X-ray in rheumatoid arthritis and control joints Background: Joint destruction in RA includes both bone and cartilage lesions. By X-ray examination, cartilage destruction is evaluated as a joint space narrowing (JSN). However, joint space narrowing is not a direct evaluation of cartilage. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the finger joint cartilage by ultrasound (US) imaging and to compare it with JSN score in relation to clinical relevance. Method(s): We enrolled 27 RA patients in low disease activity or clinical remission (DAS28-CRP <2.7) and 21 healthy controls in this study. The cartilage thickness (CT) of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of 2nd to 5th fingers was bilaterally visualized and measured from a dorsal view, with approximately 90 degrees flexion. In addition, JSN of finger were scored by van der Heijde- modified Sharp method. Result(s): In patients with RA, CT in MCP joints ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 mm (median 0.4 mm), and CT in PIP ranged from 0.0 to 0.4mm (median 0.2mm), respectively. The sum of total CT from 8 fingers ranged from 2.7 to 6.8 mm (median 4.7 mm), and there was a significant difference in CT, but not in JSN score, between male and female patients (5.6 versus 4.6, respectively, p=0.005). Healthy controls had the sum of total CT significantly thicker as compared with RA (p<=0.001). Importantly, CT was well correlated with JSN (r=-0.696, p<0.001). Although CT was not correlated with age, disease duration, DAS28-CRP, functional disability score, positivity of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP-antibody, CT was reduced in RA patients with elevated serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) values compared with those with normal MMP-3 (3.9 versus 5.0, p=0.015). Conclusion(s): The US method of direct visualization and quantification of cartilage in MCP and PIP joints can be valid and useful in RA, and our results may support the importance of MMP-3 in the pathophysiology of cartilage destruction.",Excluded

We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu.

Analyses of variance with Bonferroni correction were used to compare standard and low-dose protocols in terms of patient demographics, physician experience, target lesion size, total dose-length product, total acquisitions, size-specific dose estimate, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion conspicuity ratings. All procedures were performed on the same 16-slice CT scanner., RESULTS: Voluntary protocol adherence was 100% (lung) and 89% (extrapulmonary). The low-dose protocol achieved significantly lower total average dose-length product [(lung) 735.6 +/- 599.4 mGy x cm to 252.1 +/- 101.9 mGy x cm, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 724.7 +/- 545.0 mGy x cm to 392.9 +/- 239.5 mGy x cm, P < .001] and size-specific dose estimate [(lung) 5.2 +/- 0.8 mGy x cm to 4.3 +/- 1.5 mGy, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 10.1 +/- 6.7 mGy to 6.5 +/- 2.7 mGy, P < .001]. Only the change in protocol was independently associated with lower size-specific dose estimates when controlling for the other variables (P < .0001). This was achieved with no significant differences in signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, or lesion conspicuity., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a low-dose protocol for CT-guided biopsies resulted in 21% and 36% of size-specific dose estimate reduction for lung and extrapulmonary biopsies, respectively, with excellent adherence. Interventional and body radiologists should implement low dose CT-guidance protocols aiming to improve patient safety. Copyright © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2016 and October 2019, 454 consecutive patients with 501 SPNs who received CT-guided microcoil localization before VATS in our institution were enrolled. The diameter of the nodules was 0.93 +/- 0.49 cm, and the shortest distance from the nodules to the pleura was 1.41 +/- 0.95 cm. The distal end of the microcoil was placed less than 1 cm away from the nodule, and the proximal end was placed outside the visceral pleura. VATS was performed under the guidance of implanted microcoils without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy. RESULT(S): All 501 nodules were marked with microcoils. The time required for microcoil localization was 12.8 +/- 5.2 minutes. Microcoil localization-related complications occurred in 179 cases (39.4%). None of the complications required treatment. A total of 463 nodules were successfully resected under the guidance of implanted microcoils. VATS revealed 38 patients with dislocated microcoils, of which 28 underwent wedge resection (21 cases under the guidance of the bleeding points of pleural puncture, 7 cases through palpation), 5 underwent direct lobectomy, and the remaining 5 underwent a conversion to thoracotomy. In 4 cases, a portion of the microcoil remained in the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION(S): CT-guided microcoil localization of SPNs is safe and reliable. Marking the nodule and pleura simultaneously with microcoils can effectively guide the resection of SPNs using VATS without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2922,"Treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with image-guided high-dose rate, interstitial brachytherapy as second-line or salvage therapy PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of image-guided high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy (iBT) for the treatment of patients with hepatic, lymphatic, and pancreatic metastases originating from gastric cancer, an entity rarely surgically treatable with curative intent. METHODS Twelve patients with a cumulative number of 36 metastases (29 liver, 2 pancreatic, 5 lymph node) from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma received iBT between 2010 and 2016 and were retrospectively analyzed. Every patient underwent palliative chemotherapy prior to iBT. The iBT procedure employs a temporarily, intratumorally placed iridium-192 source in a single fraction with the goal of tumor cell eradication. Effectiveness was assessed clinically and by radiologic imaging every three months. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 32 of all treated metastases (89%). Four lesions showed a local recurrence after 7 months. Lesion sizes varied from 9 to 102 mm with a median of 20 mm. The median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range, 1.8-46.8 months). The median overall survival was 11.4 months (range, 5-47 months). One patient suffered a major complication following iBT, hepatic hematoma and abscess (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3), successfully dealt with by transcutaneous drainage. CONCLUSION iBT is an overall safe procedure, which facilitates high rates of local tumor control in treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. Compared with surgical metastasectomy, similar overall survival rates could be achieved in our patient collective after iBT application.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded
3006,"Impact of PET/CT on Staging and Treatment of Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Objective: To understand the effects of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) evaluation on patients with previously untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with clinical evidence of regional lymph node involvement. Study Design: Prospective blinded study. Setting(s): Tertiary care cancer center. Subjects and Methods: Informed consent was obtained and data collected from 52 consecutive previously untreated patients with HNSCC and clinical evidence of cervical metastasis. All patients underwent conventional evaluation for HNSCC and whole body PET/CT. Data were evaluated by 5 independent reviewers, who performed TNM staging per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (seventh edition) manual and proposed a treatment plan prior to viewing, and after reviewing, PET/CT. Cases where at least 3 of 5 reviewers agreed were considered significant. Result(s): There were 0 patients for whom review of the PET/CT altered the T-class assessment (95% CI, 0-6.8), 12 (23.1%) for whom PET/CT altered N classification (95% CI, 12.5-34.5), and 2 (3.8%) for whom PET/CT altered the M classification (95% CI, 0.5-13.2). For 5 patients (9.6%), overall stage was altered per PET/CT review (95% CI, 3.2-21). For 3 patients (5.8%), PET/CT findings prompted reviewers to alter treatment recommendations (95% CI, 1.2-15.9). Conclusion(s): When added to more conventional patient evaluation, PET/CT results in changes to the TNM categories, but overall staging and treatment were less frequently affected. Whether PET/CT should be used routinely for patients with stage III and IV HNSCC is still subjective and merits further study.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2018.",Excluded
2739,"Surgery Followed by Hypofractionated Radiosurgery on the Tumor Bed in Oligometastatic Patients With Large Brain Metastases. Results of a Phase 2 Study PURPOSE: This prospective phase II study assessed safety and feasibility of surgery followed by hypofractionated radiosurgery (HSRS) on the tumor bed in oligometastatic patients with single large brain metastases (BMs)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2015 and May 2018, 101 patients were enrolled. Oligometastatic disease was defined by a maximum of 5 extracranial metastatic lesions. HSRS was performed within 1 month of surgery and consisted of 30 Gy in 3 fractions. Local control, occurrence of new BMs, overall survival, and treatment-related toxicities were assessed., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 26 months, local recurrence occurred in 6 patients (5.9%). Six-month, 1-year, and 2-year local control rates were 100%, 98.9% +/- 1.1%, and 85.9% +/- 0.6%, respectively. New BMs occurred in 39 patients (38.6%); median brain distant progression time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year brain distant progression rates were 39 months (95% CI, 19-39 months), 17% +/- 3.7%, 31.4% +/- 4.8%, and 42.5% +/- 5.9%, respectively. At the last observation time, 50 patients (49.5%) were alive and 51 (50.5%) were dead; 10 patients died owing to neurologic causes and 40 as a result of systemic progression. Median overall survival time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year overall survival rates were 22 months (95% CI, 20-30 months), 95% +/- 2.1%, 81.9% +/- 3.8%, and 46.6% +/- 6%, respectively. Infratentorial site, residual tumor volume, longer interval time between primary diagnosis and occurrence of BMs, and oligometastatic disease status significantly influenced outcome. Grade 2 to 3 radionecrosis occurred in 26 patients. Neurocognitive functions remained stable or, in some cases, improved., CONCLUSIONS: Surgery followed by HSRS on the tumor bed is a safe and effective approach, affording good brain control with acceptable toxicities. As for extracranial metastatic sites, patients with BMs can benefit from local ablative treatment in the context of an oligometastatic disease. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

1212,"Electronic brachytherapy for superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma: A report of two prospective pilot trials using different doses Purpose: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a very common cancer in the Caucasian population. Treatment aims to eradicate the tumor with the lowest possible functional and aesthetic impact. Electronic brachytherapy (EBT) is a treatment technique currently emerging. This study aims to show the outcomes of two consecutive prospective pilot clinical trials using different radiation doses of EBT with Esteya EB system for the treatment of superficial and nodular basal cell carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Two prospective, single-center, non-randomized, pilot studies were conducted. Twenty patients were treated in each study with different doses. The first group (1) was treated with 36.6 Gy in 6 fractions of 6.1 Gy, and the second group (2) with 42 Gy in 6 fractions of 7 Gy. Cure rate, acute toxicity, and late toxicity related to cosmesis were analyzed in the two treatment groups. Result(s): In group 1, a complete response in 90% of cases was observed at the first year of follow-up, whereas in group 2, the complete response was 95%. The differences with reference to acute toxicity and the cosmetic results between the two treatment groups were not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): Our initial experience with Esteya EB system to treat superficial and nodular BCC shows that a dose of 36.6 Gy and 42 Gy delivered in 6 fraction of 7 Gy achieves a 90% and 95% clinical cure rate at 1 year, respectively. Both groups had a tolerable toxicity and a very good cosmesis. The role of EBT in the treatment of BCC is still to be defined. It will probably become an established option for selected patients in the near future.Copyright © 2016, Termedia Publishing House Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
528,"Field response of the twig beetle, Pityophthorus pubescens, to the aggregation pheromone, (E)-(+)-pityol, is not inhibited by (E)-(-)-pityol, and evidence of monogyny Field studies were conducted to determine the flight response of the twig beetle Pityophthorus pubescens (Marsham) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) to the potential aggregation pheromone component, (E)-(+)-pityol, and its racemic form, (E)-(+/-)-pityol, in different Pinus spp. L.

Both (E)-(+)-pityol and (E)-(+/-)-pityol equally attracted more males than females, and they were all significantly different from the blank controls. Data about P. pubescens gallery systems in naturally infested P. radiata D. Don branches are also provided. The presence of one male and one female was the most common gallery habitation found in debarked twigs. Current results suggest that P. pubescens may be monogynous and females might mediate the aggregation of mating partners.",Excluded
903,"Cisplatin/capecitabine with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in anal squamous cell carcinoma: a preliminary study Objective: Mitomycin (MMC)/5-fluoroural (5-FU) with concurrent radiation is the standard treatment of anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) as an alternative with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in ASCC setting. Method(s): We retrospectively screened all patients with stage I-IV ASCC from January 2010 to June 2019. The records of patients who received definitive chemoradiation with cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) and IMRT were collected and analyzed. Result(s): The first patient was treated with XP in 2017, so totally 11 patients were included in our study from January 2017 to June 2019. All patients have experienced clinical complete response (cCR). After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 18-39 months), no patient had local recurrence or distant metastasis. Two-year colostomy-free survival (CFS) and two-year disease-free survival (DFS) were both 100%. The median overall survival (OS) has not reached. Grade 3 acute toxicities included leukopenia (1, 9.1%), neutropenia (2, 18.2%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 18.2%). No grade 4 acute adverse events occurred. Conclusion(s): In our study, cisplatin/capecitabine combined with IMRT was safe in ASCC patients, with favorable efficacy as an alternative, and is expected to be explored in study with larger sample.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
1353,"Downstream Imaging Utilization After MR Angiography Versus CT Angiography for the Initial Evaluation of Pulmonary Embolism Objective: To compare the proportion of emergency department (ED) patients who undergo subsequent chest CT or MR within 1 year of an initially negative scan for pulmonary embolism (PE). Method(s): This single-center, retrospective, observational study examined the use of chest CT or MR for ED patients with MR angiography (MRA) negative for PE during April 2008 to March 2013. We compared the 1-year scan utilization for these cases to an age- and sex-matched cohort of patients who underwent CT angiography (CTA). We also calculated time to first follow-up scan and mean radiation dose in each arm. Trained data abstractors used a standardized protocol and electronic case report form to gather all outcomes of interest. Results are reported as means or proportions with their associated confidence intervals (CIs). Result(s): In all, 717 ED patients (430 MRAs and 287 CTAs) were included. At 1 year, the proportion undergoing subsequent imaging (MRA 16.7%, CTA 15.3%; difference = 1.4%, 95% CI 4.05%-6.86%) and time to first follow-up scan (difference = 13 days, 95% CI -22.69-48.7) did not differ between arms. Mean radiation dose per patient at 1 year was significantly higher in the CTA arm (9.82 mSv; 95% CI 9.12-10.53) compared with 2.92 mSv (95% CI 1.86-3.98) with MRA. Those with an index MRA were more likely to undergo subsequent MRAs (odds ratio 3.68; 95% CI 1.22-11.12) than those with an index CTA. However, in both arms, the majority (85%) of subsequent scans were CTAs. Conclusion(s): When comparing patients initially undergoing MRA versus CTA for the evaluation of PE, there was no difference in downstream chest CT or MR use at 1 year.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology",Excluded
504,"Regulation of the metastasis of murine ocular melanoma by natural killer cells In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed. This study demonstrates the importance of the NK cell as a primary effector cell for the control of metastasis from in vivo derived ocular B16F10 melanoma.",Excluded
3426,"Radioresistant laryngeal cancers upregulate type 1 IGF receptor and exhibit increased cellular dependence on IGF and EGF signalling Objectives: Patients failing radiotherapy for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) often require salvage total laryngectomy which has major functional consequences, highlighting a need for biomarkers of radiotherapy resistance. In other tumour types, radioresistance has been linked to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1R). Here, we evaluated IGF-1R and EGFR as predictors and mediators of LSCC radioresistance. Design(s): We compared IGF-1R and EGFR immunohistochemical scores in patients with LSCC achieving long-term remission post-radiotherapy (n = 23), patients treated with primary laryngectomy (n = 22) or salvage laryngectomy following radiotherapy recurrence (n = 18). To model radioresistance in vitro, two LSCC cell lines underwent clinically relevant irradiation to 55 Gy in 2.75 Gy fractions. Result(s): Type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor expression was higher in pre-treatment biopsies of radiotherapy failures compared with those in long-term remission and was upregulated post-radiotherapy. Patients undergoing primary laryngectomy had more advanced T/N stage and greater tumour IGF-1R content than those achieving long-term remission. Pre-treatment EGFR did not associate with radiotherapy outcomes but showed a trend to upregulation post-irradiation. In vitro, radiosensitivity was enhanced by inhibition of EGFR but not IGF. Repeated irradiation upregulated IGF-1R in BICR18 and SQ20B cells and EGFR in SQ20B, and enhanced SQ20B radioresistance. Repeatedly irradiated SQ20B_55 cells were not radiosensitised by inhibition of IGF and/or EGFR, but IGF-1R:EGFR co-inhibition suppressed baseline cell survival more effectively than blockade of either pathway alone, and more effectively than in parental cells. Conclusion(s): Radiation upregulates IGF-1R and may enhance IGF/EGFR dependence, suggesting that IGF/EGFR blockade may have activity in LSCCs that recur post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded

2352,"Effect of early risedronate treatment on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation: A prospective single-center study The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of risedronate (RIS) on bone loss and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis within the first month after LT were randomized to receive RIS 35 mg/week plus calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D3 800 IU/day (n = 45) or calcium and vitamin D3 at same dosages (n = 44). Primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) 6 and 12 months after LT. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (P1NP) and fracture rate. Spine X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. There was no significant difference in BMD changes between both treatment groups at any sites; either at 6 or 12 months. Spine BMD increased in both groups at 12 months vs. baseline (P = 0.001). RIS patients had a significant increase in intertrochanteric BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Serum beta-CTX decreased in both groups (P < 0.01), with significant differences between groups at 3 months. No significant difference in vertebral fracture incidence was found. After 12 months, BMD improved at lumbar spine and did not change at hip in both groups. Significant differences between both groups were not found. Other factors (calcium and vitamin D replacement, early prednisone withdrawal) seem to have also positive effects in BMD. © 2011 The Authors Transplant International © 2011 European Society for Organ Transplantation.",Excluded
960,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded
3192,"Individual consistency in exploratory behaviour and mating tactics in male guppies While behavioural plasticity is considered an adaptation to fluctuating social and environmental conditions, many animals also display a high level of individual consistency in their behaviour over time or across contexts (generally termed 'personality'). However, studies of animal personalities that include sexual behaviour, or functionally distinct but correlated traits, are relatively scarce. In this study, we tested for individual behavioural consistency in courtship and exploratory behaviour in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in two light environments (high vs. low light intensity). Based on previous work on guppies, we predicted that males would modify their behaviour from sneak mating tactics to courtship displays under low light conditions, but also that the rank orders of courtship effort would remain unchanged (i.e. highly sexually active individuals would display relatively high levels of courtship under both light regimes). We also tested for correlations between courtship and exploratory behaviour, predicting that males that had high display rates would also be more likely to approach a novel object. Although males showed significant consistency in their exploratory and mating behaviour over time (1 week), we found no evidence that these traits constituted a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work, we found no overall effect of the light environment on any of the behaviours measured, although males responded to the treatment on an individual-level basis, as reflected by a significant individual-by-environment interaction. The future challenge is to investigate how individual consistency across different environmental contexts relates to male reproductive success. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Optimal treatment strategies for newly diagnosed localized ENKL have not been fully defined. Here we retrospectively analyzed 72 patients with newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL treated with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) regimen chemotherapy with sandwiched radiotherapy in our department between May 2012 and September 2014. After 2 cycles of GDP induction chemotherapy, the complete response rate (CRR) and overall response rate (ORR) were 30.6% (22/72) and 91.7% (66/72). After whole treatment completion, the CRR and ORR were 81.9% (59/72) and 91.7% (66/72), respectively. With a median follow-up of 57.8 months (Interquartile Range 54.0-64.5 months), the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 70.9% (95% CI, 60.1% to 81.7%), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 72.0% (95% CI, 61.6% to 82.4%), respectively. Patients with CRR after treatment had better prognosis than their counterparts. The major adverse events were myelosuppression, liver dysfunction, gemcitabine-related skin rash, and digestive tract toxicities. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 18.0% (13/72) and 15.3% (11/72), respectively. No treatment related deaths were observed. It is concluded that the GDP regimen with sandwiched radiotherapy was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL, nasal-type.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We present a retrospective study of a series of patients who are diagnosed with Dt-GCT about the ankle joint, there clinical outcome is evaluated in this study. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifteen patients with radiologically and histologically confirmed Dt-GCT about the ankle joint were identified in our foot and ankle department. Patients were managed with open synovectomy for the tumor tissue and bone grafting for bony erosions. X-rays and MRI scans were used for evaluation of the tumor and bony erosions pre- and post-operatively. Pre- and post-operative ankle function was assessed using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society -Ankle and Hindfoot (AOFAS-AH) score and the Muscularskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score. Result(s): The mean follow-up duration was 37.4 months (range 25 to 50 months). There were 6 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 35 years old (range 18 to 65 years). All patients had talar erosion with the average size of 10.1*9.1z.ast;8.2 mm, distal tibia was affected in 5 patients with the average size of 6.2 5.6 5.8 mm. 7 patients had tendon involvement, 2 patients had recurrence and progression of ankle osteoarthritis.

319,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1 Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included

(2) Methods: Bioptic and ablative procedures on bone lesions were retrospectively analyzed. All procedures were divided into SIRIO and Non-SIRIO groups and in <2 cm and >2 cm groups. Number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose were reported for each group. Diagnostic accuracy was obtained for bioptic procedures. (3) Results: One-hundred-ninety-three procedures were evaluated: 142 biopsies and 51 ablations. Seventy-four biopsy procedures were performed using SIRIO and 68 under standard CT-guidance; 27 ablative procedures were performed using SIRIO and 24 under standard CT-guidance. A statistically significant reduction in the number of CT-scans, procedural time and radiation dose was observed for percutaneous procedures performed using SIRIO, in both <2 cm and >2 cm groups. The greatest difference in all variables examined was found for procedures performed on lesions <2 cm. Higher diagnostic accuracy was found for all SIRIO-assisted biopsies. No major or minor complications occurred in any procedures.

Method(s): Patients aged > 70 years with untreated, measurable, LD-SCLC, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8, every 21 days for 4 cycles, and sequential TRT (54Gy in 27 fractions). Carboplatin doses were based on AUC of 4 and 5 (levels 1 and 2, respectively), with a fixed irinotecan dose (50 mg/m2). Primary objective of the phase II study was overall responce rate. Result(s): Forty-three patients were enrolled and forty-one were finally analyzed (median age: 75 years [range 70-86 years); males 31; PS 0/1/2, n = 22/18/1]. Two patients were excluded because of protocol violation (ascertained to be extensive disease). Twelve patients were accrued at phase I and the number of patients with carboplatin dose-limiting toxicities at levels-1 (n = 6) and -2 (n = 6) were 1(grade 3 hypertension) and 2 (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), respectively. The phase II trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose, total of 35 patients. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 (range 1-4), and the median radiation dose was 54Gy (range 36-60). Toxicities were generally mild.

Method(s): Records of patients with anal squamous cell carcinoma from January 2001 to December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Tc99 lymphoscintigraphy was performed in all the clinically inguinal negative patients, followed by radio-guided surgical removal of the inguinal SLN. All patients were treated with combined radiochemotherapy. In patients with negative sentinel nodes, the inguinal area was excluded in the radiotherapy field. Result(s): A total of 123 patients, 76 females (61.8%), mean age 60.1 +/- 12.19 years old, underwent intraoperative lymph node retrieval. The histological analysis showed metastasis in the SLN in 28 patients (22.8%). The mean follow-up was 43.44 +/- 31.86 months. No inguinal recurrence was observed in patients with negative inguinal sentinel node(s). A statistically significant difference was observed for overall and disease-free survivals in a patient with positive and negative inguinal sentinel nodes.

2124,"The value of 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT over conventional SPECT in the evaluation of parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia As SPECT/CT technology evolves, its applications and indications need to be evaluated clinically for more efficient and cost-effective use. This retrospective study evaluated the clinical value of simultaneously acquired (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT versus conventional SPECT in diagnosing and locating parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. METHOD(S): Immediately and 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 740-925 MBq of (99m)Tc-sestamibi, static planar images of the neck and chest were obtained. SPECT/CT images were acquired 30 minutes after injection. Two experienced masked readers independently evaluated whether conventional SPECT images provided information beyond what was available from the planar images either by changing the diagnosis or by better locating the glands and whether the SPECT/CT images provided information beyond what was available from the planar plus conventional SPECT images. Forty-eight consecutive patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism were included in the study. The 32 whose scans showed positive results underwent surgical resection and were examined histopathologically. RESULT(S): Planar and SPECT imaging, with or without CT fusion, identified 89% of the surgically confirmed diseased parathyroid glands. Use of SPECT/CT changed the diagnosis in only 1 patient (2%) from positive to negative and better located the glands in only 4 patients (8%). SPECT/CT was particularly helpful in locating the 2 ectopic parathyroid adenomas diagnosed in this cohort. Tracer retention in diseased glands did not correlate with histologic characteristics. Also, biochemical markers did not correlate with the scan findings. CONCLUSION(S): SPECT/CT has no significant clinical value additional to that of conventional SPECT for parathyroid imaging except in locating ectopic parathyroid glands. Eliminating the CT acquisition will spare patients the additional time, radiation exposure, and expense.",Excluded
1011,"Long-Term outcome of the treatment of high-risk tenosynovial giant cell tumor/pigmented villonodular synovitis with radiotherapy and surgery BACKGROUND: The treatment of diffuse tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) requires extensive surgical resection of the hypertrophic synovium and multiple soft tissue masses yet still may result in high rates of local failure. The authors of this report examined their experience in treating patients with advanced/multiply recurrent TGCT with a combination of surgery and external-beam radiotherapy. METHOD(S): Fifty patients who were treated for TGCT with radiotherapy and surgery from 1972 to 2006 were identified. Patient demographics, radiotherapy treatment parameters, surgical treatment, and oncologic and functional outcomes were evaluated. All patients had pathologic review at presentation and required at least 1 year follow-up. RESULT(S): Forty-nine patients had diffuse TGCT with both intra-articular and extra-articular disease (1 had malignant TGCT). Twenty-eight patients (56%) were referred after at least 1 local recurrence. Thirty patients (60%) underwent at least 2 operations before radiotherapy. The mean dose of radiation delivered was 39.8 gray. At a mean follow-up of 94 months (range, 19-330 months), 47 patients (94%) had not developed a recurrence or had stable disease/signal characteristics on serial cross-sectional imaging (for those patients who had gross residual disease at the time of radiotherapy). Two patients required subsequent total hip arthroplasty because of progressive osteoarthritis, and there were 4 cases of avascular necrosis (only 1 post-Treatment). Forty-one patients had good/excellent function. CONCLUSION(S): For patients with extensive or multiple local relapses or when surgery alone would result in a large burden of residual disease or major functional loss, the addition of moderate-dose adjuvant radiotherapy provided excellent local control while maintaining good function with low treatment-related morbidity. © 2012 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
1854,"Application of an artificial neural network model for early outcome prediction of gamma knife radiosurgery in patients with trigeminal neuralgia and determining the relative importance of risk factors Objectives: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a minimally invasive modality for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Outcome prediction of this modality is very important for proper case selection. The aim of this study was to create artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the clinical outcomes after gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in patients with TN, based on preoperative clinical factors. Patients and Methods: We used the clinical findings of 155 patients who were underwent GKRS (from March 2000 to march 2015) at Iran Gamma Knife center, Teheran, Iran. Univariate analysis was performed for a long list of risk factors, and those with P-Value < 0.2 were used to create back-propagation ANN models to predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia after GKRS. Pain reduction was defined as BNI score 3a or lower and hypoesthesia was defined as BNI score 3 or 4. Result(s): Typical trigeminal neuralgia (TTN) (P-Value = 0.018) and age>65 (P-Value = 0.040) were significantly associated with successful pain reduction and three other variables including radiation dosage >85 (P-Value = 0.098), negative history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.133) and depression (P-Value = 0.190). On the other hand, radio dosage>85 (P-Value = 0.008) was significantly associated with hypoesthesia, other related risk factors (with p-Value<0.2), were history of multiple sclerosis (P-Value = 0.106), pain duration more than 10 years before GKRS (P-Value = 0.115), history of depression (P-Value = 0.139), history of percutaneous ablative procedures (P-Value = 0.148) and history of diabetes mellitus (P-Value = 0.169).ANN models could predict pain reduction and hypoesthesia with the accuracy of 84.5% and 91.5% respectively. By mutual elimination of each factor in this model we could also evaluate the contribution of each factor in the predictive performance of ANN. Conclusion(s): The findings show that artificial neural networks can predict post operative outcomes in patients who underwent GKRS with a high level of accuracy. Also the contribution of each factor in the prediction of outcomes can be determined using the trained network.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
630,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1989,"Is there need for radioimmunotherapy? results of a phase I/II study in patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas using lutetium-177-DOTA-rituximab AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the clinical response to 177Lutetium-DOTA-rituximab (177Lu-D-R) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular, mantle cell or other indolent lymphomas such as marginal zone lymphoma as well as to put these results into context with other therapy options for these patients., METHODS: Treatment consisted of cold rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 and day 8 and 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab on day 8. Reassessment was done at week 10. Thirty-one patients (males=17, females=14, median number of pretreatments: 3) were treated in seven cohorts. Escalation of injected activity was carried out in steps of 5 mCi/m2. Dosimetry was performed in the first 20 patients., RESULTS: The MTD was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities. Significant anemia only occurred at dose level 7. We observed the nadir of platelets after a median of 36 days from treatment with 177Lu-D-R and a nadir of granulocytes after a median of 50 days from 177Lu-D-R treatment. Non-hematological toxicity was negligible. We observed clinical responses at all dose levels and for all lymphoma entities. Some of the responses were durable; the longest follow up in complete remission is currently over eight years., CONCLUSION: The MTD of 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Non hematologic toxicity was negligible. Responses were seen in all lymphoma entities and at all dose levels tested. Further testing seems to be most promising mainly in follicular and marginal zone lymphoma in particular as the results compare well to other therapy options for these patients with regard to effectiveness, toxicity and discomfort for the patients.",Excluded
285,"Sonographic assessment of acute changes in plaque size and echogenicity and in intima-media thickness of carotid arteries after neck radiation therapy Ultrasonic assessment of acute changes in carotid artery walls before and after neck radiation therapy (RT). Fifty cancer patients scheduled for curative neck irradiation were included and underwent sonographic examination of carotid arteries, with assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque size and echogenicity before and immediately after completion of RT. IMT was linearly correlated with age and before RT (r = 0.267, p = 0.007) and increased after RT (0.68 +/- 0.11 versus 0.87 +/- 0.16, p < 0.001), without correlation with total RT dose and protocol. New plaques (six hypoechoic, one hyperechoic, and one calcified) were found in eight patients after RT, while 17 of the 44 plaques that were present before RT increased in size, and 8 soft and 1 dense plaques in nine patients became calcified. Radiation in the acute phase not only increases the IMT but also causes new plaque formation and changes in plaque size and echogenicity. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2256,"Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.",Excluded
1764,"Differential diagnosis of gallbladder ascariasis debris: the added value of contrast enhanced ultrasound with high frequency transducer Ascariasis debris of the gallbladder is a very rare incidental or symptomatic presentation. Ascaris debris has a pseudotumorous appearance and may be confused with neoplasia. The aim of the current retrospective study is to investigate the value of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the differential diagnosis of ascariasis debris and neoplasia of the gallbladder., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conventional B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) and CEUS were performed for solitary echo-rich gallbladder lesions. Analysis of the CEUS enhancement pattern of the lesions was conducted according to the current EFSUMB guidelines. Two radiologists assessed the CEUS enhancement patterns in consensus. The final gold standard was surgery with histological examination or imaging follow-up., RESULTS: A total of 9 patients with final diagnoses of gallbladder ascariasis debris were included. As a control group 26 solitary hyperechoic gallbladder lesions without shadowing were included as a control group. The typical zigzag morphology with multiple echogenic parallel lines without shadow were detected inside the lumen of the gallbladder in 6 patients. After injection of 2.4 ml ultrasound contrast agents, all hyperechoic gallbladder ascariasis debris lesions showed no enhancement. All patients in the control group with similar BMUS morphology showed contrast enhancement., CONCLUSIONS: Real time visualization of contrast enhancement without radiation exposure is one of the main advantages of CEUS over other diagnostic modalities to differentiate ascariasis debris in the gallbladder from enhancing neoplasia. Thus, surgery and other interventions and their complications could be avoided.",Excluded

Patients with plexopathies secondary to tumor or irradiation complained of pain in the ipsilateral lower extremity. Computed tomography of the pelvis was the most accurate method of documenting tumor in the region of the lumbosacral plexus. Radiation therapy records of patients with cervical carcinoma were reviewed with respect to positioning of intracavitary radium, which was thought to be responsible for the development of radiation-induced plexopathies.

1089,"Genetic damage at specific gene loci in Drosophila with betatron X-rays The mutation rate was determined for mature sperm at eight specific gene loci on the third chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster using the low ion density radiations of 22 Mev betatron X-rays. A dose of 3000 rads of betatron X-rays produced a mutation rate of 4.36 X 10(-8) per rad/locus. Among the mutations observed, 66% were recessive lethals and 34% viable when homozygous. Only one of the 24 viable mutations was associated with a chromosome aberration. Among the 47 recessive lethals, no two-break aberrations were detected in 48.9% of the lethals, deletions were associated with 42.2%, inversions with 6.7% and translocations with 2.2%.-When these genetic results are compared to those for 250 KV X-rays, the mutation rate for betatron treatments was slightly lower (.76), the recessive lethal rate among induced mutations was higher, and the chromosome aberrations among lethal mutations were slightly lower than with 250 KV X-rays. Although the two types of irradiations differ by an ion density of approximately ten, the amount and types of inheritable genetic damage induced by the two radiations in mature sperm were not significantly different.",Excluded

Purpose: To review treatment outcomes for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically operable patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using a Japanese multi-institutional database. Patients and Methods: Between 1995 and 2004, a total of 87 patients with Stage I NSCLC (median age, 74 years; T1N0M0, n = 65; T2N0M0, n = 22) who were medically operable but refused surgery were treated using SBRT alone in 14 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. Total dose was 45-72.5 Gy at the isocenter, administered in 3-10 fractions. Median calculated biological effective dose was 116 Gy (range, 100-141 Gy). Data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): During follow-up (median, 55 months), cumulative local control rates for T1 and T2 tumors at 5 years after SBRT were 92% and 73%, respectively. Pulmonary complications above Grade 2 arose in 1 patient (1.1%). Five-year overall survival rates for Stage IA and IB subgroups were 72% and 62%, respectively. One patient who developed local recurrences safely underwent salvage surgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe and promising as a radical treatment for operable Stage I NSCLC. The survival rate for SBRT is potentially comparable to that for surgery. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2378,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included

The temporal occurrence of this loss of osseous homeostasis has not to the present been shown. Purpose(s): To report the preoperative scintigraphic imaging findings in 79 patients with MRI documented medial meniscus tears and normal radiographs. Material(s) and Method(s): 79 adults (66 males and 13 females) without a history of prior injury or surgery between the ages of 27 and 61 (mean age 41) were included in the study. All patients had a normal preoperative Rosenberg x-ray (weight bearing PA radiograph) an MRI diagnostic of a structurally damaged medial meniscus, and a standard three-hour delayed technetium 99m-MDP bone scan of the knees. Result(s): 77/79 (97%) of the technetium bone scans were positive (increased scintigraphic activity) manifesting loss of osseous homeostasis in the medial compartment of the knees with documented torn medial meniscus findings of in the face of normal structural bone imaging . All patients had surgical documentation of the medial meniscus tears. Discussion(s): Loss of osseous homeostasis of the medial compartment of knees with documented medial meniscus tears was present at a time when the radiographic findings were normal. The conceptualization of the extent of the pathology in such patients needs to include loss of osseous homeostasis. Future studies documenting the post-operative history of surgically treated patients with medial meniscus tears may yield information of interest regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. It is postulated that the persistent post-operative loss of osseous homeostasis may identify those knees as ones at risk of the early development of OA, whereas the restoration of osseous homeostasis may be an important marker that such knees are not at risk for the development of OA.",Excluded

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 223 patients with T1b to T3a prostate cancer and a median (range) age of 66 (50-82) years were treated with permanent seed implantation from November 1990 to March 1998. They were followed for a median (range) of 8.2 (7-14.1) years using prospective quality-of-life measures. Erectile function (EF) was assessed using a physician-assigned score and beginning in June 2000; the validated International Index of EF (IIEF-5) was used as a complementary method to quantify late EF. No adjustment was made to differentiate sexual function with or with no pharmacological intervention for EF. Pearson's chi-square test and Student's t-test were used to compare the groups. RESULT(S): Of the 223 men, 131 (59%) had optimal EF before their brachytherapy; of these, 51 (40%) at the last follow-up evaluation were using either a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (44, 86%), yohimbine (two, 4%) or alprostadil (five, 10%). The age at implantation was highly predictive of current EF; 23 of 25 (92%) men aged 50-59 years had a current EF of >=2; those aged 60-69 and 70-78 years had an EF of >=2 in 48/75 (64%) and 18/31 (58%) (P = 0.01).

Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were calculated from attenuation values measured in caudate nucleus, frontal white matter, anterior ventricle horn, fourth ventricle, and pons. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the reconstruction algorithms, evaluated anonymized multiplanar reformations of 2.5 mm with respect to depiction of different parenchymal structures and impact of artefacts on IQ with a five-point scale (0: unacceptable, 1: less than average, 2: average, 3: above average, 4: excellent)., Results: MBIR decreased artefacts more effectively than ASiR (p < 0.01). The median depiction score for MBIR was 3, whereas the median value for ASiR was 2 (p < 0.01). SNR and CNR were significantly higher in MBIR than ASiR (p < 0.01)., Conclusions: MBIR showed significant improvement of IQ parameters compared to ASiR. As CCT is an examination that is frequently required, the use of MBIR may allow for substantial reduction of radiation exposure caused by medical diagnostics.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded

1332,"Concurrent Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) and Radiation Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: A Prospective Safety and Feasibility Study Background: TTFields are a loco-regional, anti-mitotic treatment comprising low-intensity alternating electric fields. In the EF-14 study of newly diagnosed glioblastoma (ndGBM), TTFields in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) significantly improved survival vs. TMZ alone. In preclinical studies TTFields had a radiosensitizing effect and increased the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT). This study prospectively evaluated the feasibility and safety of TTFields administered concurrently with RT and TMZ in ndGBM patients. Method(s): Patients with histologically confirmed ndGBM were treated with TTFields/RT/TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ/TTFields. TTFields (200 kHz) were delivered for >=18 hours/day with transducer arrays removed during RT delivery. RT was administered to the tumor bed in 30 fractions (total dose 60 Gy) combined with daily TMZ (75 mg/m2). In the adjuvant phase, patients received monthly TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 for 5 days) plus TTFields. Patients were followed for 24 months or until second disease progression. The primary outcome was safety of the combined therapies; secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Adverse events (AEs) were graded per CTCAE v4.0. Result(s): Ten patients were enrolled at a single center between April and December 2017. Median age was 60.2 years, median Karnofsky Performance Score was 90.0, and 80% patients were male. Five (50%) patients had undergone tumor resection while the remainder had biopsy only. Eight patients experienced >=1 RT treatment delay; delays were unrelated to TTFields treatment. All patients experienced >=1 AE. Three patients suffered from serious AEs (urinary tract infection, confusional state, and decubitus ulcer) that were considered unrelated to TTFields. The most common AE was skin toxicity, reported in eight (80%) patients; all were of low severity (CTCAE grade 1-2) and were reported as related to TTFields treatment. Median PFS from enrollment was 8.9 months; median OS was not reached at the time of study closure. Conclusion(s): Eighty percent of patients experienced grade 1-2 TTFields-related skin toxicity. No other TTFields-related toxicities were observed without an increase in RT- or TMZ-related toxicities as a result of combining TTFields with these therapies. Preliminary efficacy results are promising and warrant further investigation of concurrent TTFields/RT/TMZ treatment in ndGBM patients.© Copyright © 2020 Bokstein, Blumenthal, Limon, Harosh, Ram and Grossman.",Excluded

Sixty patients who were at high risk of developing bladder tumors (BT) were divided into two groups according to whether their EP images were obtained using an NI of 9.88 (29 patients; group A) or an NI of 20 and pNRF (31 patients; group B). The CT dose index volume (CTDI(vol)) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder with respect to the anterior pelvic fat were compared in both groups. Qualitative assessment of the urinary bladder for image noise, sharpness, streak artifacts, homogeneity, and the conspicuity of polypoid or sessile-shaped BTs with a short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm was performed using a 3-point scale., RESULTS: The phantom study showed noise reduction of approximately 40% and 76% dose reduction between group A and group B.

Based on the pharmacokinetic data in 13 subjects the radiation doses to single organs were calculated according to MIRD pamphlet No. 11 and the effective dose defined by ICRP 60 as an indicator of radiation dose to the total body. The liver received the highest radiation dose of about 2.2 mGy per 1500 MBq of injected 15O-butanol, which is the typical amount of administered tracer in one rCBF measurement. The dose to the kidneys was 1.6 mGy, to the stomach 0.8 mGy, and to the brain 0.16 mGy. The effective dose was 0.54 mGy, which was similar to that of H2(15)O, but lower than the effective dose from C15O2 in amounts typically applied in human rCBF studies.",Excluded
3144,"Late Effects of Head and Neck Radiotherapy on Pulp Vitality Assessed by Pulse Oximetry INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included
3267,"Radioembolization-induced tumor calcifications as a surrogate marker of tumor response in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma Background/Aim: Tumoral calcification after chemotherapy or radiation therapy has been reported in various cancer patients, but not after radioembolization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of radioembolization-induced tumor calcification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by radioembolization. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study comprised patients with single nodular HCC who underwent yttrium-90 radioembolization between November 2015 and April 2019. The presence of tumoral calcification was visually assessed on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. Result(s): Fiftyfive patients (64.8+/-11.8 years, 43 men) were evaluated. Tumoral calcification was present in 21 (38.2%) of 55 patients in the one-month CT scan (calcification group). The complete response rate for the primary index tumor was 72.7% (40 of 55) in the total study population, and 100% (21 of 21) in the calcification group, respectively. The calcification group had a longer local progression-free survival rate than the noncalcification group (p=0.017). Conclusion(s): Radioembolizationinduced tumoral calcification is relatively common and can be used as an early surrogate marker of complete response.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1620,"Upper versus lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A direct comparison of clinical presentation, outcomes and the risk factors Objectives. Gastrointestinal bleeding is a frequent cause of hospital admission and is a factor in hospital morbidity and mortality. Understanding the cause and specific differences between the onset, signs and symptoms and evolution of upper and lower GI bleeding is essential for proper treatment. Our purpose was to compare prevalence, the onset, clinical outcomes and resource utilization between subjects with lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Materials and methods. We did a retrospective study, during the period from January 1st 2018 to 15 March 2019, on batch of 418 patients admitted in Gastroenterology and Hepatology Clinic of Timisoara with gastrointestinal bleeding. Using clinical observations, assessing the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level, hemoglobin concentration, platelet, white blood cell counts, proteins level, electrolytes, creatinine, urea and with the help of the endoscopy Results. Our study group includes 418 patients admitted in clinic with gastrointestinal bleeding. There is a higher prevalence of a upper gastrointestinal bleeding 80,14%(335) compared to lower gastrointestinal bleedings prevalence 19,86% (83). Etiology, for upper gastrointestinal bleeding includes: peptic ulcer 47,9%, esophageal and gastric varices 22,80%, Mallory- Weiss syndrome 4,65%, gastric cancer 2,32%, vascular ectasia 2,79%, Dieulafoy lesion 2,79%, esophageal ulcer 0,46%, jejunal bleeding 0,46%. For lower gastrointestinal bleeding etiology includes: diverticulum or diverticulosis 30,86%, hemorrhoids 18,51%, colonic polyps 14,81%, colonic cancer 7,41%, inflammatory bowel disease 4,93%,ischemic colitis 1,23%,irradiation colitis 3,70%. A 7,34% percentage of the GI bleeding didn't have an obvious cause.The mean age for UGIB was 58(+/-20) years and for LGIB 68(+/-5) years.Subjects with UGIB compared to LGIB had greater admission hemodynamic instability including tachycardia, lower blood pressure or shock. Severe anemia was present at 30% of patients with LGIB and at 52,13% of patients with UGIB. Creatinine, urea ratio was grown in UGIB. Generally a low level of protein is more common in LGIB group. For the other biological parameters evaluated there is no significant difference between UGIB group and LGIB group. Hematochezia and bloody diarrhea are most common in LGIB but they also appeared in 1,26% of UGIB. Melena appeared in 3, 57 % of LGIB (small bowel or cecal bleeding). Mortality was 11,94% in UGIB group and 6,02% in LGIC group. Resource utilization was similar in UGIB and LGIB including mean costs, length of stay and number of endoscopic procedures. Conclusions. This presentation could be useful for a rapid diagnostic and therapeutic orientation and and appreciation of the prognosis of bleeding. Is also useful for assessing the severity of the bleedingand choosing the optimal moment of endoscopy.",Excluded
1491,"Onsite versus offsite radiation treatment of malignant spinal cord compression: Lessons from a safety net health system Objective: Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is an oncologic emergency that often warrants emergent treatment; but, it is unclear whether radiation treatment (RT) can be optimally managed from an offsite radiotherapy facility. Method(s): Patient charts from consecutive patients with MSCC who were treated with radiotherapy alone at either an onsite hospital radiation department (from 2008 to 2012) or an offsite radiotherapy centre (2012-2015) were reviewed. Patient clinical parameters were compared across groups with either the chi2 test or Fisher's exact test, while survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. The primary end points were ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): A total of 45 patients were identified, with 19 patients treated onsite in the hospital department and 26 patients treated at the offsite radiotherapy centre with median follow-up of 42 days vs 48.5 days, respectively. The ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival were not significantly different between the two eras. Patients treated in-hospital were more likely to start treatment the same day as the consult (""sim and treat"") (79% vs 27%, p = 0.006) and were more likely to not complete treatment (26% vs 4%, p = 0.029) as compared with those treated in the offsite centre. Conclusion(s): Patients with MSCC can be feasibly treated at an offsite radiotherapy centre with outcomes similar to those treated in-hospital. Advances in knowledge: This is the first study in literature to compare outcomes between onsite and offsite RT of MSCC.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

2556,"Overexpression of AIB1 predicts resistance to chemoradiotherapy and poor prognosis in patients with primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is frequently overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the significance of AIB1 expression in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sensitivity and its effect on prognosis are still unclear. In this study, the expression of AIB1 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 98 biopsy specimens of primary ESCC patients treated with definitive CRT. AIB1 overexpression was found in 63/98 (64.3%) of the ESCCs. There was a significant association between AIB1 overexpression and distant lymph node metastases (P = 0.011), but not regional lymph node metastases. In the M0 subgroup, overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in stage T4 than in stage T2-3 (66.7%vs 38.5%, P = 0.031). In addition, AIB1 expression was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with CRT response, in which overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in the CRT resistant group than in the CRT effective group (86.5%vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that AIB1 overexpression was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (P <0.001). Furthermore, AIB1 expression could stratify patient survival in stages T2-3, T4, N1, and M0 (P < 0.05), as well as in the CRT effective group (P < 0.05), and AIB1 overexpression and CRT resistance were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors for both PFS and DSS in multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that overexpression of AIB1 is a useful predictor of CRT resistance and an independent molecular marker of poor prognosis for ESCC patients.",Excluded
1509,"Gamma Knife surgery for clival epidural-osseous dural arteriovenous fistulas OBJECTIVE Clival epidural-osseous dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is often associated with a large nidus, multiple arterial feeders, and complex venous drainage. In this study the authors report the outcomes of clival epidural-osseous DAVFs treated using Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS Thirteen patients with 13 clival epidural-osseous DAVFs were treated with GKS at the authors' institution between 1993 and 2015. Patient age at the time of GKS ranged from 38 to 76 years (median 55 years). Eight DAVFs were classified as Cognard Type I, 4 as Type IIa, and 1 as Type IIa+b. The median treatment volume was 17.6 cm3 (range 6.2-40.3 cm3). The median prescribed margin dose was 16.5 Gy (range 15-18 Gy). Clinical and radiological follow-ups were performed at 6-month intervals. Patient outcomes after GKS were categorized as 1) complete improvement, 2) partial improvement, 3) stationary, and 4) progression. RESULTS All 13 patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement, and on catheter angiography 12 of the 13 patients had complete obliteration and 1 patient had partial obliteration. The median follow-up period was 26 months (range 14-186 months). The median latency period from GKS to obliteration was 21 months (range 8-186 months). There was no intracranial hemorrhage during the follow-up period, and no deaths occurred. Two adverse events were observed following treatment, and 2 patients required repeat GKS treatment with eventual complete obliteration. CONCLUSIONS Gamma Knife surgery offers a safe and effective primary or adjuvant treatment modality for complex clival epidural-osseous DAVFs. All patients in this case series demonstrated symptomatic improvement, and almost all patients attained complete obliteration.Copyright © AANS, 2018.",Excluded
2328,"Cryoballoon vs. radiofrequency contact force ablation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a propensity score analysis BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency and cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation are common approaches for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treatment, showing similar results in recent multicenter studies, including heterogeneous tools and protocols. The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety. Cryoablation requires longer fluoroscopy exposure compared with radiofrequency, although this is reduced by increased experience.",Excluded
1842,"Phase II study of preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for rectal cancer PURPOSE: The addition of concomitant chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy is considered the standard of care for patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. The combined treatment modality increases the complete response rate and local control (LC), but has no impact on survival or the incidence of distant metastases. In addition, it is associated with considerable toxicity. As an alternative strategy, we explored prospectively, preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 108 patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art II system. A dose of 46 Gy, in daily fractions of 2 Gy, was delivered to the mesorectum and draining lymph nodes, without concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with an anticipated circumferential resection margin (CRM) of less than 2 mm, based on magnetic resonance imaging, received a SIB to the tumor up to a total dose of 55.2 Gy. Acute and late side effects were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., RESULTS: A total of 102 patients presented with cT3-4 tumors; 57 patients entered the boost group and 51 the no-boost group. One patient in the no-boost group developed a radio-hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a complete tumor remission, a Grade 3 acute and Grade 5 late enteritis. No other Grade >=3 acute toxicities occurred. With a median follow-up of 32 months, Grade >=3 late gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed in 6% and 4% of the patients, respectively. The actuarial 2-year LC, progression-free survival and overall survival were 98%, 79%, and 93%., CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative helical tomotherapy displays a favorable acute toxicity profile in patients with cT3-4 rectal cancer. A SIB can be safely administered in patients with a narrow CRM and resulted in a promising LC. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
246,"3D histomorphometric quantification of trabecular bones by computed microtomography using synchrotron radiation Conventional bone histomorphometry is an important method for quantitative evaluation of bone microstructure. X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved. The results obtained could be used in forming the basis for comparison of the bone microarchitecture and can be a valuable tool for predicting bone fragility. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

3300,"Toxicities Following Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy Treatment of Locally-Recurrent and Previously Irradiated Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with concomitant cetuximab is an effective treatment option for previously irradiated, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Its local control and overall survival are similar to those of other available treatment options. Each retreatment depends heavily on the prior treatment and every patient is a special case. Based on the experience of our institution and previously published studies, for patients who receive concomitant cetuximab with a median prior radiation therapy dose of 70Gy, we recommend a total dose of 40-44Gy delivered in 5 fractions on alternating days over 1-2 weeks. However, Grade 2 or 3 toxicities are not uncommon. Therefore, in this review, we also report a pilot study that applies a normal tissue complication probability dose-response model to estimate the probability of toxicities in locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck reirradiated with SABR. Although this dose-response model includes concurrent targeted therapy and no comparable model yet exists for SABR without it, complication rates without concurrent biological therapy or chemotherapy should be no higher than those described here.

87,"The QUANTEC criteria for parotid gland dose and their efficacy to prevent moderate to severe patient-rated xerostomia Background. Recently, the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) Group defined dose-volume constraints for the parotid glands to avoid severe xerostomia. The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. Material and methods. The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk. Results. In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met. Conclusions. Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
705,"Assessment of radiation-induced liver injury with computed tomography OBJECTIVE: To review the appearance of radiation-induced liver injury on computer tomography for quantitative assessment of dosimetric changes in different radiological reactions and the influence of time-effect. METHOD(S): The focal liver reactions of 35 patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) for liver malignancies were evaluated, with the applied doses of 36-65 Gy in 4-28 fractions completed in 8-41 days. All patients received nonenhanced CT scan and arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scan 1-6 months after therapy. The liver tissue density in irradiated and nonirradiated liver was compared, and the reaction type and the threshold dose determined radiologically. RESULT(S): On at least one follow-up examination, 51.4% of patients were found to have a focal radiation reaction in the liver. The radiation reaction was hypodense in 43.75% of the follow-up nonenhanced CT examinations and in 19.23% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. It was hyperdense in 42.31% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. The median threshold dose inducing a radiation reaction was 30.8 Gy (range 18-42.8 Gy). The detected threshold dose was positively correlated with the time of detection of the reaction (P=0.041), with a correlation coefficient of -0.473. On arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans, the threshold dose was significantly higher for hyperdense than for hypodense changes (P=0.017). In additional follow-up, the reaction volume decreased and the reaction types changed on arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. CONCLUSION(S): The threshold dose can be different in different radiological reaction types on multiphase CT scans. The detected threshold dose is inversely correlated with the time of detection of the early reaction. Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT is helpful to distinguish radiation reactions from recurrent tumors.",Excluded
3000,"Severity of radiation pneumonitis, from clinical, dosimetric and biological features: a pilot study Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

Twenty-seven patients (nine men, 18 women; mean age, 64 years) with 23 solitary pancreatic tumors underwent dual-energy CT. Two imaging protocols were used: 140 kVp and 385 mA (protocol A) and 80 kVp and 675 mA (protocol B). For both protocols, the following variables were compared during the pancreatic parenchymal phase: contrast enhancement for the aorta, the pancreas, and the portal vein; pancreas-to-tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR); noise; and effective dose. Two blinded, independent readers qualitatively scored the two data sets for tumor detection and image quality. Random-effect analysis of variance tests were used to compare differences between the two protocols., RESULTS: Compared with protocol A, protocol B yielded significantly higher contrast enhancement for the aorta (508.6 HU vs 221.5 HU, respectively), pancreas (151.2 HU vs 67.0 HU), and portal vein (189.7 HU vs 87.3 HU), along with a greater pancreas-to-tumor CNR (8.1 vs 5.9) (P < .001 for all comparisons). No statistically significant difference in tumor detection was observed between the two protocols. Although standard deviation of image noise increased with protocol B (11.5 HU vs 18.6 HU), this protocol significantly reduced the effective dose (from 18.5 to 5.1 mSv; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: A low-tube-voltage, high-tube-current CT technique has the potential to improve the enhancement of the pancreas and peripancreatic vasculature, improve tumor conspicuity, and reduce patient radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase.",Excluded
855,"Physicochemical properties of calcific deposits isolated from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves removed from patients following 2-13 years function The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of calcific deposits that cause the failure of tissue-derived heart valve bioprostheses. This was done in an effort to understand the mechanism of pathologic biomineralization in the cardiovascular system and potentially prevent deterioration of bioprostheses. Calcific deposits taken from 10 failed bioprosthetic valves that had been implanted in patients for 2-13 years were characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and solubility measurements. The combined results identified the biomineral as an apatitic calcium phosphate salt with substantial incorporation of sodium, magnesium and carbonate. The average Ca/PO4 ratio for this young"" pathologic biomineral was approximately 1.3, considerably lower than approximately 1.7 found in mature atherosclerotic plaque biomineral and mature skeletal biomineral, both of which approximate hydroxyapatite in composition. Deproteinated calcific deposits from bioprostheses had thermodynamic solubilities comparable to those of both atherosclerotic plaque, typical pathologic biomineral and hydrolyzed octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5 H2O), a proposed precursor phase to biomineral apatite. This later finding, together with chemical composition and structural details of the bioprosthetic deposits themselves, supports a mechanism of cardiovascular calcification in which OCP plays a crucial role in the formation of the final apatitic phase. This suggests an approach toward prevention of bioprosthetic tissue calcification through control of the formation of the kinetically favored OCP precursor and/or its transformation into bioapatite.""",Excluded
2235,"Natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for managing radiation-induced skin reactions in patients with cancer: A phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial Purpose: To investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin versus aqueous cream for preventing and managing radiation-induced skin reactions., Methods and Materials: A total of 174 patients were randomized and participated in the study. Patients received either cream 1 (the natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin) or cream 2 (aqueous cream). Skin toxicity, pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life scores were collected for up to 4 weeks after radiation treatment., Results: Patients who received cream 1 had a significantly lower average level of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events at week 3 (P<.05) but had statistically higher average levels of skin toxicity at weeks 7, 8, and 9 (all P<.001). Similar results were observed when skin toxicity was analyzed by grades. With regards to pain, patients in the cream 2 group had a significantly higher average level of worst pain (P<.05) and itching (P=.046) compared with the cream 1 group at week 3; however, these differences were not observed at other weeks. In addition, there was a strong trend for cream 2 to reduce the incidence of grade 2 or more skin toxicity in comparison with cream 1 (P=.056). Overall, more participants in the cream 1 group were required to use another topical treatment at weeks 8 (P=.049) and 9 (P=.01)., Conclusion: The natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin seems to have similar effects for managing skin toxicity compared with aqueous cream up to week 5; however, it becomes significantly less effective at later weeks into the radiation treatment and beyond treatment completion (week 6 and beyond). There were no major differences in pain, itching, and skin-related quality of life. In light of these results, clinicians and patients can base their decision on costs and preferences. Overall, aqueous cream seems to be a more preferred option.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1072,"Polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes in radiation-related and sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) etiologically occurs as a radiation-induced or sporadic malignancy. Genetic factors contributing to the susceptibility to either form remain unknown. In this retrospective case-control study, we evaluated possible associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate DNA damage response genes (ATM, XRCC1, TP53, XRCC3, MTF1) and risk of radiation-induced and sporadic PTC. A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively). The ATM IVS22-77 T > C and TP53 Arg72Pro SNPs interacted with radiation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively). ATM IVS22-77 associated with the increased risk of sporadic PTC (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) whereas TP53 Arg72Pro correlated with the higher risk of radiogenic PTC (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-2.36). In the analyses of ATM/TP53 (rs1801516/rs664677/rs609429/rs1042522) combinations, the GG/TC/CG/GC genotype strongly associated with radiation-induced PTC (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.17-3.78). The GG/CC/GG/GG genotype displayed a significantly increased risk for sporadic PTC (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.57-6.99). The results indicate that polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes may be potential risk modifiers of ionizing radiation-induced or sporadic PTCs.",Included
3297,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A retrospective controlled study Background: In the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is under-evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of NAC plus IMRT and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on locoregionally advanced NPC. Method(s): Between January 2004 and December 2008, 240 cases of locoregionally advanced NPC confirmed by pathologic assessment in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 240 patients, 117 received NAC followed by IMRT, and 123 were treated with CCRT plus AC. The NAC + IMRT group received a regimen that included cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The CCRT + AC group received cisplatin concurrently with radiotherapy, and subsequently received adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU. The survival rates were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the survival curves were compared using a log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 78.0, 87.9, 79.0, and 69.8%, respectively, for the NAC + IMRT group and 78.7, 84.8, 76.2, and 65.6%, respectively, for the CCRT + AC group. There were no significant differences in survival between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, age (<50 years vs. >=50 years) and overall stage (III vs. IV) were found to be independent predictors for OS and DFS; furthermore, the overall stage was a significant prognostic factor for DMFS. Compared with the CCRT + AC protocol, the NAC + IMRT protocol significantly reduced the occurrence rates of grade 3-4 nausea-vomiting (6.5 vs. 1.5%, P = 0.023) and leukopenia (9.7 vs. 0.8%, P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): The treatment outcomes of the NAC + IMRT and CCRT + AC groups were similar. Distant metastasis remained the predominant mode of treatment failure.Copyright © 2016 Qiu et al.",Excluded
1431,"Assessment of aortic annulus dimensions for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with high-pitch dual-source CT: Comparison of systolic high-pitch vs. multiphasic data acquisition Objectives: To evaluate a systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac computed tomography (CT) angiography for planning transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Method(s): Patients referred for TAVI underwent a combined CT imaging with retrospective, multiphasic ECG-gating of the heart and systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac CT angiography. Consecutive patients were retrospectively included in this study group. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during the high-pitch ECG prediction phase. Aortic annulus area (AAA) was planimetrically quantified on both datasets. While only one moment of cardiac cycle was available for measurements in the high-pitch CT, the point of time in the multiphasic CT was chosen, where AAA yielded maximum size. Hypothetical prosthesis sizing was compared between multiphasic vs. high-pitch CT. Result(s): Among 61 patients (44.2 % men, mean age: 83.3 +/- 5.5 years) average heart rate and HRV were 71.0 +/- 13.4 bpm and 7.3 +/- 8.5 bpm. 20 patients (32.7 %) had atrial fibrillation at the time of image acquisition. There was a strong correlation of AAA as derived from multiphasic vs. the high-pitch CT (r = 0.98). The difference in AAA was 10.5 +/- 17.1mm2 (455.1 +/- 83.0 mm2 for multiphasic vs. 444.5 +/- 87.2 mm2 for high-pitch CT) and did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Hypothetical prosthesis sizing showed an agreement in 55 of 61 patients (90.2 %). A sizing based on the high-pitch CT resulted in smaller prosthesis choice in 6 patients, all of them suffering from atrial fibrillation. Mean effective radiation dose was 10.9 +/- 6.1 mSv for cardiac CTA and 4.1 +/- 1.0 mSv for high-pitch CTA. Conclusion(s): For patients with sinus rhythm, systolic high-pitch aortoiliac CTA provides adequate prosthesis size selection as compared with multiphasic ECG-gated cardiac CTA and may result in significantly reduced radiation exposition.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
2046,"Application of Digital Tomosynthesis in the Diagnosis of Urolithiasis: Comparison with MDCT Objective: To investigate the diagnostic value of digital tomosynthesis in urolithiasis compared with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). Subjects and Methods: This study received the approval of institutional review board and obtained the informed consents of all subjects. Fifty patients with acute renal colic and hematuria from February 2014 to February 2015 were enrolled. They underwent both MDCT and digital tomosynthesis. Images were interpreted by two experienced radiologists, and inter-reader agreement was assessed. The diagnostic performance of urinary stones with digital tomosynthesis and MDCT was compared. The entrance surface dose (ESD) in MDCT and digital tomosynthesis for patients was measured and compared. Result(s): No significant difference was found between digital tomosynthesis and MDCT in the diagnosis of urinary stones (X2 = 1.357, p > 0.05). The ESD in digital tomosynthesis was lower than that in both routine-dose and low-dose MDCT for patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Digital tomosynthesis has great diagnostic value in urolithiasis. Compared with MDCT, digital tomosynthesis can significantly decrease ESD for patients and financial loan with a similar detection rate.Copyright © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.",Excluded
300,"Estimation of radiation exposure of retrospective gated and prospective triggered 128-slice triple-rule-out CT angiography CT has become an important role in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain to exclude an aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism and acute coronary artery syndrome. However, the additional radiation exposure is a cause of concern and dose saving strategies should be applied, if possible. To estimate effective dose of retrospective gated and prospective ECG-triggered triple-rule-out computed tomography angiography (TRO-CTA). An Alderson-Rando-phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used for dose measurements. Exposure was performed on a 128-slice single source scanner. The following scan parameters were used (retrospective ECG-gated): 120 kV, 190 mAs/rot., collimation 128x0.6 mm, rotation time 0.3 s. Protocols with a simulated heart rate (HR) of 60 and 100 bpm were performed using the standard ECG-pulsing as well as MinDose. Additionally, a prospective triggered TRO-CTA was acquired (HR 60 bpm). The estimated effective dose of retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA ranged from 7.4-13.4 mSv and from 10.1-17.5 mSv for men and women, respectively. Due to radiosensitive breast tissue, women received a significant increased effective dose of up to 64.7% +/- 0.03% (p = 0.028) compared to men. MinDose reduces radiation exposure of up to 33.0% +/- 6.5% in comparison to standard ECG-pulsing (p < 0.001). The effective dose increased significantly with lower heart rates (p < 0.001). Prospective ECG-triggered TRO-CTA showed an effective dose of 5.9 mSv and 8.2 mSv for men and women, respectively. Compared to retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA a significant dose reduction was observed (p < 0.001). Due to the significant different dose exposure, scan protocols should be specifically adapted in a patient- and problem-oriented manner.",Excluded
2367,"Radiation Exposure During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Impact of Arterial Approach and Prosthesis Type Background: The impact of novel alternative access and valve type on radiation exposure during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to determine the impact of a transarterial approach and prosthesis type on physician and patient exposure to radiation during TAVR. Method(s): This was a prospective study including 140 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR by transfemoral (n = 102) or transcarotid (TC) (n = 38) access at 2 centers. Implanted valves were the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; n = 38) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA; n = 102). The primary endpoint was first operator radiation exposure. The secondary endpoint was patient radiation exposure. Result(s): First operator radiation exposure was 4-fold greater during TC TAVR (P < .001). The use of a self-expanding valve was associated with a longer x-ray time (P = .015) and a 2-fold greater first operator radiation dose (P = .018). Patient radiation dose was not significantly affected by arterial approach (P = .055) or valve type (P = .095). After adjustment for potential confounders, the TC approach remained associated with a 174.8% (95% confidence interval, 80.6-318.3, P < .001) increase in first operator radiation dose, whereas the use of a self-expanding valve no longer influenced the first operator dose (P = .630). Conclusion(s): TC access and the use of a self-expanding valve were associated with a 4- and 2-fold greater first operator radiation exposure during TAVR procedures, respectively. Unlike the arterial approach, the effect of bioprosthesis type on radiation exposure was mainly related to x-ray time and was no longer significant after adjustment.Copyright © 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded
2727,"Expandable metallic stent placement for malignant venous stenosis The expandable metallic stent (EMS) is used to dilate narrowed vascular or ductal lumina.

After stent placement, all patients obtained symptomatic relief, and the stenotic ratio improved 20-60% in 7 patients. In one patient, EMS did not expand, but symptom relieved 4 days after stent placement, and following X-ray film showed expansion of EMS. One patient had recurrence of symptom 10 days after stent placement due to dislodgement of EMS. Additional EMS was placed, and symptom improved again. All 8 patients did not suffer recurrence of symptom from 3 weeks to 18 months. We conclude that EMS appears to be useful in patients with venous stenosis caused by malignant tumor.",Excluded
1449,"Radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the subglottic larynx Objective: This study aims to summarize our institution's experience in treating patients with primary subglottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with radiotherapy (RT) and to define the optimal treatment plan for these patients. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients with subglottic SCC curatively treated with RT between 1977 and 2009. T1 and T2 cancers were considered early disease; T3 and T4 lesions were considered advanced disease. Patients were stratified according to whether they received RT alone or RT and surgery. Patients treated surgically tended to have more advanced disease and required a total laryngectomy. Patients were excluded if they had distant metastasis at diagnosis or if their tumor was glottic in origin and extended inferiorly into the subglottis. Result(s): Twelve patients (67 %) had advanced disease, and six patients (33 %) had early disease. Local control was achieved in 100 % of the patients with early disease, regardless of treatment group. Of the patients with advanced disease, local control was achieved in five of the seven patients (71 %) treated with RT alone and in four of the five (80 %) treated with surgery and RT. Ultimate local control was achieved in six of the seven patients (86 %) with advanced disease treated with RT alone. Overall local control was 83 % at 5 years, with a 5-year cause-specific survival of 66 % and a 5-year overall survival of 44 %. Local-regional control mirrored that of local control, with an overall local-regional control rate of 83 %. No patient suffered a severe acute or late complication or acute toxicity during the treatment process. Conclusion(s): Patients with SCC of the subglottic larynx have a high likelihood of local-regional control after undergoing RT along or combined with surgery.

METHOD(S): Twelve histologically confirmed patients with metastatic MTC were included. All patients underwent both 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging and 131I/ 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging. According to the results of the combined imaging, positive patients were selected to be treated with 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) or 131I-MIBG, respectively. The therapeutic procedures of targeted internal radiation were performed with 3.33 GBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of three months. RESULT(S): The imaging procedure was positive in all 12 patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in eight patients, 131I/ 123I-MIBG imaging in six patients. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified four patients to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and five patients with 131 I-MIBG.

Methods Between January 2007 and August 2010, a cohort of consecutive EO patients who underwent coronary angiography was identified in our center's registry of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. Of 21,103 procedures, 564 (2.7%) were performed in unique EO patients: 203 (36%) via the transradial approach; and 361 (64%) via the transfemoral approach.Results The primary outcome, a combined endpoint of major bleeding, access site complications, and nonaccess site complications, occurred in 7.5% of the transfemoral group and 2.0% of the transradial group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10 to 0.88, p = 0.029), an endpoint driven by reductions in major bleeding (3.3% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0 to 0.71, p = 0.015), as well as access site injuries (4.7% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0 to 0.48, p = 0.002). There were no differences in nonaccess site complications (1.7% vs. 2.0%, OR: 1.50, 95% CI: 0.41 to 5.55), but transradial access procedures were associated with an increase in procedure time and patient radiation dose (p < 0.05).Conclusions Transfemoral access for coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention was associated with more bleeding and access site complications when compared with a transradial approach. Important reductions in procedural associated morbidity may be possible with a transradial approach in EO patients. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
1407,"Combining Optimized Image Processing With Dual Axis Rotational Angiography: Toward Low-Dose Invasive Coronary Angiography Background Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) reduces radiation exposure during coronary angiography on older x-ray systems. The purpose of the current study is to quantify patient and staff radiation exposure using DARCA on a modality already equipped with dose-reducing technology. Additionally, we assessed applicability of 1 dose area product to effective dose conversion factor for both DARCA and conventional coronary angiography (CCA) procedures. Methods and Results Twenty patients were examined using DARCA and were compared with 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients selected from a prior study using CCA on the same x-ray modality. All irradiation events are simulated using PCXMC (STUK, Finland) to determine organ and effective doses. Moreover, for DARCA each frame is simulated. Staff dose is measured using active personal dosimeters (DoseAware, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). With DARCA, median cumulative dose area product is reduced by 57% (ie, 7.41 versus 17.19 Gy.cm2). Effective dose conversion factors of CCA and DARCA are slightly different, yet this difference is not statistically significant. The occupational dose at physician's chest, leg, and collar level are reduced by 60%, 56%, and 16%, respectively, of which the first 2 reached statistical significance. Median effective dose is reduced from 4.75 mSv in CCA to 2.22 mSv in DARCA procedures, where the latter is further reduced to 1.79 mSv when excluding ventriculography. Conclusions During invasive coronary angiography, DARCA reduces radiation exposure even further toward low-dose values on a system already equipped with advanced image processing and noise reduction algorithms. For both DARCA and CCA procedures, using 1 effective dose conversion factor of 0.30 mSv.Gy-1.cm-2 is feasible.",Excluded
2271,"Lower body negative pressure: Physiological effects, applications, and implementation This review presents lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a unique tool to investigate the physiology of integrated systemic compensatory responses to altered hemodynamic patterns during conditions of central hypovolemia in humans. An early review published in Physiological Reviews over 40 yr ago (Wolthuis et al. Physiol Rev 54: 566-595, 1974) focused on the use of LBNP as a tool to study effects of central hypovolemia, while more than a decade ago a review appeared that focused on LBNP as a model of hemorrhagic shock (Cooke et al. J Appl Physiol (1985) 96: 1249-1261, 2004). Since then there has been a great deal of new research that has applied LBNP to investigate complex physiological responses to a variety of challenges including orthostasis, hemorrhage, and other important stressors seen in humans such as microgravity encountered during spaceflight. The LBNP stimulus has provided novel insights into the physiology underlying areas such as intolerance to reduced central blood volume, sex differences concerning blood pressure regulation, autonomic dysfunctions, adaptations to exercise training, and effects of space flight. Furthermore, approaching cardiovascular assessment using prediction models for orthostatic capacity in healthy populations, derived from LBNP tolerance protocols, has provided important insights into the mechanisms of orthostatic hypotension and central hypovolemia, especially in some patient populations as well as in healthy subjects. This review also presents a concise discussion of mathematical modeling regarding compensatory responses induced by LBNP. Given the diverse applications of LBNP, it is to be expected that new and innovative applications of LBNP will be developed to explore the complex physiological mechanisms that underline health and disease.Copyright © 2019 the American Physiological Society.",Excluded
2712,"Malignant melanoma in Connecticut and Denmark The rising incidence of malignant melanoma of the skin was reviewed using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (1935-1974) (Eisenberg et al., 1967) and the Danish Cancer Registry (1943-1972) (Clemmesen, 1965, 1974, 1977). A total of 7,530 cases were analyzed according to age, sex and anatomic site. The total age-adjusted incidence rates were similar for these two areas, despite geographic and demographic differences. However, the most rapid changes in melanoma incidence were observed in females from Denmark and males from Connecticut. In addition, the largest increases occurred for lower-extremity lesions in Danish middle-aged women and trunk-neck melanomas in Connecticut middle-aged men. Melanoma of the face was resistant to changing incidence and occurred in an older age group than melanoma of other skin sites. In general, birth cohort analysis confirmed that changing incidence began for persons born around 1900, but the rising incidence for lower-extremity melanomas in women and trunk-neck melanomas in males began earlier. In comparing incidence for anatomic sites by correcting for surface area and melanocyte density, higher than expected rates were seen for melanoma of the face in both sexes and trunk-neck melanomas in males. The data presented supported the concept that a cumulative exposure to solar radiation may be important in the etiology of melanoma of the face, but short, intense sun exposure is probably related to melanoma in other sun-exposed areas, and that melanoma in areas other than the face is responsible for the rising incidence of this disease.",Excluded
1020,"Osteosarcoma: An immunophenotypic study for characterization and behavior Background: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor occurring in second and third decades of life with a second peak later. Biopsy (needle or incision) is necessary for diagnosis along with imaging modalities (X-ray, CT scan etc) and serology. Due to diagnostic dilemma in certain cases and for prognosis of patients, immunohistochemistry is increasingly used. Aim(s): To assess the pathologic features and determinants of osteosarcoma in patients of the Indian subcontinent that would put an insight into its appearance and behavior. Methods and Material: Forty cases of biopsy proven osteosarcoma were selected over a period of three years. Histopathology was done for tumor typing, along with serology (pre and post-operative serum alkaline phosphatase). In all cases TNM staging and immunohistochemistry for antibodies to Osteonectin (ON) (diagnosis), S100 (differentiation), Ki 67 and Her2 (prognosis) was done. Result(s): Serum alkaline phosphatase was high in 37 (92%) cases initially and remained high in metastatic and recurrent lesions. Osteonectin was positive in 38 (95%) cases, S100 in 31 (77%), Ki 67 showed overlapping labeling indices between 4.8-18.8% and Her2 showed more positivity in higher stage tumors. Conclusion(s): Biopsy (along with imaging) is mandatory to diagnose osteosarcoma. Osteonectin is a good immunohistochemical marker to differentiate osteosarcoma from its mimics. For prognostication, serum alkaline phosphatase, post chemotherapy tumor necrosis (more than 90%), lack of Her2 expression are good parameters. S100 and Ki67 were found to have limited role in diagnosis and prognosis of osteosarcoma.Copyright © 2014 Ibn Sina Trust. All rights reserved.",Excluded
846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded
3243,"Impact of low dose myocardial perfusion imaging on patient radiation effective dose and imaging time in real world clinical practice Objectives To demonstrate proof of concept/practicality of reducing medical radiation exposure from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by adopting low dose protocols in real world clinical practice. Methods A cohort of 100 consecutive patients who were referred for MPI to our nuclear medicine service was imaged with a low dose rest-stress MPI protocol. Traditionally used doses of 10 millicuries (mCi) or 370 megabecquerel (MBq) at rest and 30 mCi (1110 MBq) at stress were decreased to half for the low dose protocol, 5 mCi (185 MBq) at rest and 15 mCi (555MBq) at stress. This decision was based on the principle of lowering the injected dose as much as practically feasible while obtaining good diagnostic quality images with similar 1 million count threshold for image acquisition in a reasonable, patient comfortable imaging time [1]. All imaging was performed using an ultrafast, high resolution, dedicated cardiac camera (D-SPECT, Spectrum Dynamics) [2] in upright position for rest and stress. An additional supine stress image was additionally acquired [3]. The low dose patient cohort was retrospectively compared to a cohort of 100 consecutive patients referred to our service for MPI who were imaged using the traditional dose protocol immediately preceding the adoption of the low dose protocol. Comparison between the two groups in different protocols was made using the average values of administered doses in mCi, radiation effective dose in millisieverts (mSv) and the imaging time in minutes: seconds for each rest, stress and total MPI. All patients were imaged using a single day, rest-stress protocol with technetium99m-sestamibi using either exercise or pharmacological stress as determined clinically by the cardiology team. Results A total of 200 patients with 100 patients in each cohort were evaluated. Traditional dose patients had an average age of 69.8 years (y), male: female ratio of 59:41, weight of 85 kilograms (kg), received a dose of 10.4 mCi (385 MBq) at rest, 31.1 mCi (1151 MBq) at stress. Low dose patients had an average age of 66.6 y, male: female ratio of 52:48, weighed 83.3 kg, and received a dose of 5.28 mCi (195 MBq) at rest, 16.0 mCi (592 MBq) at stress. High dose imaging time in minutes: seconds was 8:17 (rest), 1:46 (stress) and 10:03 (total). Low dose imaging time was 14:36 (rest), 3:24 (stress) and 18:00 (total). As compared to traditional dose protocols, low dose protocols demonstrated significant reduction in average radiation effective dose of 49.1% in rest, 48.5% in stress and 48.7% in total rest-stress MPI. As expected, an increase in imaging time was noted in the low dose protocol, with an average increase of 07:20 min in rest, 03:14 min in stress and 10:34 min in total imaging time, which did not significantly impact patient throughput. No patient complaints were encountered with regards to imaging time by the imaging team. All images were of diagnostic quality, acquired by identical parameters of 1 million count threshold for image acquisition and deemed clinically interpretable by a team of board certified clinical nuclear medicine providers. Conclusions MPI contributes significantly to medical radiation exposure [4]. Low dose MPI can be easily implemented clinically using newer high resolution cardiac specific cameras to achieve markedly lower radiation effective doses to the patient population without significantly impacting patient throughput or diagnostic quality of images. Low dose MPI leads to decreasing medical radiation exposure to the patients, their caregivers, medical staff [5] and to the community as a whole.",Excluded
2388,"Human mononuclear cell in vitro activation in microgravity and post-spaceflight The results of postflight and inflight human in vitro lymphocyte experiments have been reviewed. The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded

In a multivariate regression model adjusting for age, sex, family history of thyroid cancer, radiation exposure, nodule size, and American College of Radiology (ACR) TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) score, the isthmus nodules had the highest risk of malignancy (OR = 2.4 [CI 1.5-3.9], p = 0.0007), followed by upper thyroid nodules (OR = 1.8 [CI 1.2-2.7], p = 0.005) and then middle thyroid nodules (OR = 1.5 [CI 1.1-2.0], p = 0.01) compared with lower thyroid nodules. Isthmus nodules were significantly smaller in size compared with middle (p < 0.0001) and lower (p = 0.0004), but not upper nodules (p = 0.25), with a mean size of 15.5 mm (+/-10.7). Conclusion(s): Thyroid nodule location is an independent risk factor in predicting the risk of thyroid cancer. Isthmic nodules carry the highest risk of cancer diagnosis and lower lobe nodules carry the lowest risk.© Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",Excluded
2517,"A study on radiation dose received by patients during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Background: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is considered as the method of choice for treatment of most stone diseases. The present study aims to evaluate radiation dose received by patients undergoing ESWL. Method(s): In total, 46 patients from both genders were referred to the Shohadaye Ashayer hospital of Khorramabad, Iran and were included in the present study. Patients were positioned in anteroposterior (AP) projection and along 30degree anterior oblique (AO) projection upon the X-ray fluoroscopy table and exposures were conducted. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used for radiation dose measurements. To evaluate the entrance surface dose (ESD), each TLD chip was taped on back of patient at the entrance surfaces of the X-ray beam. Result(s): The mean number of stones in each patient was 1.4. The stone sizes ranged from 7 to 29 mm, and a mean of 3200 pulses were need for each patient. The mean ESD in the postero-anterior (PA) and oblique X-ray beam entrance were obtained at 12.04 and 68.84 mGy, respectively. There was linear correlation between patient dose with fluoroscopy time, tube current (mA), tube potential (kVp) and patient position (P < 0.001); however, we found no strong correlation between patient dose with patient body mass (P = 0.837), number of shock wave pulses (P = 0.089), stone size (P = 0.773) and locations (P = 0.463). Conclusion(s): The data obtained in the current study are comparable with information available in the literature. They emphasized that ESWL exposes patients to much more radiation compared to those from conventional radiography and is in the range of computed tomography (CT) procedures. Therefore, following safety guidelines is recommended.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
1044,"Relationship between technical difficulty to cannulate papila of vater and fluoroscopy time Background: Exposure to radiation during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) could have adverse effects on the endoscopic team members and patients. There is an inverse relationship between fluoroscopy time and endoscopist experience. Objective(s): To determine the relationship between the technical difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla, and time to perform the procedure and fluoroscopy time. Method(s): Patients scheduled for ERCP were divided in two groups depending on the degree of difficulty of the process according to Schutz classification: group A (grades 1-3) and group B (grades 4 and 5). We registered demographic variables, reference diagnosis, endoscopic and radiological diagnoses, degree of difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla (Freeman scale), duration of procedure, fluoroscopy time and endoscopic complications. Result(s): 213 patients were included: 101 in group A and 112 in group B. Mean fluoroscopy time was 59.15 seconds in group A and 93.59 seconds in group B (p <0.0001). Mean time to perform the procedure was 13.18 minutes in group A and 20.23 minutes in group B (p <0.0001). Factors related to increased fluoroscopy time were technical difficulty for the CPE according to Schutz (p <0.0001), stent placement (p = 0.021) and hydrostatic dilation (p <0.0001). Conclusion(s): The fluoroscopy time increased proportionally to technical difficulty to perform the procedure. © 2011 Asociacion Mexicana de Gastroenterologia.",Excluded
1947,"Clinical outcomes of graves' ophthalmopathy treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy BACKGROUND: Radiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) has traditionally utilized lateral opposing fields (LOF) or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique. The current study was conducted to report clinical outcomes and therapeutic effects of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating GO patients., METHODS: One hundred sixteen patients with GO were treated with IMRT as initial local therapy between July 2010 and August 2013, with a median follow-up of 62 months (range 45-81 months). Radiotherapy dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions within two to three weeks. The immediate and long-term response to IMRT was evaluated in GO severity score and in each category of symptoms. Acute and long-term complications were recorded to assess its safety., RESULTS: Symptom severity score significantly fell from the start of treatment to 4- or 6- month post-IMRT (P < 0.01). In total, 85 patients (73.3%) experienced improvement of GO symptoms in the first half-year, and only 4 of them (4.7%) suffered recurrence of the GO symptoms during the subsequent follow-ups. Orbital pain, tearing and extraocular muscle dysfunction had the best treatment reaction to IMRT, while proptosis and blurred vision were the most refractory symptoms. Acute complications were slight and self-limited, mainly including intermittent eye redness in 9 patients (7.8%), sideburns hair loss in 19 patients (16.4%), increased milphosis or madarosis in 23 patients (19.8%) and pseudo-progression of GO symptoms in 15 patients (12.9%). For long-term complications, chronic xerophthalmias occurred in 7 patients (6.03%), cataract developed in 2 patients (1.72%), and all were well-managed by medical interventions. Radiation retinopathy and secondary malignancy was not presented in the cohort., CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that IMRT could serve as a viable option in treating GO patients, with a satisfactory symptom control ability, and relatively slight and acceptable post-radiotherapeutic complications.",Excluded

Whole blood samples drawn from healthy donors, of either sex were irradiated in vitro at a dose of 1 cGy (adaptive or conditioning dose) Cobalt-60 gamma radiation (dose rate 1.12 cGy/min) at about 26 hr after mitogenic stimulation. After 31 hr of their initiation, groups of cultures were subsequently exposed to a challenging dose of 100 cGy gamma radiation (dose rate 82 cGy/min.). Eight males in the age group ranging from 25 to 55 years and eight females (age group 25 to 29 years), have been analysed during this study. Analysis of data revealed 40.6% reduction in the frequency of mn-BNCs among the males with a range from 25.7% to 54.7%. In case of females, also the per cent reduction varied from 26.3% to 49.0%, with a mean value of 33.7%. Pooling the data from males and females gave an overall reduction of 37.1% in the frequency of radiation induced mn-BNCs due to pre-exposure to 1 cGy radiation.",Included
744,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
2262,"p53 expression in human rectal tissue after radiotherapy: upregulation in normal mucosa versus functional loss in rectal carcinomas PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included
3198,"Microgeographic prediction of polygyny in the lark bunting Field experiments on breeding populations of lark buntings (Calamospiza melanocorys) in South Dakota support the hypothesis that polygyny is promoted by a high variance in quality among male territories. Among these birds protection of the nest site from solar radiation is the major indicator of quality: nestling survival was significantly correlated with nest-site cover, and experimental increase of shading resulted in higher reproductive success. Males with superior territories attracted two mates, whereas those with poor territories failed to attract any. Secondary females had fledging success at least equal to that of contemporaneous monogamous pairs. On the sole basis of a shading score for each territory, the mating status of males (polygynous, monogamous, or bachelor) was predicted accurately in new areas of Colorado and North Dakota before females arrived.",Excluded

AJRs with jaundice on the skin at about 7 days of age were intraperitoneally administered 1 ml/rat of normal rat serum every few days and irradiated with visible light for 14 hours a day in an irradiation box. This treatment allowed us to obtain mature AJRs. The treatment was effective when applied for short periods of 1-4 weeks of age. The frequency of maturation of the treated AJRs was about 27% and the best mating combination was a female ACJ and male AJR. The treatment of AJRs, made the progeny test for the selection of ACJs for breeding pairs of ACJ X ACR unnecessary and increased the frequency of appearance of AJRs to 50%.",Excluded
1770,"Femoral artery dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs (canis lupus familiaris) Background: In Veterinary Medicine, there are several methods for early and accurate assessment of blood flow dynamics. The Dopplerfluxometry can access the peak systolic velocity, mean velocity and end diastolic velocity, including Resistive Index and Pulsatility Index. Normal values of Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs allow the identification of vascular abnormalities and authors' knowledge there are no reference regarding the values of Dopplerfluxometry of the femoral artery in healthy dogs. The aim of the study was to assess the femoral Dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs by Resistive Index, Pulsatility Index, systolic and diastolic velocities, and femoral artery diameter. Materials, Methods & Results: Eighteen healthy intact beagle dogs, male and female, aging from 2 to 4 years old (mean +/- SD: mean 3 +/- 0.8 years), weighing from 10.1-17.9 kg [22.3-39.5 lb] [mean +/- SD: 14.3 +/- 2.7 kg (31.5 +/- 5.96 lb)] were used. The dogs underwent to physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry examination urinalysis, and radiographs examination, muscular and cardiac evaluation. Females had to be in anestrous. All dogs were submitted to right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry. The dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency by one person without any chemical restraint. A high definition ultrasound device equipped with a 3 - 13 MHz multi-frequency linear transducer was used. The right femoral artery was identified with the transducer positioned transversely on the right triangle femoral area. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity was measured. The Resistivity Index and Pulsatility Index were calculated automatically by the ultrasound machine software. Three measurements were obtained with the Doppler spectrum. The values of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, Resistivity Index, Pulsatility Index and femoral artery diameter were expressed as Mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD). Discussion(s): No studies regarding to femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs were found in the literature. These results can be used as normal reference values of Dopplerfluxometric parameters for adult dogs. The literature cited only Dopplerfluxometric values of renal arteries, abdominal aorta and of the internal thoracic artery. The normal values of arterial Dopplerfluxometry is necessary to identify the spectral quantitative characteristics of the blood flow for diagnosis and prognosis of vascular diseases. Authors referred to changes in blood perfusion by Dopplerfluxometry examination, but no changes in B-mode ultrasonography. The femoral Resistivity Index values can be used to correlate the postoperative evolution in dogs submitted to femoral bone, hip and knee surgeries, since Dopplerfluxometry allows blood flow assessment in the femoral region muscles. Changes in the heart rate, blood pressure, stress, exercise, and diseases as hypotension, renal lesion, hepatic diseases, diabetes, hyperadrenocorticism can change the Dopplerfluxometric parameters. All dogs which used in this study were clinically healthy, and were used beagle dogs due to lowest variations within breed. Sedation was avoid due to possible changes in Dopplerfluxometric parameters since the use of sedation or tranquilization in animals is strongly discussed due to possible hemodynamic changes that may occur during the examination. In conclusion, the mean values of the right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in male and female adult healthy dogs is Resistivity Index (0.887); Pulsatility Index (1.599); peak systolic velocity (124.41 cm/s), end-diastolic velocity (14.12 cm/s), femoral artery diameter (3.9 mm).Copyright © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

2391,"Use of irradiated bone graft for impaction grafting in acetabular revision surgery: a review of fifty consecutive cases Impaction bone grafting is a useful technique in the armament of a revision hip surgeon. Traditionally fresh frozen allograft has been used for this technique. However there are concerns about the transmission of viral proteins and prions through this form of allograft. As a result irradiated bone graft has been favoured in some centres. There is no long term series describing the results of impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone. This paper reviews a consecutive series of 50 cases of acetabular revision surgery performed between 1995 and 2001 and followed up over a mean period of 45 months. The preoperative bone defect was graded by the Paprosky classification. There were 2 cases of type 1a, 9 type 2a, 15 type 2b, 7 type 2c, 10 type 3a and 7 type 3b. All cases were followed up clinically and radiologically. Case notes were reviewed for primary prosthesis, operative details and reason for revision. The radiographs were evaluated for signs of bone incorporation, remodelling, loosening and migration of the acetabular component. There were 5 cases of aseptic loosening at the end of the follow up period. One patient had recurrent dislocation and was revised. 20 cases (40%) showed changes suggestive of bone incorporation, while only 3 cases (6%) showed remodelling. Clinically a good or excellent outcome with absence of pain was achieved in 35 patients (70%). The results suggested that acetabular impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone graft is comparable to fresh frozen allograft. The low percentage of remodelling remains a concern and warrants further studies.",Excluded

The two conventional Western medical treatment was administered to all, including intravenous dripping of 2% lidocaine 20 mL, dexamethasone 5 mg, gentamycin 80,000 units, vitamin B(12) 5 mg, dissolved in saline 250 mL, and 5% sodium bicarbonate solution for gargling, but to the patients in the tested group, YHD was given additionally. The medication was started simultaneously all through the whole course of the radiotherapy. Patients were examined every day to observe and compare the degree, initiating time, and repairing time of their oral lesions; the dosage of radiation they received was recorded as well., RESULTS: The degree of mucomembranous reaction that appeared in most patients in the test group was of grade 1-2, while in the control group, it was grade 2-3. The average time for oral lesion of 1, 2, 3 grades to be initiated in the test group was 12.0+/-1.1, 11.0+/-1.3 and 10.0+/-0.8 days, respectively, after radiation started, which was later than that in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the average repairing time for the lesions of grades 1, 2, and 3 in the test group was 3.0+/-0.7, 10.0+/-1.3 and 19.0+/-0.8 days, which were shorter than those in the control group respectively (P<0.01). The radiation applied on the primary tumor of patients with oral lesion of grade 1-3 in the test group was 24.2+/-2.2, 42.0+/-2.6 and 58.0+/-1.6 Gy on the average, respectively, which were higher than that applied on patients in the control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: The Chinese herbal preparation YHD could alleviate oral mucomembranous reaction to radiation applied in patients with head-neck tumor.",Excluded

To assess whether nimustine (ACNU), a drug that can cross the blood brain barrier, combined with radiotherapy, improved the survival of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Clinical materials and methods. Between 1995 and 2005, we treated 63 immunocompetent PCNSL patients with combination therapy consisting of intra-arterial ACNU (100mg/m 2) and whole brain radiotherapy (36-50Gy). Their median age was 60 years (range 28-81). The median follow-up was 24 months. Findings. With this regimen we achieved a complete response rate of 75% (43 of 57 patients). Kaplan-Meier estimates for median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 26 and 39 months, respectively. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36-65%) and 32% (95% CI, 17-47%), respectively. By multivariate analysis, age (<60 vs. >=60 years) was the only statistically significant prognostic factor; the WBRT dose, sex, and number of tumors were not significant prognostic factors in this study. Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, 60% of patients experienced grade 3-4 leukopenia. Late neurotoxicity as a result of treatment was observed in 14 of 43 patients (34%) and higher age (>60) was associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity. Conclusion. The intra-arterial administration of ACNU combined with radiation therapy yielded a high response rate at acceptable toxicity levels in younger patients with PCNSL. However, late neurotoxicity was a serious complication in patients above 60 years of age. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
271,"Increased lung cancer risk due to residential radon in a pooled and extended analysis of studies in Germany Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes.

Forty patients with refractory DLBCL were treated with high-dose etoposide for stem cell mobilization. All patients were in progressive disease (PD) prior to mobilization and underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by APBSCT. Successful PBSC mobilization was achieved in all patients. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) showed a clinical response to high-dose etoposide. After APBSCT, 17 patients (42.5%) achieved CR. The 2-year progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rate were higher in patients responding to high-dose etoposide (64.1% and 77.7%) compared to those without response (11.8% and 11.8%; P < 0.001 for both). The response to high-dose etoposide mobilization therapy was an independent prognostic factor for CR achievement, PFS and OS after APBSCT.

2916,"Identification of the most important features of knee osteoarthritis structural progressors using machine learning methods Objectives: The aim was to identify the most important features of structural knee osteoarthritis (OA) progressors and classification using machine learning methods. Method(s): Participants, features and outcomes were from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Features were from baseline (1107), including articular knee tissues (135) assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). OA progressors were ascertained by four outcomes: cartilage volume loss in medial plateau at 48 and 96 months (Prop_CV_48M, 96M), Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 and medial joint space narrowing (JSN) 1 at 48 months. Six feature selection models were used to identify the common features in each outcome. Six classification methods were applied to measure the accuracy of the selected features in classifying the subjects into progressors and non-progressors. Classification of the best features was done using an automatic machine learning interface and the area under the curve (AUC). To prioritize the top five features, sparse partial least square (sPLS) method was used. Result(s): For the classification of the best common features in each outcome, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest AUC in Prop_CV_96M, KL and JSN (0.80, 0.88, 0.95), and Gradient Boosting Machine for Prop_CV_48M (0.70). sPLS showed the baseline top five features to predict knee OA progressors are the joint space width, mean cartilage thickness of the medial tibial plateau and sub-regions and JSN. Conclusion(s): In this comprehensive study using a large number of features (n = 1107) and MRI outcomes in addition to radiological outcomes, we identified the best features and classification methods for knee OA structural progressors.

258,"Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing.",Excluded

Higher doses of radiation have been associated with improved outcomes but may result in higher toxicities. Respiratory gated radiotherapy (RGRT) has the potential to reduce pulmonary toxicity but there are significant limitations and pitfalls to its use. The aim of this article is to (i) describe the RGRT technique currently employed at Nepean and Westmead Hospitals; (ii) discuss the practical issues of implementing such a program; (iii) present the results of our RGRT program and (iv) review the potential uncertainties in using this technique and the methods we have used to overcome these. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients who had a 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) scan was undertaken. Records from treatment planning systems were used to assess the prospective gating program. Result(s): Between September 2007 and June 2011, 53 patients at Nepean and 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a 4D-CT. Between April and August 2011, 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a prospective 4D-CT scan as treatment verification. Two of the 26 patients (7.7%) were found to have incomplete coverage of the planning target volume. Both patients underwent respiratory re-coaching, alleviating the need for replanning. Conclusion(s): RGRT may reduce doses to organs at risk with the potential for dose escalation. However its implementation requires significant staff training, treatment time and resources. Treatment verification with image guided radiation therapy are essential for safe delivery. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded

Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2. In this study, the reliability of the dose-response curve in estimating the absorbed dose was also validated for 2 and 4 Gy using OSL dosimeters. The data were fitted into the constructed curve. The result of the validation study showed that the obtained estimate for the absorbed exposure doses was close to the true exposure doses.",Included

537,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for low-risk early breast cancer in elderly women: Evidence from randomized trials Breast cancer is the most common cancer pathology in women in the Western world. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years and in the coming decades it is estimated that the number of elderly women affected reaches an important percentage. This aging of the cancer population, associated with its inherent comorbidities and aggravated by the lack of consensus about the most appropriate treatment, make it difficult to administer an effective postoperative treatment in elderly women with a low-risk profile. An exhaustive geriatric evaluation is a sine qua non condition to opt for a specific type of treatment. To date, several options are available such as endocrine therapy (ET) alone, moderate/high hypofractionation and various accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques. In this article, we provide information about each of them. Copyright © 2020 Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1230,"Ability of a chest X-ray and an abdominal computed tomography scan to identify traumatic thoracic injury OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to show that a chest X-ray (CXR) and an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan are sufficient to identify most clinically significant thoracic injuries in trauma patients, rendering the thoracic CT scan useful in only a subset of patients., METHODS: A retrospective study identified thoracic injuries in 374 trauma patients evaluated with a CXR, a thoracic CT scan, and an abdominal CT scan. Injuries seen on the initial CXR versus those seen on a CT scan only (occult) were identified and assessed for clinical relevance., RESULTS: An abdominal CT scan identified 65% (15/23) of occult pneumothoraces, 100% (25/25) of occult hemothoraces, 64% (18/28) of occult pulmonary contusions, and 58% (18/31) of occult rib fractures. No occult pneumothoraces seen on the thoracic CT scan alone required tube thoracostomy., CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study suggests that a CXR and an abdominal CT scan will identify most occult intrathoracic injuries. Reserving a thoracic CT scan for patients with an abnormal CXR or high-risk mechanism could safely reduce cost and radiation exposure while still diagnosing significant thoracic injuries.

438,"Hippocampal avoidance with volumetric modulated arc therapy in melanoma brain metastases - the first Australian experience PURPOSE: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can deliver intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) like dose distributions in a short time; this allows the expansion of IMRT treatments to palliative situations like brain metastases (BMs). VMAT can deliver whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to achieve stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for BMs. This study is an audit of our experience in the treatment of brain metastases with VMAT in our institution., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastases were volumetrically contoured on fused diagnostic gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI/planning CT images. Risk organs included hippocampus, optic nerve, optic chiasm, eye, and brain stem. The hippocampi were contoured manually as one paired organ with assistance from a neuroradiologist. WBRT and SIB were integrated into a single plan., RESULTS: Thirty patients with 73 BMs were treated between March 2010 and February 2012 with VMAT. Mean follow up time was 3.5 months. For 26 patients, BMs arose from primary melanoma and for the remaining four patients from non-small cell lung cancer (n= 2), primary breast cancer, and sarcoma. Mean age was 60 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Five patients were treated without hippocampal avoidance (HA) intent. The median WBRT dose was 31 Gy with a median SIB dose for BMs of 50 Gy, given over a median of 15 fractions. Mean values for BMs were as follows: GTV = 6.9 cc, PTV = 13.3 cc, conformity index = 8.6, homogeneity index = 1.06. Mean and maximum hippocampus dose was 20.4 Gy, and 32.4 Gy, respectively, in patients treated with HA intent. Mean VMAT treatment time from beam on to beam off for one fraction was 3.43 minutes, which compared to WBRT time of 1.3 minutes. Twenty out of 25 assessable lesions at the time of analysis were controlled. Treatment was well tolerated; grade 4 toxicity was reported in one patient. The median overall survival was 9.40 months, CONCLUSIONS: VMAT for BMs is feasible, safe and associated with a similar survival times and toxicities to conventional SRT+/-WBRT. The advantage of VMAT is that WBRT and SRT can be delivered at the same time on one machine.",Excluded
3348,"Patterns of failure and clinical outcomes of post-operative buccal mucosa cancers treated with adjuvant ipsilateral radiotherapy Purpose: Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in buccal mucosa cancers is guided by histopathological factors. The decision to treat ipsilateral or bilateral draining lymph node is on physician discretion and guidelines do not have a defined indication regarding this. We aimed to analyze the failure patterns and survival in buccal mucosa cancers treated with adjuvant ipsilateral RT. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred sixteen cases of post-operative buccal mucosa cancers-pT3 or more, node positive, close margins (1-5 mm), lymphovascular invasion positive, perineural invasion positive, depth of invasion >4 mm-treated with RT to primary and ipsilateral nodes from May 2013 to May 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were treated to a dose of 60-66 Gy (44 Gy in the first phase and a coned down boost of 16-22 Gy in the second phase) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy on a linear accelerator. Primary end point was to assess control rates and secondary end point was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) out-comes. Result(s): Median age was 46 years with male; female ratio of 110:6. The edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage distributions were I (3.4%), II (34.4%), III (24.1%), and IV (37.9%). At a median follow-up of 22 months, crude rates of local failure, regional failure, and contralateral neck failure were 9.4%, 10.3%, and 3.4%, respectively. The 2-year contralateral neck control rate was 94.9%. Pathological positive node portended poorer OS (86.6% vs. 68.6%; p = 0.015) and DFS (86.5% vs. 74.9%; p = 0.01). Conclusion(s): Incidence of contralateral recurrence with ipsilateral irradiation in buccal mucosa cancers is low with descent survival outcomes, particularly in node negative cases.Copyright © 2020 The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
1002,"The value of the initial post-EVAR computed tomography angiography scan in predicting future secondary procedures using the Powerlink stent graft Objective: Current long-term surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at scheduled, lifelong intervals. The cancer and nephrotoxicity risks of interval CT scanning and prolonged radiation exposure are concerning. We sought to determine if surveillance CT angiography (CTA) can be safely reduced. Method(s): From July 2000 to November 2007, 345 patients were enrolled in U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials of the Powerlink System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif). An independent core laboratory analyzed 1519 post-EVAR CT scans (N = 1519) to 5 years to evaluate aneurysm size, migration, presence of endoleak, and evidence of graft obstruction. Analyses were conducted to determine the value of the initial CTA scan in predicting future secondary procedures in enrolled patients. Result(s): At any time during follow-up, CTA identified endoleak in 123 patients (36%), with 95% of endoleaks being type II. In addition, 49 patients underwent 72 secondary procedures at a mean of 22 +/- 21 months (range, 2-2007 days) after initial EVAR. These were based on clinical identification of limb ischemia in 13 interventions (18%) or core laboratory identification of abnormal CT finding in 58 interventions (81%). Of the 58 core laboratory identified findings, the inciting abnormality was present on the initial postoperative scan in 49 (84%). Of the remaining nine CT-driven procedures, three (5.2%) were due to late sac expansion attributed to type II endoleak (n= 2) or endotension (n= 1); two (3.4%) were for prophylactic reasons in the absence of endoleak; and four (6.8%) were in patients with type II endoleak not observed by the core laboratory and without sac expansion. The negative predictive value of the initial postoperative CTA for the need for a secondary procedure is therefore 96.4%, which can be improved to 97.6% with duplex ultrasound surveillance to detect sac expansion. Thus, a negative initial postoperative CTA is highly predictive of long-term freedom from secondary intervention. Conclusion(s): Among enrolled patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR, most abnormalities that result in a secondary procedure are detected on the initial postoperative CTA or present with clinical symptoms. Long-term surveillance CTA may therefore be replaced by duplex ultrasound imaging if the initial postoperative CTA shows no abnormalities.

708,"Uranium in drinking water: Renal effects of long-term ingestion by an aboriginal community The authors conducted a study of an aboriginal community to determine if kidney func-tion had been affected by the chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water from the community's drilled wells. Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480). This study indicates that at the observed levels of uranium intake, chemical toxicity would be a greater health concern than would radiation dose. © 2009 Heldref Publications.",Included
2736,"The evaluation of different radiological measurement parameters of the degree of collapse of the vertebral body in vertebral compression fractures For compression fracture, vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and kyphotic angle (KA) are two important imaging parameters for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment. This study used previous measurement methods to assess the degree of VBHL and KA, compare and examine differences between various measurement methods, and examine the correlation between relevant measurement parameters and intravertebral cleft (IVC) in the vertebral body. The radiographic images (lateral view of the T-L spine) of 18 patients with a single-level vertebral compression fracture were reviewed. We measured 9 characteristic lengths and angles on plain radiographs, including anterior vertebral height (AVH) and AVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, middle vertebral height (MVH) and MVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, posterior vertebral height (PVH), and vertebral body width, and assessed 6 parameters, including vertebral compression ratio (VBCR), percentage of anterior height compression (PAHC), percentage of middle height compression (PMHC), kyphotic angle (KA), calculated kyphotic angle (CKA), and IVC. The results showed that VBCR is a simple and rapid method of VBHL assessment, but it may result in an underestimation of the degree of VBHL compared to PAHC. When PMHC < 40% or kyphotic angle > 15degree, the probability of IVC occurring on the vertebral body was higher which means the higher risk of vertebral body instability. The results of this study could provide a reference for surgeons when using imaging modalities to assess the degree of vertebral body collapse.Copyright © 2019 Wei-En Hsu et al.

1524,"Head and neck angiography at 70 kVp with a third-generation dual-source CT system in patients: comparison with 100 kVp Purpose: This study was conducted in order to evaluate the image quality of 70 kVp and 25 mL contrast medium (CM) volume for head and neck computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and assess the diagnostic accuracy for arterial stenosis. Method(s): Fifty patients were prospectively divided into two groups randomly: group A (n = 25), 70 kVp with 25 mL CM, and group B (n = 25), 100 kVp with 40 mL CM. CT attenuation values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries were measured for objective image quality. Subjective image quality of the shoulder and cerebral arteries was also evaluated. For patients undergoing digital subtracted angiography (DSA), diagnostic accuracy of CTA was assessed with DSA as reference standard. Result(s): The SNRs of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). The CNRs of the shoulder and neck arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in subjective image quality of arteries between group A and group B (P > 0.05). The accuracy was noted as 94.0% (156/166) in group A and 97.1% (134/138) in group B for >= 50% stenosis. The accuracy of intracranial arterial stenosis was lower than that of extracranial arterial stenosis in group A. The radiation dose of group A was significantly decreased by 56% than that of group B. Conclusion(s): Head and neck CTA at 70 kVp using 25 mL CM can obtain diagnostic image quality with lower radiation dose while maintaining high accuracy in detecting the arterial stenosis compared with the 100-kVp and 40-mL CM.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Excluded
2895,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
2394,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded
1626,"Capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces: A cross-sectional survey Background Establishment of a hierarchical medical system is one of the major tasks outlined in China's ambitious health reform, and the ultimate success of this system depends on the treatment capacity of primary hospitals. Among the priorities of primary hospitals is the provision of quality services for chronic diseases, including diabetes, atypical and epidemic chronic disease in China. We aimed to estimate the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in China using qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we interviewed 24 related experts (five primary hospital principals, six general practitioner, five drug experts, five medical device experts, two clinical experts, and one health system expert) to establish the capacity standard of primary hospital for diabetes treatment in the hierarchical medical system. Next, we surveyed the treatment capacity with regards to human resources, drug supply, and medical equipment in 28 primary hospitals (17 urban and 11 rural) in six provinces in China (Shanghai, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou) between May 20 and July 12, 2016. Finally, we compared the survey results against the standard. We adopted purposive sampling, and used chi2 test and rank sum test for data analyses. Ethics approval was granted by Sichuan University, and all participants provided oral informed consent. Findings The primary hospitals surveyed had a mean of 1.76 general practitioners (SD 2.03) per million residents. The mean number of general practitioners per million residents was 1.48 (1.18) for rural hospitals and 1.92 (2.41) for urban hospitals, which were lower than the standard (2-3, based on the expert interviews and policy review). 11 (65%) urban primary hospitals provided three or more types of drugs, compared with four (36%) rural primary hospitals. Urban primary hospitals had a mean of 8.35 (SD 4.44) types of diabetes drugs and rural ones had 4.45 (3.33), although expert interviews and policy reviews indicated that primary hospitals need provide seven types of drugs that are often used in the clinic. 27 (96%) primary hospitals provided metformin, 26 (93%) sulfonylureas, 18 (64%) alphaglucosidase inhibitors, 16 (57%) insulin, 15 (54%) hypoglycaemic proprietary Chinese medicine, 11 (39%) glinides, and nine (32%) thiazolidinediones; newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists were scarcely supplied. All 28 primary hospitals were equipped with blood glucose meters, blood pressure instruments, and electrocardiograph machines; 25 (89%) had biochemical analysers, 27 (96%) B ultrasound machines, 20 (71%) colour Doppler ultrasound machines and x-ray machines, and eight (29%) fundus mirrors, while expert interviews showed that primary hospitals should have with all of these equipment. No significant difference in availability of medical equipment was recorded between rural and urban primary hospitals (p>0.05). Interpretation Primary hospitals in China, especially those in rural areas, do not have sufficient human resources and drugs for diabetes treatment, although they generally have adequate medical equipment. Strategies to enhance the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment need to increase the number of health-care workers and drug supply.",Excluded
345,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded
590,"Upregulation of VEGF and FGF2 in normal rat brain after experimental intraoperative radiation therapy The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 in the irradiated brain was examined to test how a single high dose radiation, similar to that used for intraoperative radiation therapy given to the normal cerebrum, can affect the vascular endothelium. After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included
2028,"Determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering A method was developed for the direct determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). The separation was carried out on a Cl8 column with the isocratic elution of the mixture of 20 mmol/L sodium acetate aqueous solution and methanol containing 0.22% trifluoroacetic acid (92: 8, v/ v). With the molecular recognition probe of pontamine sky blue, netilmicin formed an ion-association complex and enhanced the intensity of RRS. The RRS signal was detected by a commercial fluorescence detector at 365 nm of both excitation wavelength (lambdaem) and emission wavelength (lambdaex). Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for the netilmicin was 0. 7 mg/L. With the internal standard (IS) of tobramycin, a linear calibration curve ranged from 1. 2 mg/L to 30 mg/L was obtained. The presented method can be used for the pharmacokinetics study of netilmicin in rat serum, and can be a new choice for the determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics in biological samples.",Excluded

A total of 4995 sequential patients undergoing CCTA for suspected coronary artery disease were enrolled; 4862 patients (97.3%) had complete radiation data for analysis., INTERVENTION: A best-practice CCTA scan model was used, which included minimized scan range, heart rate reduction, electrocardiographic-gated tube current modulation, and reduced tube voltage in suitable patients., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included dose-length product and effective radiation dose from all phases of the CCTA scan. Secondary outcomes were image quality assessed by a 4-point scale (1 indicated excellent; 2, good; 3, adequate; and 4, nondiagnostic) and frequency of diagnostic-quality scans., RESULTS: Compared with the control period, patients' estimated median radiation dose in the follow-up period was reduced by 53.3% (dose-length product decreased from 1493 mGy x cm [interquartile range {IQR}, 855-1823 mGy x cm] to 697 mGy x cm [IQR, 407-1163 mGy x cm]; P < .001) and effective dose from 21 mSv (IQR, 12-26 mSv) to 10 mSv (IQR, 6-16 mSv) (P < .001). The greatest reduction in dose occurred at low-volume sites. There were no significant changes in median image quality assessment during the control period compared with the follow-up period (median image quality of 2 [images rated as good] vs median image quality of 2; P = .13) or frequency of diagnostic-quality scans (554/620 patients [89%] vs 769/835 patients [92%]; P = .07)., CONCLUSION: Consistent application of currently available dose-reduction techniques was associated with a marked reduction in estimated radiation doses in a statewide CCTA registry, without impairment of image quality., TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00640068.",Excluded

The extent to which host characteristics, including pigmentary phenotype and UV radiation exposure, contribute is unknown., Objective: To identify and validate independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT, including those associated with the transplant and the host., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed a consecutive sample of alloHCT recipients from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (n = 872) and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (n = 147). Participants from the Mayo Clinic were randomly allocated (2:1) into discovery (n = 581) and validation (n = 291) cohorts. Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P <= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.

Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91). Harrell concordance statistics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for internal and external validation of the keratinocyte carcinoma risk model, respectively., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found validated independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT that are enriched with host- compared with transplant-associated risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",Excluded
2172,"Cumulative radiation dose incurred during the management of complex pleural space infection Background: Complex pleural space infections are commonly managed with antibiotics, pleural drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy, and surgery. These strategies often utilize radiographic imaging during management, however little data is available on cumulative radiation exposure received during inpatient management. We aimed to identify the type and quantity of radiographic studies along with the resultant radiation exposure during the management of complex pleural space infections. Method(s): Retrospective review of community network healthcare system from January 2015 to July 2018. Patients were identified through billing databases as receiving intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy and/or surgical intervention. Patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and inpatient radiographic imaging was collected to calculate cumulative effective dose. Result(s): A total of 566 patients were identified with 7275 total radiographic studies performed and a median cumulative effective dose of 16.9 (IQR 9.9-26.3) mSv. Multivariable linear regression analysis revealed computed tomography use was associated with increased cumulative dose, whereas increased age was associated with lower cumulative dose. Over 74% of patients received more than 10 mSv, with 7.4% receiving more than 40 mSv. Conclusion(s): The number of radiographic studies and overall cumulative effective dose in patients hospitalized for complex pleural space infection was high with the median cumulative effective dose > 5 times normal yearly exposure. Ionizing radiation and modern radiology techniques have revolutionized medical care, but are likely not without risk. Additional study is warranted to identify the frequency and imaging type needed during complex pleural space infection management, attempting to keep ionizing radiation exposure as low as reasonably possible.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
2142,"Outcomes of Radiotherapy for Osseous Echinococcosis of Meriones meridianus Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

The nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission electron microscopic scanning mansoni (FESEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). For the in vitro test with Schistosoma mansoni, the DNHK-loaded PLGA was diluted into the medium, and added at concentrations 10-200 microM to the culture medium containing one adult worm pair. The parasites were kept for 120 h and monitored every 24 h to evaluate their general condition, including: pairing, alterations in motor activity and mortality., RESULTS: The loaded PLGA nanoparticles gave an encapsulation efficiency of 42.2% and showed spherical characteristics in monodisperse polymeric matrix. The adult worm pairs were separated after 120 h of incubation for concentrations higher than 50 microM of DNHK-loaded PLGA. The groups incubated with 150 and 200 microM of DNHK-loaded PLGA for 24 and 120 h killed 100% of adult worms, afforded LC50 values of 137.0 +/- 2.12 microM and 79.01 +/- 1.90 microM, respectively, which was similar to the effect displayed by 10 microM of praziquantel., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of DNHK-loaded showed schistosomicidal activity and allowed its sustained release. The loaded PLGA system can be administered intravenously, as well as it may be internalized by endocytosis by the target organisms.",Excluded

3015,"Safety and Feasibility of Performing Fenestrated Endovascular Abdominal Aneurysm Repair Using a Portable C-arm Without Fusion Technology: A Single-Center Experience Objective Most centers performing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) use hybrid rooms with fusion technology for mapping. We present our experience of successfully performing F-EVAR using C-arm without fusion technology. Methods During the period of January 2016 to October 2018, data were collected from a prospectively maintained F-EVAR database at our tertiary care institute. The primary endpoint was technical success, and the secondary outcomes measured were short- and midterm clinical success (both defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards), blood loss, radiation dose, operative time, postoperative endoleaks, aneurysm rupture, endograft patency, and complications. Results We performed 11 F-EVARs during the study period in five (45.5%) males and six (54.5%) females, with a mean age of 75+8 years. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C-arm (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) without the use of fusion technology. Three patients had planned preoperative open procedures for access due to prior cutdown or bypass. Technical success was achieved in all 11 (100%) cases. The mean length of stay was 5+2 days, and the mean follow-up was 7.5+6.5 months. The mean procedure time was 301+167 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 361+233 mL. Mean fluoroscopy time was 72+31 minutes, and the mean radiation exposure time was 2,160+930 mGy. No patients required intraoperative transfusion. Thirty-day (short term) clinical success was achieved in 10 (90.0%), cases whereas six-month (midterm) clinical success was achieved in 7 (77.7%) patients. Branch vessel patency was 11 (100%) at 30 days and 9 (81.8%) at six months, and primary endograft patency was 100% (11) at six months. We had no perioperative mortality or major adverse cardiac event at 30 days. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity included readmission for pulmonary edema from cardiac failure in one patient. Two patients had clinically insignificant silent cardiac enzyme elevation. Three patients had re-interventions performed during the mean follow-up period. Two patients developed renal stent thrombosis resulting in renal insufficiency, which is defined as an increase in creatinine concentration >=0.5 mg/dL, without the need for dialysis. One type II endoleak was identified postoperatively that required trans-lumbar embolization. No type I or III endoleaks were identified during the study period. Asymptomatic common femoral artery thrombosis was seen on follow-up imaging in one patient. Conclusions We conclude that F-EVAR can be safely performed using C-arm without the use of fusion technology. Its utility can be expanded to centers with appropriate skill set but no hybrid technology. Copyright © 2020, Juneja et al.",Excluded
306,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded
1359,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included

For the Space Shuttle, a system was needed to measure the mass of individual urine voids and to collect a sample of each void. In addition, the system had to be compatable with male and female crewmembers. Finally, the system had to operate with minimal crew effort.

Operative risks may be increased, but this has not been systematically addressed in published trials or reports. Method(s): This was a prospective, nonrandomized, restricted cohort design of patients (n = 200) from 1997 to 2003 with resectable cancer of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction. A total of 102 patients underwent multimodal therapy with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiation therapy before surgery, and 98 patients opted for surgery alone. In-hospital mortality and morbidity were the primary end points, and cancer survival was a secondary end point. Result(s): In patient cohorts matched for operative risk factors, the odds ratio for postoperative sepsis (P = .007), respiratory failure (P = .009), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (P = .02) was increased in the multimodal group. There was no significant difference between groups comparing median and 1-, 2-, and 3-year survivals. Conclusion(s): Multimodal therapy was associated with increased respiratory and septic complications compared with a surgery-only cohort undergoing the equivalent surgery. Respiratory failure was in most cases idiopathic. The data suggest that efforts should be made to limit radiation lung exposure in multimodal regimens, and to understand and modulate the local and systemic effects of preoperative chemoradiation. © 2006 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.",Excluded
969,"Treatment of haemorrhagic radiation-induced proctopathy using small volume topical formalin instillation BACKGROUND: Between 2 and 5% of patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy develop chronic radiation proctopathy, occurring as a result of damage to the rectal mucosa during the treatment.

There have been no formal trials of treatment for haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy and a variety of methods are currently used., AIM: In a retrospective study of 20 patients treated at a single centre, we assessed the efficacy of small volume topical formalin instillation to control bleeding from radiation proctopathy., METHOD: Patients were treated by a single operator using 20 mL of a 5% solution of formalin instilled into the rectum via a flexible sigmoidoscope for 3 min. Patients were followed up for an average of 22.7 months (range: 2-69)., RESULTS: A single session of formalin treatment was effective in 13 of 20 (65%) patients and a further four (20%) patients responded to a second treatment. No complications of the treatment was identified., CONCLUSION: Small volume formalin instillation therapy appears to be safe and effective in the context of haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy.

3302,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included

The mean CAF was 39 +/- 1.0, range 30-46, for cells from normal subjects, compared to a mean of 245.6, range 101-506, for cells from hereditary RB patients (p < 10-6). Of fibroblast lines from eight patients with unilateral RB, four had a CAF comparable to that of lines from normal donors (< 60) and four had a high CAF (> 130), resembling that of hereditary forms; two of the latter four lines were from patients with familial or deletion 13 forms of RB. Furthermore, in two families, PHA-stimulated blood lymphocytes from RB patients, one bilateral and one unilateral, and from certain unaffected first-degree relatives after G2 phase X-irradiation had a high CAF (>= 110) compared to a CAF (>= 53) of cells from three normal donors sampled at the same time. These results were shown not to be related to differences in cell cycle progression or initial extent of chromatid damage. The results suggest that the high frequency of chromatid aberrations in the cells from hereditary RB patients results from a genetic deficiency in DNA repair.",Included
3420,"Radiosurgery with flattening-filter-free techniques in the treatment of brain metastases : Plan comparison and early clinical evaluation BACKGROUND: Radiosurgical treatment of brain metastases is well established in daily clinical routine. Utilization of flattening-filter-free beams (FFF) may allow for more rapid delivery of treatment doses and improve clinical comfort. Hence, we compared plan quality and efficiency of radiosurgery in FFF mode to FF techniques., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2014 and June 2015, 21 consecutive patients with 25 brain metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in FFF mode. Brain metastases received dose-fractionation schedules of 1 x 20 Gy or 1 x 18 Gy, delivered to the conformally enclosing 80 % isodose. Three patients with critically localized or large (>3 cm) brain metastases were treated with 6 x 5 Gy. Plan quality and efficiency were evaluated by analyzing conformity, dose gradients, dose to healthy brain tissue, treatment delivery time, and number of monitor units. FFF plans were compared to those using the FF method, and early clinical outcome and toxicity were assessed., RESULTS: FFF mode resulted in significant reductions in beam-on time (p < 0.001) and mean brain dose (p = 0.001) relative to FF-mode comparison plans. Furthermore, significant improvements in dose gradients and sharper dose falloffs were found for SRS in FFF mode (-1.1 %, -29.6 %; p <= 0.003), but conformity was slightly superior in SRS in FF mode (-1.3 %; p = 0.001). With a median follow-up time of 5.1 months, 6-month overall survival was 63.3 %. Local control was observed in 24 of 25 brain metastases (96 %)., CONCLUSION: SRS in FFF mode is time efficient and provides similar plan quality with the opportunity of slightly reduced dose exposure to healthy brain tissue when compared to SRS in FF mode. Clinical outcomes appear promising and show only modest treatment-related toxicity.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): All patients gave informed consent after the study details, including radiation exposure, were explained; institutional ethical committee approval was obtained. Nonsynchronized multi-detector row CT of the chest was performed in 66 consecutive patients (29 men, 37 women; mean age, 58 years +/- 15 [standard deviation]) who were suspected of having PE. ECG-synchronized cardiac multi-detector row CT was performed to assess cardiac function. Dimension ratios for the RV and left ventricle (LV) were measured on nonsynchronized transverse and angulated four-chamber views. Furthermore, the RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were measured on ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT scans. An independent samples t test was performed to compare the mean value of different groups. An analysis of variance post hoc test was performed to investigate whether the values of the variables varied between groups. Result(s): PE was detected in 29 of 66 patients. The location of PE was categorized as central (n = 17) or peripheral (n = 12). The RV/LV dimension ratio was larger on the four-chamber view (P = .002), and RV end-systolic volume was larger (P = .01) and ejection fraction was lower (P = .01) in patients with PE. The RV end-systolic volumes and RV/LV volume ratios, as assessed by using ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT, showed significant differences (P < .005) between patients with central PE and those with peripheral PE. However, the RV/LV dimensions on nonsynchronized images revealed no significant differences.

Most of the patients could be omitted for abdominal computed tomography (CT). Despite high sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT, in addition to high medical cost, there are risks from radiation exposure and adverse reaction from use of contrast media. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence of KUB injury on abdominal CT in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-one studies of abdominal CT performed during 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for KUB injury (categorized by AAST organ injury scale) by consensus of two experienced radiologists.

The cutoff point of microscopic hematuria at 20 cells/hpf has sensitivity 80% and specificity 46.15%. Conclusion(s): One-third of the patients have KUB injury but almost all of them could be conservatively managed. We proposed that the cutoff point of hematuria be equivalent to or greater than 20 cells/hpf to be one of the indicators for predicting KUB injury that needs radiological evaluation; but it should be carefully considered along with clinical information.Copyright © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

Method(s): A total of 116 patients evaluated between 2000 and 2018 received reirradiation for HGG (99 WHO grade IV, 17 WHO grade III). Median time to first progression after initial therapy was 10.6 months. Salvage therapies before reirradiation included surgery (31%) and systemic therapy (41%). Sixty-five patients (56%) received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as reirradiation. The median biologically effective dose (BED) was 47.25 Gy, and the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc for SRS and 95.0 cc for non-SRS treatments. Systemic therapy was given concurrently to 52% and adjuvantly to 74% of patients. Result(s): Median FFP was 4.9 months, and median OS was 11.0 months. Significant multivariable prognostic factors for FFP were performance status, time to initial progression, and BED; for OS they were age, time to initial progression, and PTV volume at recurrence. High-grade toxicity was correlated to PTV size at recurrence. Three-level prognostic scores were generated for FFP and OS, with cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.640 and 0.687, respectively.

1188,"Peritumoral inflammatory reaction in non-melanoma skin cancers - histological and immunohistochemical study Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most frequent types of cancer in white skin populations, all over the world. In the last 40 years, there was observed a rapid increase of their incidence, because of the UV radiations exposure and weather changes. Although its morbidity is a relatively modest one, the direct social costs of NMSCs are quite substantial due to a high incidence. Due to these reasons, numerous studies try to clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of NMSCs, to elaborate treatment and prevention measures. In the last years, a special attention was given to the relation between inflammation and skin cancer. In our study, we performed a histological and immunohistological evaluation of the inflammatory reaction on a number of 73 surgical exeresis pieces coming from the patients diagnosed with NMSCs. Of these, 21 were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 52 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). The peritumoral inflammatory reaction in NMSCs was an extremely variable one in intensity and distribution, from one case to another and even from one area to another within the same tumor, thus proving the complexity of the relations between tumor cells and the cells of the immune system. By comparing the intensity of the inflammatory reaction between the two main types of NMSCs, there was observed that in SCCs the inflammatory reaction was more intense in comparison to BCCs. Also, in SCC there was highlighted a more abundant inflammatory infiltrate in poorly differentiated carcinomas, in comparison to the well-differentiated ones. The presence of the immune system cells (T-lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells) among the tumoral cells, in a direct contact with these, makes us believe that between the two categories of cells there may appear mechanisms of intercellular communication, distinct from the mechanisms of paracrine signaling.",Excluded
3345,"Antegrade wire escalation for chronic total occlusions in coronary arteries: Simple algorithms as a key to success Aims: Antegrade wire escalation (AWE) remains the method of choice for tackling chronic total occlusions (CTOs), especially for lesions with low J-CTO score. To increase the number of operators which treat CTOs and increase AWE success rates, there is a need for a clear, algorithmic approach. We report the results of a simple AWE algorithm with new guidewire technology in coronary CTOs. Method(s): Hundred consecutive CTO lesions selected for AWE as the primary strategy were included in five Benelux centers. The algorithm follows a step-wise increase in guidewire tip load. Lesions were categorized according to the J-CTO score. Primary endpoint was successful guidewire crossing. Result(s): No differences in baseline demographics were present between successful and unsuccessful procedures. Overall, in 75% of the lesions AWE resulted in successful crossing. AWE success rates in easy, intermediate, difficult and very difficult CTOs were 83, 86, 71 and 43%, respectively. 46% could be crossed using a soft guidewire only. An additional success of 34 and 60% could be reached with an intermediate and stiff guidewire, respectively. Adding additional techniques resulted in 88% overall success. Procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses and use of contrast were within highly acceptable ranges (67+/-39min, 27+/-19min, 1.7+/-1.3 Gy, 264+/-123ml). Conclusion(s): The algorithm and new wire technologies led to high success rates. AWE as a standalone procedure is highly successful in J-CTO 0-1. Low- and intermediatevolume CTO operators should try to implement a systematic approach in their CTO procedures, especially for lesions with low J-CTO scores. Adding additional techniques further increases these success rates.© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Many patients require invasive procedures such as parenteral nutrition or the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to ensure sufficient calorie intake during and after the course of treatment. Patients and Methods: We have considered 71 patients who, from Jan 2014 until Oct 2015 and in association with their course of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy of the head, neck, or thoracic region, received a PEG via standard endoscopic or reverse (so called PEXACT) procedure. Diagnoses and accordingly therapy regimens varied: Patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (n=34), Cetuximab-based immune-radiotherapy (n=11) or definitive radiotherapy (n=7) for HNSCC were most common, followed by spinal bone metastases (n=6) and thoracic esophageal carcinoma (n=4) among others. HNSCC patients received a mean cumulative dose of 55,6 Gy (stdev=4,4Gy) to the cervical lymph nodes with involved regions being boosted up to a mean cumulative dose of 69,2 Gy (stdev=4,9Gy). Concomitant Chemotherapy was applied in the form of either a median of 4 weekly courses of Cisplatin or two courses of Carboplatin/5-FU in week 1 and 5 of radiotherapy. A median of 6 weekly courses of Cetuximab was applied. We retrospectively analyzed the development of patient body weight, BMI and general performance during radiotherapy. Result(s): Mean initial BMI was 23,5 (stdev=4,7). PEG placement was performed after a mean period of 18 days into radiotherapy. Mean cumulative dose applied up to that point was 32,6 Gy accounting for 50,7% of the overall dose. Median weight loss before PEG placement was 1 kg (range 0-9kg). 70% of patients (n=48) consequently were able to stabilize their body weight within a range of +/-2 kg, 23% (n=16) continued to lose weight (mean of 4kg), 7% (n=5) gained weight. PEG-related CTCAE grade 3 or higher complications, none fatal, were observed in 3 cases in the form of PEG dislocation and severe infection with subsequent surgical intervention. Mild local infection was observed in 6 cases and treated antibiotically without further complications. Conclusion(s): PEG is a valid and important supportive procedure to ensure sufficient calorie intake during the course of craniocervical or thoracic irradiation and can help avoid weight loss and consequently poor patient performance. The requirement of a PEG is generally associated with high doses applied to the mucosa of the upper GI-tract. It is crucial to determine valid prognostic factors for PEG-requirement in addition to the best timing of PEG placement during radiotherapy. Further clinical analyses are underway, for which this data will serve as basis.",Excluded
2655,"Ultrasonic backscatter difference measurements of cancellous bone from the human femur: Relation to bone mineral density and microstructure Ultrasonic backscatter techniques are being developed to detect changes in cancellous bone caused by osteoporosis. One technique, called the backscatter difference technique, measures the power difference between two portions of a backscatter signal. The goal of the present study is to investigate how bone mineral density (BMD) and the microstructure of human cancellous bone influence four backscatter difference parameters: the normalized mean of the backscatter difference (nMBD) spectrum, the normalized slope of the backscatter difference spectrum, the normalized intercept of the backscatter difference spectrum, and the normalized backscatter amplitude ratio (nBAR). Ultrasonic measurements were performed with a 3.5MHz broadband transducer on 54 specimens of human cancellous bone from the proximal femur. Volumetric BMD and the microstructural characteristics of the specimens were measured using x-ray micro-computed tomography. Of the four ultrasonic parameters studied, nMBD and nBAR demonstrated the strongest univariate correlations with density and microstructure. Multivariate analyses indicated that nMBD and nBAR depended on trabecular separation and possibly other microstructural characteristics of the specimens independently of BMD. These findings suggest that nMBD and nBAR may be sensitive to changes in the density and microstructure of bone caused by osteoporosis.",Excluded
288,"Patient effective radiation dose and associated risk from transmission scans using 153Gd line sources in cardiac SPECT studies The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of transmission measurements acquisition to total patient effective dose from cardiac SPECT studies. A dual-head L-shaped gamma camera equipped with a transmission scan acquisition system based on two 153Gd line sources was used to simulate transmission measurements acquisition exposure on an anthropomorphic phantom. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to directly monitor the dose to 550 measuring points in the phantom. The effective dose and associated risk from transmission scans acquisition were estimated and compared to those associated to the radiopharmaceutical injected. The maximum effective dose from a typical transmission measurements acquisition was 1.3 muSv and 1.9 muSv for male and female patients, respectively. The contribution of the typical transmission scans acquisition to total patient radiation risk from a cardiac SPECT study is less than 10-3. Thus, radiation exposure may not be considered as a limiting factor for the clinical application of attenuation correction methods based on transmission measurements in cardiac SPECT.",Excluded
1131,"Cancer incidence among Danish Thorotrast-exposed patients BACKGROUND: Studies of groups of patients given injections of the alpha-emitting x-ray contrast medium Thorotrast may provide information on human alpha-ray carcinogenesis., PURPOSE: We re-established a formerly identified cohort of neurological patients receiving injections of Thorotrast for cerebral arteriography and assessed their incidence of cancer., METHODS: Using the national population register, the Danish Cancer Registry, and other registers, we determined the incidence of cancer among Thorotrast-injected patients. Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites., RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed. Cancer risk was increased at most other sites, although this increase was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: Alpha radiation may account for the increased risk of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma, whereas confounding factors most probably contribute to the increased risks at other sites.",Excluded

Total body water was determined with an isotope dilution technique using tritiated water as a tracer. Total body potassium was determined by counting the gamma radiation from the naturally present nuclid 40K in a total body counter. The results were compared with 'normal values' produced by multiple regression analysis of data from 476 healthy controls which had been published earlier from the same laboratory. The investigations showed no signs of water or potassium depletion in patients with continent ileostomies.,Excluded
1678,"[Local recurrence of rectal cancers. Multidimensional analysis by anatomoclinical factors and role of irradiation] Pre- or postoperative radiation therapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal carcinoma. Factors related to local recurrence were analyzed retrospectively by uni- and multivariate analysis. One hundred and fifty-five patients (mean age: 65 years) were operated on with curative intent between 1967 and 1984. Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

774,"Epidemiology and environmental risk in hairy cell leukemia Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an orphan subtype of leukaemia which constitutes less than 2% of all leukaemia's, with an incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 persons per annum. Median age at presentation is 55 years and it is 3-4 times more frequent in males. It is also more frequently encountered in whites and less in Asians, Africans and Arabs. The epidemiologic data are multi-factorial and influenced by ethnicity and geographical factors. Other reported associations relate to some environmental exposures and possible occupational factors. Smoking appears to have an inverse correlation with the development of hairy cell leukaemia, while farming and exposure to pesticides, petroleum products, diesel and ionizing radiation have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk. National and international collaborative efforts are needed in order to undertake more extensive studies involving larger patient cohorts, aiming to determine the role of occupational and environmental risk factors in the development of this rare form of chronic leukaemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2577,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer: Surgery improves locoregional control while response based on FDG-PET/CT predicts survival Introduction: To retrospectively analyze the outcome of patients with esophageal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Method(s): A total of 41 patients received neoadjuvant intent chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. Most patients had a locally advanced disease (T3/4: 82%, N+: 83%, M0: 100%) and squamous cell carcinoma (83%). All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or mitomycin/5-fluorouracil. Median radiation dose was 50.4Gy in the 25 patients who proceeded to surgery and 57.4Gy in 16 patients who did not undergo surgery. FDG-PET/CT was used for treatment planning in 24 patients. A second FDG-PET/CT was available for response evaluation in 18 patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 16 months in all patients and 30 months in survivors. Radiotherapy was completed without interruptions >3 days in 90% of patients, and chemotherapy was carried out to >80% in 85% of patients. The 2-year locoregional control rate was 60%, distant control rate 54% and overall survival rate 50%. Hematological toxicity grade 3/4 was observed in 34%/10% of patients and non-hematological toxicity grade 3/4 in 46%/2% of patients. Perioperative 30-day mortality was 4%. Subgroup analyses revealed that surgery significantly improved locoregional control (74% vs. 39%, p= 0.034), but not the 2-year survival rate (54% vs. 43%, p= 0.246). In contrast, response based on FDG-PET/CT prior and after chemoradiation significantly predicted improved overall survival (2-year overall survival 61% vs. 40%, p= 0.048). Conclusion(s): Outcomes of our cohort were comparable to other series using similar treatments. Surgery significantly improved locoregional control but not survival. Response based on FDG-PET/CT predicted survival and might be used for treatment stratification.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
762,"Measurement of lung airways in three dimensions using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R(2) = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R(2) value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments). The feasibility for airway path analysis to areas of ventilation defect is also demonstrated.",Excluded
455,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included
2178,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012 In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included
1785,"The treatment of movement disorders using gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery GK radiosurgical thalamotomy is an effective and useful alternative to invasive radiofrequency techniques for patients at high surgical risk. The mechanical accuracy of the gamma unit combined with the anatomical accuracy of high-resolution MR imaging makes radiosurgical lesioning safe and precise. Higher radiosurgical doses are more effective than lower ones at eliminating or reducing tremor and are without complications. The results from radiosurgical pallidotomy have been disappointing compared to those of gamma thalamotomy. A 50% complication rate in the former (homonymous field cuts, hemipareses, and dysphagias) combined with a poor success rate has led us to re-evaluate the indications for this procedure in the face of the excellent results obtained from radiofrequency pallidotomy with physiological monitoring. Perhaps lowered radiosurgical prescription doses can improve the complication rate. Anatomically, there appears to be a different sensitivity of the pallidum to radiation than that of the thalamus. Age-related or anatomy-related susceptible blood supply to the area may lead to hypoxia after single-fraction radiosurgery in a nuclear complex known to be especially susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, varying levels of iron deposition within the pallidum may catalyze free radical formation in the elderly only to be further exacerbated by tissue hypoxia. Future experience with radiosurgical treatment of essential tremor, dystonias, and other movement disorders should parallel that of radiofrequency techniques.",Excluded

Irisin and vitamin D are also known for their roles in the musculoskeletal system. In this study, we examined the impact of vitamin D correction on circulating irisin in Saudi subjects. For this, vitamin D deficient subjects (<=50 nmol/l) were advised to receive adequate sunlight, eat vitamin D enriched foods and retain normal physical activity for correction/improvement in vitamin D status. Seventy-eight (30 male and 48 female) subjects, who responded to vitamin D intervention, were selected for further analyses. Anthropometry and routine biochemical assay were performed. Serum 25 (OH) D was analyzed using electrochemiluminiscence. Irisin levels were analyzed at baseline and after 12-month of intervention. Serum 25 (OH) D levels were significantly increased at post-intervention compared to baseline value (51.0+/-4.0 vs. 27.8+/-2.3 in males and 69.1+/-4.5 vs. 27.1+/-1.8 in females). With an increase in the levels of vitamin D adjusted for age and BMI, a corresponding increase in irisin level was observed in males (P=0.026) and to a lesser extent in females (P=0.093). Thus, vitamin D correction had a significant impact on irisin levels in male Saudi subjects but in females it failed to reach at significance. Further studies are needed in other ethnic population to better understand the influence of vitamin D on irisin regulation and secretion.Copyright © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

Method(s): Between December 2009 and January 2010, among 70 consecutive patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER who performed with 256-slice CT scanner, we included the patients with heart rate (HR) of <= 75 bpm and HR variation <= 10 bpm. Therefore, we included 24 patients obtaining with PGT (mean age, 58.8+/-16.2 years; 12 men and 12 women) and 24 patients obtaining with RGH (mean age, 57.2+/-14.5 years; 12 men and 12 women). Scan was obtained from apex to kidney level. For each of 15 segments indentified according to the American Heart association's segmental model, image quality was evaluated by a radiologist using a four point grading scale: grade 4, excellent and no motion artifacts; grade 3, good and minor stairstep or motion artifacts; grade 2, moderate and presenting artifacts but still diagnostic; and grade 1, poor and not diagnostic. For each scan, radiation dose and additional extracardiac findings were estimated. Diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated the 2 patients performed conventional angiography. The image quality results between PGT and RGH scans were compared using Mann-Whitney Test. Result(s): No statistically significant differences were evident between these two groups in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics. The difference of image quality between PGT and RGH scans was not statistically significant (p = 0.5843). The image quality was regarded as grade 4 for most segments in both PGT (96.7%, 348/360) and RGH scans (98.9%, 356/360). Mean effective radiation dose was 10.4+/-1.2 mSv in patients with PGT as compared to 23.0+/-4.6 mSv in patients with RGH. Additional extracardiac findings are 10 cases in patients with PGT including lung nodule, thyroid nodule. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-gated CTA by using the PGT is useful for patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER because it can reduce radiation dose to 54.8% while maintaining image quality and diagnostic accuracy in patients with HR less than 75 bpm, and evaluate the coronary arteries, aorta, pulmonary arteries, and entire intra-thoracic structures at the same time.",Excluded

Research indicates that general neurological and sensory differences exist between the sexes, such as those in laterality of amygdala activity, sensitivity and discrimination in vision processing, and neuronal cell death (apoptosis) pathways. In spaceflight, sex differences may include a higher incidence of entry and space motion sickness and of post-flight vestibular instability in female as opposed to male astronauts who flew on both short- and long-duration missions. Hearing and auditory function in crewmembers shows the expected hearing threshold differences between men and women, in which female astronauts exhibit better hearing thresholds. Longitudinal observations of hearing thresholds for crewmembers yield normal age-related decrements; however, no evidence of sex-related differences from spaceflight has been observed. The impact of sex and gender differences should be studied by making spaceflight accessible and flying more women into space. Only in this way will we know if increasingly longer-duration missions cause significantly different neurophysiological responses in men and women.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Gel ""Elophit"" is a complex substance containing chlorins E6 (0.5%), copper chlorophyllin (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (2%) (conformance certificate No. ROSS RU.IM; 25130 2322). Therapeutic effects are produced not only due to the chlorin E6 photodynamic (PDT) action but also due to the action of copper derivatives which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. The preparation easily penetrates into the skin and accumulates in inflammatory foci. Gel ""Elophit"" was put on skin lesions 40 min before PDT session. Before the session preparation remnants were removed off the skin with a mild alcohol solution. PDT was performed in 12 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form) (4 males, 8 females), 8 patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (5 males, 3 females). Controls were 24 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form), 20 patients with streptostaphylodermias. Age - 17-58 years old, disease duration from 1 week to 6 years. Patients from the control group received traditional therapy without PDT component. Device ""Soljaris"" with incorporated diodes in the range 660 mum, irradiation power 400 mW was used as a light source. Irradiation was done in a scan manner (70-270 J/cm2). Sessions - twice a week. Research results were assessed by changes in the clinical picture using biophometry techniques with laser therapeutic apparatus ""Milta F-8-01"" having an in-built biophotometer. These changes are shown in photomaterials. FS accumulation degree in the skin was determined with spectrometry (apparatus ""LESA-01-BIOSPEC""). Result(s): A complete rash regression after 4-8 PDT sessions (in 2 weeks - 1 month) was seen in 8 (66.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris, in 5 (62.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia; in the rest of patients a considerable clinical improvement was seen. No changes in clinical picture during PDT treatment was seen in 2 (16.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 1 (12.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia. In the controls one month later a clinical remission was seen in 10 (41.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 11 (55%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, no changes - in 7 (29.1%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 6 (30%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, in the rest of patients - a partial rash regression. A fluorescent examination has shown less FS fluorescence (by 60-75%) in the skin after irradiation what indicates a marked phodynamic effect with a considerable discharge of singlet oxygen. Clinical observations have been confirmed by the results of biophotometric examinations of skin lesions when one could see changes typical for decreased or resorpted inflammatory processes. Conclusion(s): Thus, as it has been shown by preliminary findings PDT with photosensitizer ""Elophit"" may be an effective technique for treating some dermatologic pathologies. Further researches are needed to study better effectiveness of PDT with gel ""Elophit"" application in dermatologic practice so as to determine indications and to develop optimal schemes for treatment.""",Excluded

Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome.

2054,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk BACKGROUND: DNA strand breaks pose the greatest threat to genomic stability. Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included

Result(s): 21/50 (4 males): pelvic girdle 27 mm wider than shoulder girdle (female phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 7degree towards head, theoretical risk of horizontal cup. Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded
1374,"Factors influencing patient reported cosmetic outcome: Results of the Young Boost Trial Purpose or Objective: The Young Boost trial (YBT), a multicenter RCT (NCT00212121), investigates whether a higher boost dose leads to a lower recurrence rate in young patients treated with breast conserving therapy. Cosmetic outcome is the secondary objective. The aim of the current analysis is to investigate the factors influencing the patients' opinion about cosmesis. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2004-2011, 2421 breast cancer patients <= 50 y rs w ere i ncluded i n T he Netherlands, France, and Germany. All patients were treated with lumpectomy, followed by 50 Gy whole breast irradiation. Patients were randomized to receive a standard 16 Gy (n=1211) or a high 26 Gy boost (n=1210) to the tumour bed. Cosmetic outcome data at 4 years of 807 patients were used for the current analysis according to the following two scoring systems: 1. BCCT.core: Digital photographs were analyzed using a software program to extract an overall cosmetic score: excellent, good, fair or poor. This score is based on symmetry, skin color and scar visibility. The 7 features of symmetry in the BCCT.core program are: nipple position (pBRA), level of lower breast contour (pLBC), level of nipple (pUNR), distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE), length of breast contour (pBCD), area of the breast (pBAD) and non-overlapping area between left and right breast (pBOD). 2. Patients' score using a validated patient's questionnaire about the breast appearance, including an overall score: very satisfied, satisfied, not dissatisfied, dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. First, we analyzed the 7 features of BCCT.core in a proportional odds model, to investigate which parameters were related to the patients' opinion about cosmesis. In addition, we analyzed whether firmness, presence of rib pain or quality of life (QoL) aspects (EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire) at 4 years were related to the patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome. Result(s): Of the 7 BCCT.core parameters, pBCE and pBCD were significantly related to patients' score at 4 years. Patients with any difference in firmness rated their cosmesis worse than patients without any difference, even when the objective score (i.e. BCCT.core) was similar. This effect was larger by increasing difference. Worse perception of cosmetic outcome was also independently related to lower global QoL, lower emotional functioning and higher scores in the depression scale. The presence of rib pain had no influence. Conclusion(s): The patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome was significantly related to objective parameters like distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE) and length of breast contour (pBCD), but also to subjective factors, i.e. severity of firmness, depressive feelings, global QoL and emotional functioning.",Excluded
906,"The characteristics of esophagogastric junction contractile index in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or functional heartburn OBJECTIVE: To study the role of esophagogastric junction contractile index (EGJ-CI) in evaluating the function of anti-reflux barrier, and in differentiating patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) from those with functional heartburn (FH)., METHODS: A total of 115 patients presenting heartburn were enrolled in the study from January 2012 to June 2015.All subjects had completed Gerd-Q questionnaire and undergone gastroscopy, 24-hour pH-impedance monitoring and esophageal high-resolution manometry. GERD patients were divided into as reflux esophagitis, acid-nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and weakly acid-NERD groups. Patients with normal esophageal mucosa, normal acid exposure and negative proton pump inhibitor test were enrolled in FH group. EGJ-CI (mmHg.cm) as well as EGJ rest pressure and 4s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4s) were measured., RESULTS: Among the 115 patients, 18 were reflux esophagitis [(49.0+/-18.9) years, M:F=10:8], 25 were acid-NERD [(48.7+/-14.4) years, M:F=13:12], 37 were weakly acid-NERD [(52.0+/-14.8) years, M:F=15:22] and 35 were FH [(53.6+/-14.8), M:F=8:27]. No differences of Gerd-Q scores were noticed between the four groups. (1)Negative correlations were demonstrated between EGJ-CI and esophageal acid exposure time (r=-0.283, P=0.002), EGJ-CI and acid reflux events (r=-0.233, P=0.012), EGJ-CI and weakly acid reflux events (r=-0.213, P=0.022), EGJ-CI and non-acid reflux events (r=-0.200, P=0.032). (2)The value of EGJ-CI was significantly higher in FH patients than in the three subgroups of GERD(all P<0.01). EGJ rest pressure of FH group was higher than that of acid-NERD (P<0.01). IRP 4s in acid-NERD group was lower than that of FH and weakly acid-NERD (P<0.05). (3)The area under curve (AUC) of EGJ-CI was higher than that of EGJ-CIT, EGJ rest pressure or IRP 4s(0.686 vs 0.678, 0.641 and 0.578). The cut-off value of EGJ-CI to differentiate GERD from FH was 9.74 mmHg.cm with sensitivity 82.86% and specificity 51.52%., CONCLUSIONS: The EGJ-CI values are negatively correlated with esophageal acid exposure time, weakly acid reflux events and non-acid reflux events. Thus it might be used as a metric to reflect the anti-reflux function of EGJ. According to the cut-off value of EGJ-CI 9.74 mmHg.cm, patients with GERD can be sensitively differentiated from patients with FH.",Excluded
177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly. The irradiation history may be germane in the human cases that arise.",Excluded
696,"A noninvasive objective measure of sunscreen use and reapplication OBJECTIVES: To study whether a noninvasive swabbing technique can detect sunscreen use for up to 6 hours, and whether the technique can detect reapplication of sunscreen., METHODS: Thirty volunteer office workers were randomly assigned to have one of a variety of sunscreens applied using recommended application techniques, and half were randomly assigned to have sunscreen reapplied after 3 hours. Alcohol-based swabs were used to obtain a sample from participants' arm at 20 minutes, and hourly from 1 to 6 hours post-application. Absorption readings were analyzed using an UV-visible spectrophotometer., RESULTS: The swabbing technique was consistently able to distinguish the sunscreen from control swabs for up to 6 hours. The absorption readings between 20 minutes and 6 hours were significantly higher than control swabs. There were no differences between the group that had sunscreen reapplied and the group that did not., CONCLUSION: The sunscreen swabbing technique is an effective noninvasive method for detecting a variety of sunscreen products in adults over a 6-hour period. No differences in absorption readings were found with sunscreen reapplication. This procedure will be a useful adjunct to other objective measures of sun protection and UV radiation exposure, resulting in a more accurate picture of the sun protection habits of individuals.",Excluded
1095,"Gamma teletherapy of inoperable retroperitoneal tumors with nonuniform distribution of the dosage in the tissues The clinical material is used to substantiate the advantage of the technic of uneven irradiation of patients with primary locally spread tumors of the retroperitoneal space, in whom all the routinely used methods of treatment proved to be infective. Uneven distribution of the dosage is provided by using a grid diaphragm and conducting gamma-therapy only from one static field during the whole course of irradiation. This pattern of radiotherapy is shown to increase radioresistance of normal tissues and allows 1.5--4 times large focal dose to be applied to tumor compared with gamma-therapy via moving lead strips, thus rendering an enhanced antitumor effect of radiation. These data are confirmed by the results of clinical observations over 30 patients with locally spread inoperable tumors of the retroperitoneal space.",Excluded
840,"Concomitant radiochemotherapy for locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer: tolerance and early results Combination of radio- and chemotherapy is one of the methods which may improve results of treatment in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Currently, the most promising sequence of radio- and chemotherapy is concomitant. In Head and Neck Cancer Department of Cancer Center in Warsaw since 1995 is continued study estimated tolerance and effectiveness of the concomitant radiochemotherapy for patients with locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer. Chemotherapy consist of cisplatinum and 5-fluorouracil in continuous infusion during first week of irradiation followed by 24-hours infusion of 5-fluorouracil one weekly until radiotherapy is finished. Radiotherapy is used with conventional fractionation 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly to total dose 66 Gy. Between October 1995 and September 1998 fifty seven patients with oropharyngeal cancer were entered to study. Tolerance of treatment was acceptable. Complete regression of the tumor was obtained in 41/57 patients (72%). Five other patients after radiotherapy were referred for successful radical neck dissection. Including this group, local control was obtained in 81%. At this moment, 60% of patients are alive without evidence of disease. In 12 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer tolerance of treatment and early results were poor, so the study was stopped in this group.",Excluded
3339,"High-tech facelift Recent technological advances in our specialty have made us reappraise the way we approach facial rejuvenation. Some of these technological interfaces have made it possible, in the author's experience, to improve results and to tackle difficult aesthetic problems. The purpose of this paper is to report how we combine these technological advances in an effort to improve the aesthetic outcomes. These technological advances are: laser skin resurfacing, endoscopy, newer fat grafting procedures, and new alloplastic materials for bone augmentation. Other technological advances are consultations via the Internet, computer imaging for simulation of possible outcomes, etc. Endoscopy is routinely used in our facial rejuvenative procedures, almost always for the forehead, often for the midface and less often for the neck. Fat grafting procedures using newly adapted concepts are used for the brow, glabella, tear trough deformity, cheeks, lips, chin, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, and other areas of soft tissue depressions apparent before or after the lifting procedures. This has allowed us to restore the tridimensional volume and treat the soft tissue atrophy. Patients with significant skeletal soft tissue disproportion due to aging, loss of dentition, prior trauma or congenital defects may receive one or more of the following implants: glabella, cheek, piriformis, angle of the mandible, mandibular body glove type of implant, prejawl implant, chin overlay or a glove type of implant. Our preference is for a porous polyethylene material because of its tissue ingrowth inductiveness. Individuals who have damaged skin due to solar exposure, aging, smoking, etc., may receive Ultrapulse CO2 laser resurfacing at the same operative setting (more often) or in a delayed fashion. The Versapulse laser is also needed for the treatment of some skin changes secondary to aging such as telangiectasias (Variable Pulse Green) and brown spots (Q-Switch 532). The high-tech facelift has allowed us to treat the severely damaged skin, fat atrophy, bone atrophy in many patients, at the same time that the lifting procedure is performed. This provides a more comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation. The combination of different techniques and technologies maximizes the effectiveness and minimizes the potential side effects of each one. Scars in the forehead and scalp are avoided. Incision and fat removal in the lower eyelid are often unnecessary. It provides a more precise vertical lifting with correction of the tear trough deformity and gives a tridimensional restoration of the facial volume. The facial disharmony is treated at every level starting from the facial skeletal support to the most external envelope (skin). Over 200 patients have been treated this way with a minimal rate of complications. The high-tech facial rejuvenation has allowed us to improve the surgical results of our patients compared with previous isolated techniques. The combination of each one of the techniques require a precise understanding of the limits and benefits of each. Case examples of the different combinations will be shown.",Excluded
597,"Association between radiation dose and pathological complete response after preoperative radiochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer Aim: This study was undertaken to examine the impact of radiation dose on pathological complete response (pCR) rates following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (N-RCT) for squamous cell esophageal cancer (ESCC). Patients and Methods: From 1988 to 2011, 218 patients were treated with 30-30.6 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction), 39.6-40 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) or 44-45 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) and concomitant cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin + 5-FU or 5-FU alone. The most commonly used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-FU-Alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day during the whole course of treatment (n=111). To eliminate the dispersing effect of potentially different efficacy levels of these drug regimens on pCR, we excluded patients with regimens other than 5-FU-Alone. Result(s): Histomorphological regression grade 1a (0% residual tumor), 1b (<10% residual tumor), 2 (10-50% residual tumor) and 3 (>50% residual tumor) was observed in 26 (23%), 24 (22%), 36 (32%) and 25 (23%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 9 out of 71 (13%) patients treated with 30 Gy-30.6 Gy, 13 of 34 (38%) patients treated with 39.6-40 Gy and 4 of 6 (67%) patients treated with 44-45 Gy (p=0.001). Median follow-up time from the start of N-RCT was 191 months (range=2-262 months). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 33% for the whole cohort. OS at 5 years was 58% for patients with pCR compared to 25% for patients with less favorable response to N-RCT (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion(s): The dose of radiation correlates significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR in stage II/III squamous cell esophageal cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are required to definitively evaluate the impact of application of higher radiation doses on efficacy and safety/tolerability in the context of N-RCT on the clinical outcomes.",Excluded
2853,"Low contrast and radiation dose coronary CT angiography using a 320-row system and a refined contrast injection and timing method BACKGROUND: Among CT scanners, 320-row instruments feature decreased photon energy and yield strong contrast enhancement. Consequently, the contrast medium (CM) dose can be reduced. The results of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on 320-row scanners have not been adequately assessed., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of a low-contrast-dose protocol on the image quality of CCTA using 80 kVp tube voltage, iterative reconstruction (IR), and a 320-row scanner., METHODS: We randomly assigned 90 patients (mean body weight, 56.5 +/- 11.0 kg) to 1 of 3 CCTA protocols. Under protocol A, 30 were scanned using a conventional 120-kVp protocol and a standard CM dose (280 mg iodine/kg body weight [mgI/kg]). Another 30 underwent scanning at 80 kVp with a 25% CM dose reduction (210 mgI/kg; protocol B). Under protocol C, the remaining 30 patients were scanned at 80 kVp with a 50% CM dose reduction (140 mgI/kg). The 120 and 80 kVp images were processed with IR. Images obtained under the 3 protocols were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis., RESULTS: The amount of CM used in protocol A, B, and C was 43.6 +/- 10.1, 30.3 +/- 4.4, and 21.0 +/- 4.0 mL, respectively. Mean CT attenuation of the coronary arteries tended to be higher under protocol B than the other 2 protocols. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher under protocol B. The mean visual scores were significantly higher for protocols A and B than protocol C. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under the 80-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: With a 320-row scanner and our refined CM injection and timing protocol, it is technically feasible to obtain sufficient vascular enhancement with a reduction in the CM and/or radiation dose at 80-kVp CCTA with IR.

METHOD(S): The experimental animals were whole-body exposed to microwave radiation with frequency of 2,450 MHz, power density of 1, 5, 15 mW/cm(2) respectively 1 h everyday for 30 days. Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05). The percentages of G(2) + M phase thymocytes in both radiation groups (12.24% +/- 1.82%, 11.19% +/- 1.36%) were lower than that in control group (14.58% +/- 0.64%) (P < 0.01).

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 187 patients diagnosed with proximal humerus fractures. X-ray images of all patients were analysed, and on this basis, bone quality was assessed, using the Deltoid Tuberosity Index (DTI), average cortical bone thickness (CBTavg) and the Tingart measurement. The type of fracture was classified according to Neer's and Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) classifications. Moreover, the caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle was measured and the relationships between valgus or varus fractures and the DTI, CBTAVG and Tingart parameters were investigated in all patients. RESULT(S): Using the Neer classification, the most common fracture type was type 3, found in 90 patients (48.1%). A total of 51 patients (27.3%) sustained an AO B1 fracture. Significantly lower mean DTI values were noted in patients with a Neer 4 fracture compared to those with Neer 3 (p = 0.02) and Neer 2 fractures (p = 0.03). Moreover, significantly higher mean DTI (p <0.00) and CBTAVG (p <0.025) values were noted in the group of patients with valgus fractures (CCD> 140). CONCLUSION(S): 1. In the group of patients diagnosed with a four-part fracture according to Neer, bone quality assessed using the Deltoid Tuberosity Index was significantly worse than in two- and three-part fractures. 2.

METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible.

948,"Point-of-care ultrasound for confirmation of gastrostomy tube replacement in the pediatric emergency department Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are frequently used in children for feeding and nutrition. Complications related to G-tubes (and G-buttons) in children represent a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). G-tube replacement is usually performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Misplacement may lead to tract disruption, perforation, fistula tract formation, or feeding into the peritoneum. Contrast-enhanced radiographs are traditionally used for confirmation. In addition to a longer length-of-stay, repeat ED visits result in repeated radiation exposure. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) instead of radiography avoids this exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we describe three patients who presented with G-tube complications in whom POCUS alone performed by pediatricians was used for confirmation of the tubes' replacement. Two children presented to the ED with G-tube dislodgement, and one child presented with a ruptured balloon. In all three cases, a new G-tube was replaced at the bedside using POCUS guidance without the need for further radiographic studies. There were no known ED or clinic returns for G-tube complaints over the next 30 days. This is the first report of pediatricians using POCUS to guide and confirm G-tube replacement in children. The success of these cases suggests the technique's feasibility. Future prospective studies are needed to evaluate the learning curves, diagnostic accuracy, ED length-of-stay, and use of confirmatory imaging.",Excluded

All patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy., SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral center., INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen patients had mandibular continuity restored by using the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system, and 1 patient received a stainless steel mandibular reconstruction plate. Associated soft-tissue defects were repaired by using radial forearm (n = 11), rectus abdominis (n = 2), scapular and parascapular (n = 1), or lateral arm (n = 1) free flaps., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early and delayed complications., RESULTS: All 15 microvascular free tissue transfers were successful. Early complications were minor and occurred in 5 (33%) of 15 patients. One patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction. Three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction. Patients who experienced delayed external plate exposure required secondary reconstruction with a vascularized bone-containing free flap. The overall rate of delayed reconstructive failure was 40% in patients who were followed up for a minimum of 1 year., CONCLUSIONS: For patients who are undergoing free flap reconstruction of lateral mandibulectomy defects, the technique that used soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates has been abandoned in favor of using vascularized bone-containing free flaps or a combination of free flaps to achieve optimal long-term results.",Excluded
1695,"Evaluation and definitive management of medically inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Part 2: newer treatment modalities Lung cancer is estimated to be the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in 2006, and the leading causes of cancer mortality. Non-small-cell lung cancer represents the majority of such cases. Most of these patients have locally advanced disease at presentation and are not eligible for curative resection. For the minority of patients who are technically resectable at presentation, lobectomy or pneumonectomy and pathologic mediastinal nodal staging offer the best overall survival. The high rate of comorbid medical illness and poor baseline pulmonary function in this population, however, make many such early-stage patients medically inoperable. For these patients, conventional single-modality radiotherapy has been the primary definitive treatment option, as discussed in part 1 of this article, which appeared in last month's issue. Numerous retrospective reports demonstrate long-term disease-free and overall survival data that are modestly superior to that expected after observation, but both local and distant failure continue to be significant risks. Investigation of radiotherapy dose escalation is ongoing, in an effort to improve local control while maintaining minimal toxicity. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that new modalities, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and radiofrequency ablation, may also be potentially curative treatment alternatives. These modalities are addressed in part 2.",Excluded
861,"Different trend for changing of mammalian plasma (serum) antioxidant activity after irradiation at large and low-doses One of the path for research of antioxidant status in vivo is the determination of blood plasma (serum) antioxidant activity (AOA). AOA is an integral parameter for the contribution of different antiradical defense components which particular nomenclature is determined by a used method of definition. In the present work AOA is studied with usage of a system of suppression in vitro by blood plasma (serum) of a Fe(2+)-induced oxidation of a substrate from egg yolk lipoproteins. The contribution of separate components of a blood plasma to an integral index of AOA for human blood serum is studied. Urine acid, albumin, reduced glutathione, ascorbat, heparin, peroxidase and catalase had no activity. Apo-beta-lipoprotein, vitamin E, ceruloplasmin and transferring are introduce, possibly, the main contribution to AOA. The significant decrease of AOA was revealed after acute irradiation by gamma-rays of dogs (4.05 Gy) and mice (6 Gy). The irradiation of mice at low-dose (0.2 Gy), vice-versa, result to stimulation of AOA with clear peak value on 5 day. The possible reasons of quality difference for effects of large and low dose radiation with reference to antioxidant system of organism are discussed.",Included
2208,"Diffraction enhanced imaging of articular cartilage and comparison with micro-computed tomography of the underlying bone structure The goal of this study was to explore the role of diffraction enhanced X-ray imaging (DEI) for assessing changes in osteoarthritic cartilage and correlating the findings with concurrent changes in the underlying bone imaged using micro-computed tomography (microCT). DEI was used to image femoral head specimens at various beam energies. DEI utilizes a monochromatic, highly collimated beam, with an analyzer crystal that selectively weights out photons according to the angle they have been deviated with respect to the original direction. This provides images of very high contrast, with the rejection of X-ray scatter. The underlying bone was imaged using microCT and measures quantifying the bone structure were derived. Confirmation of cartilage degeneration was obtained from histology and polarized light microscopy. DEI allowed the visualization of articular cartilage and reflected the fibrillations and fissures in tissues from degenerated joints. The trabecular bone underlying the most degenerated articular cartilage showed increased bone volume fraction and more plate-like characteristics, compared with that underlying normal appearing cartilage. The histology and polarized light microscopy images reflected the DEI based features of cartilage architecture. These data reflect the ability of X-ray based emerging technologies to depict cartilage-bone interactions in joint degeneration.",Excluded

Nutrition and pain were found to be the major problems, and as many as 19-40% reported psychiatric distress. Patients having received additional brachytherapy did not report any increase in QL problems (except for pain) compared with those having had external radiation only. Quality of life does not seem to be affected by the increased irradiation local dose given when brachytherapy is included in the treatment regimen.",Included
3072,"High pathological response rate in locally advanced esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant combined modality therapy: Dose finding of a weekly chemotherapy schedule with protracted venous infusion of 5-fluorouracil and dose escalation of cisplatin, docetaxel and concurrent radiotherapy Background: This phase I study was aimed at defining the toxicity profile and pathological response rate of a neoadjuvant schedule including weekly docetaxel and cisplatin, protracted venous infusion (PVI) of 5-FU and concomitant radiotherapy (RT) in locally advanced esophageal cancer. Patients and Methods: The schedule consisted of a first phase of chemotherapy alone and a second phase of concurrent chemoradiation. Initial doses were: docetaxel and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus 5-FU 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 29-49; RT (40 Gy) started on day 29. In the following steps the doses were escalated up to docetaxel 35 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57 plus 5-FU 180 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 29-63 concurrently with RT 50 Gy. Result(s): Forty-seven patients were enrolled and 46 completed the planned treatment. During the concomitant phase, grade 3-4 hematological toxicities occurred in three patients (6.5%) (or 3/174 cycles) and non-hematological toxicities in six patients (13%) (or 7/179 cycles). A pathological downstaging was obtained in 59.6% of the cases (28/47): complete remission (pCR) in 14 patients, near pCR (residual microfoci on the primary pN0) in eight patients, pT2 pN0 in three patients and partial response on the primary with positive lymph nodes in three patients. Six (13%) and 13 (28%) patients were considered stable and non-responders, respectively. In the last dose level, eight pCR and four near-pCR were obtained out of 15 patients. The maximum tolerable dose was not formally defined because dose escalation was stopped at the last dose level. Conclusion(s): This schedule represents a feasible treatment and the high pathological response rate is extremely encouraging; the doses found in the last dose-level are the basis for an ongoing phase II study at our institution. © 2005 European Society for Medical Oncology.",Excluded

453,"Utility of postoperative radiographs for cervical spine fusion: A comprehensive evaluation of operative technique, surgical indication, and duration since surgery STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE.: To assess the utility of postoperative radiographs in patients across a spectrum of cervical fusion procedures, surgical indication, and time since surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographs are routinely obtained after cervical spine fusion despite lack of evidence supporting such practice. Studies assessing postoperative radiographical utility in the cervical spine have been limited. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated the utility of obtaining such radiographs across multiple cervical fusion procedures. METHODS.: A total of 972 clinic notes from 301 patients during a 10-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in this study underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion, a combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and anterior corpectomy and fusion (hybrid), posterior spine fusion, or 360degree fusion. All postoperative clinic notes and radiographs were reviewed for abnormalities and changes in treatment course. It was determined whether an abnormal radiograph alone led to a change in treatment course among the various operative techniques, surgical indication, or time since surgery. RESULTS.: No statistical significant difference in radiograph utility between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (0 changes in treatment course due to radiograph alone out of 332 clinic notes), anterior corpectomy and fusion (0 of 140), hybrid procedure (1 of 72), posterior spine fusion (5 of 357), and 360degree fusion (0 of 71) was found. Surgical indication (trauma vs. degeneration) and duration from surgery yielded no statistical significant difference in radiograph utility. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of radiographs were 33.8%, 87.6%, 19.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION.: Regardless of operative techniques performed, surgical indication, and time since surgery, routine postoperative radiographs provide low utility in guiding treatment course in asymptomatic patients. Although radiographs may provide important diagnostic utility in certain individual cases, the results of this study provide further evidence that radiographs should not be considered routine during postoperative visits, thus minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure and medical costs.

We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015). The incidence of the composite including death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization was observed in 60 (28.7%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 44 (19.1%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.024).

Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded
924,"UV dose determines key characteristics of nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers worldwide. Although many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NMSC, UV radiation is an important risk factor. A fundamental question in skin cancer research is whether varying doses of total UV radiation influence key characteristics of NMSC. The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded
51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

606,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded
198,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included
1110,"Correlation between normal tissue complications and in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from radiotherapy patients treated for variety of tumors PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between fibroblast intrinsic radiosensitivity in vitro and late reactions of normal tissues in patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for variety of tumors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were selected for this study. They were treated by radical radiotherapy for variety of tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, glottic larynx, anal canal, cervix, bladder, thyroid gland, and tonsil pillar. Five patients did not develop any significant late reactions (normally sensitive group, NS). The other five developed late complications in different normal tissues and organs that proved to be fatal in one patient (clinically hyper-sensitive group, HS). Fibroblast cultures were established from punch skin biopsy and radiosensitivity in vitro was measured. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was calculated and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: SF2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.38 with a mean of 0.24. The mean SF2 for each of the NS and the HS groups were 0.31 and 0.17, respectively. The non-parametric rank test of Mann-Whitney shows that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts is correlated with late complications in different organs and normal tissues following radiotherapy for variety of tumors. It also lends support to the existence of a common genetic component determining the radiosensitivity of cells targeted by the late effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Is it possible to decrease the mAs by 50 % with the NIP system without significant loss of information?, MATERIALS AND METHODS: From each of the 20 animals, three lateral radiographs were acquired. The assessment of the exposure level was based on the generated lgM-values. Images were acquired 1. with the NIP system and exposure settings equivalent to an lgM of 1.9, 2. with the PIP system and identical settings, and 3. with the NIP system and 50 % of the mAs. Six blinded readers used a 5-step scale to assess the reproducibility of five anatomical structures and image noise sensation. Data were analysed using Visual Grading Characteristics Analysis (VGC)., RESULTS: While applying identical exposure values the NIP system for all features revealed superior ratings to those of the PIP system (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.81 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.92 for ""trachea""). Even when reducing mAs by 50 % in the NIP images all features were rated better compared with the PIP images and original settings (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.60 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.74 for ""trachea"" and ""caudal thoracic field"")., CONCLUSION: The NIP system demonstrates clearly better image quality compared to the reference PIP system. A dose reduction of 50 % seems to be possible without relevant detraction from image quality.

828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded
1119,"Breaking bad: Chromothripsis and malignancy in CNS tumors Chromothripsis is a relatively novel form of genomic instability reported in a wide range of neoplasms [1, 2] and refers to shattering of a chromosome or part of a chromosome with subsequent segmental gene rearrangements in large numbers. It is currently thought to represent a single catastrophic breakage event leading to additional tumorigenesis. This is in contradistinction to the more well-delineated forms of genomic instability characterized by incremental changes. The mechanism by which chromothripsis occurs is not well understood; ionizing radiation, telomere dysfunction, abortive apoptosis, replication stress, and mitotic compaction of incompletely replicated chromosomes have been posited as potential triggers [2]. Generally, chromothripsis is linked to poorer prognosis [1]. With increased availability of advanced cytogenomic molecular assays, and growing recognition of the importance of molecular and genomic classification particularly of central nervous system neoplasms, an ever-increasing amount of molecular data becomes available. Here we report on a group of CNS neoplasms (primary and metastatic) in which cytogenomic analysis revealed chromothripsis. This cohort consists of 9 cases identified over a 7-month period. All cases were considered high-grade malignant neoplasms. Six of the cases (67%) represented primary CNS neoplasms consisting of glioblastoma (4), anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma (1), and an atypical meningioma (1). The remaining cases (3) were metastases: melanoma, uterine sarcoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The age range of patients affected was 27 to 80 years old with a median age of 57. Five of the nine patients (56%) were male, and 4 patients (44%) had passed away already at the time of this study, with a median survival of 4.5 months after surgery. Of note, all but one (89%) of the total patients had received radiation therapy prior to biopsy. From our institutional experience, chromothripsis is an indication of highgrade malignant neoplasms, both primary CNS tumors and metastases, with decreased survival.",Excluded
2840,"Radioprotective effects of exogenous glutathione against whole-body gamma-ray irradiation: age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in rat liver Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities.

1476,"Upfront gefitinib/erlotinib treatment followed by concomitant radiotherapy for advanced lung cancer: A mono-institutional experience Background: Upfront tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has proved effective for selective advanced lung cancer patients in Taiwan. We hypothesized that early integration of radiotherapy during TKI treatment would decrease the chance of drug resistance and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): This study included 25 patients with stage IIIb or IV non-squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer (NSqCLC) who responded to upfront TKI treatment. Multi-target radiotherapy was administered during the TKI treatment course. Tomotherapy comprising a hypofractionated schedule with a dose of 40-50. Gy in 16-20 fractions was used for individual metastatic lesions. Result(s): The patients' median follow-up duration was 30 months (range, 9-62 months). Of the 23 patients who had stage IV disease, 9 had oligometastases (<=5 gross target volumes) and 14 were in the more advanced stages of the disease. Twelve patients received more than 1 cycle of radiotherapy (median, 3; range, 2-6) with TKI being the only systemic treatment before they were salvaged with chemotherapy. The overall response rate after radiotherapy was 84.0%, and the median PFS was 16 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.1-85.8%). Toxicities were generally tolerated but it is necessary to prevent radiation-induced pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): We showed that combined first-line TKI therapy and early multi-target radiotherapy are very effective in selected patients that respond to TKI, when the status of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are not known before the treatment. Our data may aid expansion of the effectiveness of TKI treatment through radiotherapy in Asian patients with stage IV NSqCLC. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
2694,"CT Angiography in the Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease Feasibility of an Ultra-Low Volume Contrast Media Protocol Purpose: The ALARA principle is not only relevant for effective dose (ED) reduction, but also applicable for contrast media (CM) management. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the feasibility of an ultra-low CM protocol in the assessment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty PAD patients were scanned on third-generation dual-source computed tomography, from diaphragm to the forefoot, as follows: tube voltage: 70 kV, reference effective tube current: 90 mAs, collimation: 192 x 2 x 0.6 mm, with individualized acquisition timing. The protocol ED (mSv) was quantified with dedicated software. CM protocol consisted of 15 ml test bolus and 30 ml main bolus (300 mgI/ml) injected at 5 ml/s, followed by a 40 ml saline chaser at the same flow rate. Aorto-popliteal bolus transit time was used to calculate the overall acquisition time and delay. Objective (hounsfield units-HU; contrast-to-noise ratio-CNR) and subjective image quality (four-point Likert score) were assessed at different anatomical regions from the aorta down to the forefoot. Result(s): Mean attenuation values were exceeding 250 HU from aorta down to the anterior tibial artery with CNR < 13. However, decline in attenuation was observed in more distal region with mean values of 165 and 199 HU, in left and right dorsalis pedis artery, respectively. Mode subjective image quality from the level of aorta down to the popliteal segment was excellent; below the knee mode score was good. The mean ED per protocol was 1.1 +/- 0.5 mSv. Conclusion(s): Use of an ultra-low CM volume protocol at 70 kV is feasible in the evaluation of PAD, resulting in good to excellent image quality with mean ED of 1.1 +/- 0.5 mSv.

It has been shown that at the G0 stage of a cell cycle the frequency of chromosome aberrations does not depend on the dose rate of 252Cf radiation within the range of 0.0035-0.35 Gy/min. by the neutron component. Linear correlation between the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations and a dose was observed within a dose range of 0.27-3.1 Gy.

783,"Concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in parotid gland undifferentiated carcinoma Aims and background: Undifferentiated carcinoma of the parotid gland is a poor-prognosis lesion. Results in unresectable lesions, treated with radiotherapy alone, are very disappointing. Method(s): Six patients with T3-4 N0-1 inoperable lesions were treated with conventional radiotherapy (64-70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction 5 times a week) and concomitant cisplatin (100 mg/m2, days 1, 22 and 43). Four weeks after radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin, 80 mg/m2, day 1, + VP16, 100 mg/m2, days 1, 3 and 5, q = 3 weeks, for 3 cycles) was given. Result(s): A median dose of 66 Gy (range, 64-70 Gy) was delivered, and all patients received 3 courses of cisplatin during radiotherapy. Five of 6 patients received all three chemotherapeutic adjuvant courses. Two months after the end of treatment, 3 CR (50%), 2 PR (33%) and 1 NC (16%) was observed.

It is essential to understand how the cohorts of exposed populations have been defined and what mechanisms can be used to study their health outcomes. Different international scientific research collaborations currently investigate four population groups chronically exposed to ionizing radiation during the late 1940s and early 1950s in the Russian Federation and in Kazakhstan. In this framework, collaborations have been established to develop cause-of-death registers in each of these four areas for future mortality follow-up purposes with the aim of studying the health effects of ionizing radiation. The emphasis of this effort is on assessing the information sources available, the mechanisms of data collection and coding, and the data quality and completeness of the information collected.

1742,"Influence of dose rate on survival time for 239PuO2-induced radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis in dogs Beagle dogs were exposed once or repeatedly to 0.75-microns-diameter monodisperse aerosols of 239PuO2 by pernasal inhalation. The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included
2541,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included

On the other hand, the transposition of multiple perforator flaps or skin grafting on the donor sites is required for larger defects. The authors used a stellate design to elevate a perforator flap with large dimensions, whilst allowing the easier closure of the donor defect. This method was used for reconstructing the sacral (six cases), trochanteric (one case), and lower leg (three cases) regions. Although minor wound dehiscence at the donor sites was encountered in three cases, all the defects were reconstructed successfully using a single perforator flap. This design would be a valuable option for planning a pedicled perforator flap, particularly when a difficult donor closure is expected.",Excluded
2040,"Potential values of metabolic tumor volume and heterogeneity measured with 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment to evaluate local control for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with nonsurgical therapy Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the predictive value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/computed tomography (CT) pretreatment on local control (LC) and survival after radical radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to discuss its potential value for establishing optimal radiation treatment plans. Method(s): Fifty-eight patients with pathologically proven esophageal SCC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT pretreatment in our center were retrospectively reviewed. We examined the correlation between the PET parameters of primary tumors and LC and overall survival. The coefficient of variation was used to estimate the 18F-FDG uptake in heterogeneity. Result(s): The mean duration of follow-up for surviving patients was 38 months, and 36 patients died because of tumor recurrence or other diseases. The rates of 3-year overall survival and LC were 40.4 and 50.4%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of LC revealed that metabolic tumor volume (MTV) greater than 16.08ml was the only predictor of outcome, with a lower 3-year LC (P = 0.017, hazard ratio: 1.608, 95% confidence interval: 1.090-2.371). The coefficient of variations of their primary lesion were higher compared with those of patients who had smaller MTVs. Conclusion(s): In this study, MTV assessed by PET/CT might be an adverse factor for predicting LC in esophageal SCC. For those with higher MTVs, higher intratumor heterogeneity suggests that irradiation may need to be boosted in stable high-uptake regions to improve LC. These results need to be prospectively validated in larger cohorts.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy. Doses < 50.0 Gy for stage III Merkel cell carcinoma were associated with worsened 3-year overall survival (P < 0.0001) and increased hazard of death (2.01, confidence interval 1.43-2.82) with respect to doses between 50.0 and 57.0 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support doses of 50-57 Gy for most patients with stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma receiving conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy. In contrast to a prior National Cancer Database analysis, our results suggest doses >= 50 Gy should be strongly considered for patients with stage III Merkel cell carcinoma regardless of anatomic subsite.

1644,"Towards improved prognostic scores predicting survival in patients with brain metastases: A pilot study of serum lactate dehydrogenase levels Accurate prognostic information is desirable when counselling patients with brain metastases regarding their therapeutic options and life expectancy. Based on previous studies, we selected serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a promising factor on which we perform a pilot study investigating methodological aspects of biomarker studies in patients with brain metastases, before embarking on large-scale studies that will look at a larger number of candidate markers in an expanded patient cohort. For this retrospective analysis, 100 patients with available information on LDH treated with palliative whole-brain radiotherapy were selected. A comprehensive evaluation of different LDH-based variables was performed in uni- and multivariate tests. Probably, the most intriguing finding was that LDH kinetics might be more important, or at least complement, information obtained from a single measurement immediately before radiotherapy. LDH and performance status outperformed several other variables that are part of prognostic models such as recursive partitioning analyses classes and graded prognostic assessment score. LDH kinetics might reflect disease behaviour in extracranial metastatic and primary sites without need for comprehensive imaging studies and is a quite inexpensive diagnostic test. Based on these encouraging results, confirmatory studies in a larger cohort of patients are warranted. Copyright 2012 Carsten Nieder et al.",Excluded

Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT).

Coronary artery segments were assessed for image quality and significant luminal diameter narrowing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and accuracy of both CTCA groups were determined using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) as reference standard. Radiation dose values were calculated., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding gender, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, severity of CAD, mean heart rate, heart rate variability, and Agatston score (all p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of non-assessable coronary segments between group 1 (1.6%, 24/1404) and group 2 (1.4%, 19/1385; p=0.77); non-diagnostic image quality was significantly (p<0.001) more often attributed to stair step artifacts in group 1. Segment-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 98%, 98%, 88%, 100%, and 100% among group 1; 96%, 99%, 90%, 100%, and 98% among group 2, respectively. Parameters of diagnostic performance were similar (all p>0.05). Mean effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (2.2+/-0.4 mSv) was significantly (p<0.0001) smaller than that of retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA (8.1+/-0.6 mSv)., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-gated CTCA yields similar image quality, performs as accurately as retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA in patients having heart rates <=70 bpm while being associated with a lower mean effective radiation dose.

3045,"Self-awareness of computed tomography ordering in the emergency department OBJECTIVES: Physician variation in the use of computed tomography (CT) is concerning due to the risks of ionizing radiation, cost, and downstream effects of unnecessary testing. The objectives of this study were to describe variation in CT-ordering rates among emergency physicians (EPs), to measure correlation between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates, to assess attitudes that influence decisions to order imaging tests, and to identify EP attitudes associated with higher CT utilization., METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of imaging and administrative billing records at two emergency department sites of a tertiary care adult teaching hospital. The study also included a cross-sectional survey of EPs at this hospital. We asked physicians about their perceived ordering behaviour, and what factors influenced their decision to order a CT. We examined correlations between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates. We adjusted ordering rates for shift distribution using a logistic regression model and identified outlier physicians whose ordering rate was significantly lower or higher than expected. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine which survey responses predicted higher CT utilization., RESULTS: During the study period, 59 EPs saw 45,854 patients, and ordered 6,609 CTs - a mean ordering rate of 14.4% (standard deviation (SD)=4.3%). The ordering rate for individual physicians ranged from 5.9% to 25.9%. Of the 59 EPs, 13 EPs were low-ordering outliers; 12 were high-ordering outliers. Forty-five EPs (76.3%) completed the survey. Mean perceived ordering rate was 12.6%, and was weakly correlated with actual ordering (r=0.19, p=0.21). 42 EPs (93.3%) believed they ordered ""about the same"" or ""fewer"" CTs than their peers. Of the 17 EPs in the two highest ordering quintiles, only 3 (18%) knew they were high orderers. In the multivariable analysis, higher ordering was associated with increasing strength of response to the following predictors: medico-legal risk (relative risk [RR]=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21), risk of contrast (RR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.22), what colleagues would do (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 0.99-1.19), risk of missing a diagnosis (RR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.98-1.21), and patient wishes (RR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.17)., CONCLUSIONS: There is large variation in CT ordering among EPs. Physicians' self-reported ordering rate correlates poorly with actual ordering. High CT orderers were rarely aware that they ordered more than their colleagues. Higher rates of ordering were observed among physicians who reported increased concern with 1) risk of missing a diagnosis, 2) medico-legal risk, 3) risk of contrast, 4) patient wishes, and 5) what colleagues would do.",Excluded
2403,"Efficacy of sonography as a guidance technique for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes OBJECTIVE: In the United States, CT is generally considered the guidance technique of choice for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sonography for this purpose., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We attempted 26 sonographically guided biopsies of five abdominal, six pelvic, and 12 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 23 patients. The patients included 19 women and four men who were 26-76 years old (mean, 50 years old). The nodes were less than 2 cm in 16 patients, 2-3 cm in four patients, and greater than 3 cm in three patients. Biopsies were considered successful if the nodes could be visualized and biopsied using sonographic guidance and the pathologist's final report indicated that the tissue specimens obtained were adequate for diagnosis. The length of the procedures and the number of complications were recorded., RESULTS: Lymph nodes were visualized and biopsied with sonographic guidance in 23 (88%) of the 26 attempts. Three biopsies could not be performed with sonography because of poor visualization of the nodes. Adequate tissue for cytologic or histologic evaluation was obtained in 21 (91%) of the 23 sonographically guided procedures. In the 21 successful procedures, clinical and imaging follow-up showed no evidence of false-negative diagnoses. The time from the placement of the patient in the interventional sonography room to completion of the procedure ranged from 25 to 60 min (mean, 35 min) for sonographically guided biopsies. We had no procedure-related complications., CONCLUSION: Sonography is an accurate and safe guidance technique for lymph node biopsies in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. This technique is efficacious for deep nodes as small as 1 cm in diameter. The advantages of sonography over CT include no need for ionizing radiation, portability, shorter procedure time, and real-time visualization of the needle throughout the procedure. These advantages, and the fact that sonography costs less than CT, suggest that sonography is a more appropriate guidance technique in this era of cost containment.",Excluded

Target shifts and rotations relating to CT-based planned reference surface were determined with real-time optical surface images using modified iterativeclosest-point alignment. A selected light ray intersecting the middle-upper abdominal surface and the anterior surface of the target projected onto the principal components were used as the real-time point/marker-based and surface/volume-based motion tracking, respectively. The optical guidance and real-time respiratory motion tracking were completely performed by therapists and results were semi-automatically saved in the camera-control computer. The target displacements (shifts and rotations) were compared with results of the weekly CBCT and portal images from EPID. Motion curves of surface Intersection point and surface principal components were also compared with breathing volume curves from the ABC system. Result(s): Daily target setup errors were reduced from 0.9 cm to <0.4 cm by using the 3D/4D video surface-guidance that was always consistent with results of portal images and CBCT if there were no big body motion during CBCT scanning. Higher accuracy and precision of 0.2 cm and longer stability without hardware change for clinical usage in four years were achieved for the video camera operated at the imaging speed and tracking rate of 15 frames per second. The novel intersection point and surface motion trackings were also more sensitive and accurate than that of commercial RPM and ABC systems. UP to 2 cm body sag on the slant breast board during longer IMRT treatments and surface deformation for five large breasts and some patients undertaken deep breath hold irradiation were detected. Conclusion(s): Accurate and precise optical image-guided setup of breast and chest wall targets was clinically validated with thousands of portal images and CBCT scans on 140 patients. More importantly, one can reliably track irregular target motion during daily dose delivery and detect gross target deformation during the entire course of treatment. The video guidance provides us all-time IGRT of breast and chest wall cancer without large volume low dose irradiation in taking daily CBCT and/or portal images.",Excluded
1968,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included
2607,"Real world outcomes of combination and timing of immunotherapy with radiotherapy for melanoma with brain metastases Introduction: Immunotherapy (IT) and radiotherapy (RT) have improved overall survival in patients with melanoma with brain metastasis (MBM). We examined the real-world survival impact of IT and RT combination and timing strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): From the facility-based National Cancer Database (NCDB) data set, 3008 cases of MBM were identified between 2011 and 2015. Six treatment cohorts were identified: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) + IT, SRS alone, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) + IT, WBRT alone, IT alone, and none. Concurrent therapy was defined as IT given within 28 days before or after RT; nonconcurrent defined as IT administered within 28-90 days of RT. The co-primary outcomes were propensity score-adjusted overall survival by treatment regimen and overall survival by RT and IT timing. Result(s): Median overall survival (mOS) was performed for each treatment category; SRS +IT 15.77 m; (95%CI 12.13-21.29), SRS alone (9.33 m; 95%CI: 8.0-11.3), IT alone (7.29 m; 95%CI: 5.35-12.91), WBRT +IT (4.89 m; 95%CI: 3.65-5.92), No RT or IT (3.29 m; 95%CI: 2.96-3.75), and WBRT alone (3.12 m; 95%CI 2.79-3.52). By propensity score matching, mOS for SRS +IT (15.5 m; 95%CI: 11.5-20.2) was greater than SRS alone (10.1 m; 95%CI: 8.4-11.8) (p = 0.010), and median survival for WBRT +IT (4.6 m; 95%CI: 3.4-5.6) was greater than WBRT alone (2.9 m; 95%CI: 2.5-3.5) (p < 0.001). In the SRS +IT group, 24-month landmark survival was 47% (95%CI; 42-52) for concurrent versus 37% (95%CI; 30-44) for nonconcurrent (p = 0.40). Conclusion(s): Those who received IT in addition to WBRT and SRS experienced longer survival compared to RT modalities alone, while those receiving concurrent SRS and IT trended toward improved survival versus nonconcurrent therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

2193,"Different pedicle osteosynthesis for thoracolumbar vertebral fractures in elderly patients Introduction: Pedicle screws' stability, especially in osteoporotic fractures, is a really problem for spinal surgeons. Nowadays, little is known about the influence of different screw types and amount of cement applied. This single-center retrospective observational study has the aim of evaluating the middle- to long-term mechanical performances of different types of screws in elderly patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 91 patients (37 males and 54 females), treated between 2011 and 2016, affected by somatic osteoporotic fractures aged over 65 years were treated. We divided patients into three different populations: solid screws, cannulated screws and cannulated screws augmented with poly methyl methacrylate cement (PMMA). Patients were radiologically evaluated with X-rays in pre- and post-surgery and at the follow-up (FU). Clinical evaluations were made with VAS and Oswestry Disability Index. Result(s): A total of 636 screws were implanted (222 pedicle screws, 190 cannulated and 224 cannulated screws with PMMA augmentation). At FU, we found significative differences between populations in terms of mechanical performances. We founded five cases of loosening; these were reported in solid screws group and in cannulated screws one. No mechanical failures were reported in cannulated screws with augmentation of PMMA. No rods breakage cases were reported. Conclusion(s): All stabilization methods showed good clinical results, but cannulated screws augmented with PMMA seem to provide better implant stability with the lowest rate of loosening.

This study assesses the clinical presentation of such cancers and outcome of basic surgical treatment without primary repair of resulting defects. Method(s): An analysis of sites from head and neck affected by cancers using traditional anatomical landmarks was carried out. The frequency of involvement of each division in malignant skin changes was also documented and compared. Result(s): The eyes were not involved with any malignancy. With the head and neck region partitioned by a transverse line using the lateral canthus of the eye as landmark, the superior portion was found to be involved in 209 lesions, all (100 %) of which were successfully treated. The inferior portion had 119 but enjoyed 92.4 % success rate. With the head and neck region partitioned in the coronal plane using the lateral canthus of the eye as landmark, the posterior portion was involved in 282 lesions, of which 273 (96.8 %) were successfully treated. The anterior portion was involved in 46 lesions, all (100 %) of which were successfully treated. Conclusion(s): Hair appears to protect the skin beneath it from actinic damage and cancers among albinos. Failed treatment was recorded only among lesions on the cheek and neck.

2343,"Potential for radiation dose savings in abdominal and chest CT using automatic tube voltage selection in combination with automatic tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous use of automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) for abdominal and chest CT examinations regarding radiation dose reduction and image quality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 617 patients who all underwent contrast-enhanced chest or abdominal CT and divided them into two groups. In group A, 317 patients who underwent CT with only ATCM and a fixed body mass index-adjusted tube voltage (120 kV or 100 kV) were enrolled. In group B, both ATCM and ATVS were used. Image attenuation and noise were measured in different anatomic regions., RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of abdomen and chest CT was higher in group B compared with group A (p < 0.0001). In total, the effective radiation doses for abdomen and chest CT examinations were significantly reduced in group B by 18% compared with group A (p < 0.0001). When only examining those who benefited from the ATVS tool, a dose reduction of 35% for chest CT and 42% for abdomen CT could be achieved (p < 0.0001 for each)., CONCLUSION: The simultaneous use of ATVS and ATCM enables significant radiation dose reduction in abdominal and thoracic contrast-enhanced CT examinations compared with the use of ATCM alone.",Excluded
807,"Reanalysis of Hanford data: 1944-1986 deaths Reanalysis of Hanford data by a method, which is new only in the sense that it makes new uses of standard epidemiological procedures, has produced evidence of a cancer risk at low dose levels. By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded
1224,"Mechanisms for discomfort glare in central vision PURPOSE: The presence of a bright light source in the visual field can generate visual discomfort. Based on empirical observations we can predict to a reasonable degree of accuracy how uncomfortable a given lighting installation is likely to be; yet very little is known about the mechanism or physiological underpinnings that lead to visual discomfort. This study attempts to elucidate some of the underlying mechanisms by controlling the amount of light reaching the retina and by varying photometric properties of the glare source., METHODS: The participants were required to view a source of light presented against a simulated residential street background in the form of uniform flashes of light of varying intensity. Discomfort-glare thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure; the dependent variable was retinal illuminance. The size of the glare source and the luminance of the surrounding background were varied systematically., RESULTS: Across glare-source sizes or background luminances the discomfort-glare threshold varied less in terms of retinal illuminance than it did in terms of pupil-plane illuminance or light flux. A two-stage model based on saturation of photoreceptors followed by summation of an edge response signal that defines the edges of the glare-source accurately predicted the data., CONCLUSIONS: Discomfort glare in central vision is more closely associated with the spatial properties of the glare source, such as contrast-defined edges, than the overall amount of light entering the eye. The results suggest that discomfort glare in lighting installations could be reduced while maintaining adequate illuminance levels by an appropriate choice of illuminant source size.

2874,"Effects of nonionic contrast media on platelet aggregation: assessment by particle counting with laser-light scattering Intravascular radiographic contrast media used in angiography, particularly nonionic contrast media, may cause activation of platelets. This study was designed to determine which properties of nonionic contrast media were potentially responsible for this action. Platelet aggregation after adenosine diphosphate stimulation was studied in the platelet rich plasma obtained from 37 patients who underwent left ventriculography using the highly sensitive method of particle counting with laser-light scattering. Platelet activation by contrast media was studied in the platelet rich plasma from healthy volunteers using flow cytometric analysis to detect platelet degranulation as P-selectin expression. There was a significant decrease in platelet aggregation in patients injected with ioxilan or iomeprol compared with patients injected with iohexol. There was a significant increase in P-selectin expression with the three groups of contrast media compared to control. The platelet activation with ioxilan or iomeprol was significantly less compared to the activation with iohexol. The comparison showed that previous generalization regarding platelet activation by nonionic contrast media might not be valid. It is presumed that the higher osmolality of iohexol may contribute to the increase in platelet aggregation and activation.",Excluded
223,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
2595,"Narrow band ultraviolet B 311 nm in the treatment of vitiligo: Two right-left comparison studies Aim: Evaluation of narrow band ultraviolet B (NB UVB 311 nm) in the treatment of vitiligo by two independent studies. The first study compared NB UVB with a well-established therapeutic modality, psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA), and the second study was conducted to find out whether psoralen might add to its efficacy. Method(s): In the first study, 15 patients were exposed on the left half of their body to UVB 311 nm and then exposed on their right half to UVA after ingestion of psoralen. In the second study, 20 patients were exposed to UVB 311 nm on the left side of the body, followed by ingestion of psoralen and exposure to NB UVB 311 nm 90 min later to the right side of the body. In both studies, while exposing one side, the other was protected by an UV-proof gown. Thus two right-left comparative studies were carried out simultaneously, namely: UVB 311 nm vs. PUVA and UVB 311 nm vs. PUVB 311 nm. Result(s): In the first study, comparison of PUVA and NB UVB 311 nm showed no difference either in the degree of response or in the incidence of complications. In the second study, comparison of PUVB and UVB showed equal clinical improvement on both sides. The cumulative dose needed to achieve the same response on the PUVB side was lower than that on the UVB side, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of phototoxic reactions was significantly higher on the PUVB treated body half. Conclusion(s): NB UVB 311 nm has similar repigmentary effects as PUVA. The addition of psoralen does not increase its efficacy. Copyright © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.",Excluded
174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded

In the capacity of additional tests, loading tests involving in vitro irradiation at the dose of 1 Gy of a suspension of lymphocytes and incubations for 5 and 24 hours were used. Activation of the initial apoptotic and necrotic death of peripheral blood lymphocytes was revealed in the persons chronically exposed to low-intensity radiation within the range from 0.01 to 4.23 Gy. Exposed patients demonstrated a decrease in the number of CD95(+)-cells as compared to unexposed patients. The results of the cell death studies in the persons residing in the Techa riverside villages testify indirectly to the genomic instability of the peripheral blood lymphocytes.",Excluded
2427,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae may cause dyspnoea and hospitalisations in young healthy adults Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) from the respiratory tract has become widely available, but the interpretation of the results remains unclear. M. pneumoniae has been suggested to cause mainly mild and self-limiting infections or asymptomatic carriage. However, systematic analyses of the association between PCR results and clinical findings are scarce. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of PCR-positive M. pneumoniae infections in a hospital setting. We reviewed 103 PCR-positive patients cared for in a university hospital during a 3-year period. Data on age, sex, health condition, acute symptoms, other pathogens found, laboratory and X-ray results and treatments were collected. Over 85% of the patients had a triad of typical symptoms: fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract were rare. In 91% of the cases, M. pneumoniae was the only pathogen found. The highest incidence was found in the age group of 30-40 years, and 68% of the patients did not have any underlying diseases. Most patients were initially empirically treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and needed 2-4 changes in their treatment. Only 6% were discharged without an antibiotic effective against M. pneumoniae. This study shows that M. pneumoniae often led to hospitalisation and that patients needed appropriate antimicrobial treatment to recover. Mixed infections were rare, and situations that could be interpreted as carriage did not occur.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
2094,"Segmental Differences in Radiation-Induced Alterations of Tight Junction-Related Proteins in Non-Human Primate Jejunum, Ileum and Colon Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included
3114,"Conservative treatment by irradiation of epidermoid cancers of the anal canal: prognostic factors of tumoral control and complications UNLABELLED: We analyzed in a retrospective series of patients treated by conservative irradiation for an epidermoid cancer of the anal canal (ECAC) the prognostic factors of locoregional control (LRC), survival, late severe complications (LSC), and sphincter conservation (SC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1976 until 1994, 118 patients presenting with an ECAC were conservatively treated (mean age, 65 years). According to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer (TNM) classification, they were: 19 T1, 70 T2, 22 T3, 7 T4, 94 N0, and 24 N1-3. The treatment started with external beam irradiation (EBI) (36 Gy in 3 weeks or 45 Gy in 5 weeks). Concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C) was delivered to 31 patients. Two months later, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by interstitial 192Ir brachytherapy to 101 patients and EBI in 5. Twelve other patients had an abdominoperineal resection (APR). The mean follow-up was 6 years., RESULTS: At 5 years the overall survival was 60%, and specific survival (SS) was 75%; it was 94% for T1, 79% for T2, 53% for T3, and 19% for T4. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (> or = 4 cm), node involvement, and no response to the EBI were factors of poor prognosis for SS. Thirty-two locoregional recurrences occurred of which 21 were local recurrences in the 106 patients treated by a conservative schedule. Only tumor size and response to the EBI were prognostic factors on multivariate analysis for local and LRC. A total of 17 patients presented with LSC (Grade 3, 16 patients; and Grade 4, 1 patient), which was treated by APR in 4 patients and colostomy in 11 (of which 7 were definitive). The only significant prognostic factor for LSC in the multivariate analysis was the total extrapolated response dose of irradiation. The definitive rate of SC after conservative treatment in cured patients was 100% for T1, 82% for T2, 58% for T3, and 100% for T4. Since 1989, improvements of the technique have allowed reduction of the LSC in maintaining the same local control., CONCLUSION: The results of this series are similar to those of the literature. The confirmation of pretherapeutic prognostic factors related to response to the treatment should allow us to adapt the therapeutic intensity for each case to obtain better tumor control, with as few sequelae as possible, to yield a better rate of SC.",Excluded

Method(s): Specific surveys of agricultural workers in Switzerland and France were conducted (N=1538). Multivariate logistic regressions identified occupational sunburn determinants. Occupational and recreational sun protection habits were estimated and correlated. Result(s): One-year occupational and recreational sunburn prevalences were 19.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Occupational sunburn increased with having a recent recreational sunburn, highly sensitive skin, young age, high perceived skin cancer risk, using sunscreen, and not wearing a hat. Correlation between protection habits during work and leisure was substantial (r s 0.5 to 0.7). Skin health knowledge was high and pro-tanning attitude moderate.

3063,"16. The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010 This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included

354,"Left bundle branch block and suspected myocardial infarction: Does chronicity of the branch block matter? Background: Our aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB). Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence of ST-segment concordance in this population. Method(s): Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at Orebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or >=80 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. Result(s): A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group >=80 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. Conclusion(s): The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test. © The European Society of Cardiology 2013.",Excluded
66,"Occipitocervical fixation in the management of craniocervical instabilities Introduction: The occipitocervical junction presents a unique, complex, biomechanical interface between the cranium and the upper cervical spine. Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity. A comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the occipital-cervical junction is imperative. A wide variety of stabilization techniques and instrumentation systems are currently available, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. © 2011.",Excluded
216,"Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (Astro-CHARM) Coronary Calcium Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a powerful novel risk indicator for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Currently, there is no available ASCVD risk prediction tool that integrates traditional risk factors and CAC., METHODS: To develop a CAC ASCVD risk tool for younger individuals in the general population, subjects aged 40 to 65 without prior cardiovascular disease from 3 population-based cohorts were included. Cox proportional hazards models were developed incorporating age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension treatment, family history of myocardial infarction, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and CAC scores (Astro-CHARM model [Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification]) as dependent variables and ASCVD (nonfatal/fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) as the outcome. Model performance was assessed internally, and validated externally in a fourth cohort., RESULTS: The derivation study comprised 7382 individuals with a mean age 51 years, 45% women, and 55% nonwhite. The median CAC was 0 (25th, 75th [0,9]), and 304 ASCVD events occurred in a median 10.9 years of follow-up. The c-statistic was 0.784 for the risk factor model, and 0.817 for Astro-CHARM ( P<0.0001). In comparison with the risk factor model, the Astro-CHARM model resulted in integrated discrimination improvement (0.0252), and net reclassification improvement (0.121; P<0.0001), as well. The Astro-CHARM model demonstrated good discrimination (c=0.78) and calibration (Nam-D'Agostino chi2, 13.2; P=0.16) in the validation cohort (n=2057; 55 events). A mobile application and web-based tool were developed to facilitate clinical application of this tool ( www.AstroCHARM.org )., CONCLUSION: The Astro-CHARM tool is the first integrated ASCVD risk calculator to incorporate risk factors, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history, and CAC data. It improves risk prediction in comparison with traditional risk factor equations and could be useful in risk-based decision making for cardiovascular disease prevention in the middle-aged general population.",Excluded
798,"Bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-methoxypsoralen in mycosis fungoides PUVA therapy is widely used for early stage mycosis fungoides. While the efficacy of PUVA with oral 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is well documented, the use of its topical variation, bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 8-MOP bath-water PUVA therapy in adult patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of bath-water delivery of 8-MOP (1 mg l(-1)) in 16 patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. In all patients complete response was achieved after a mean duration of 63 days requiring 29 treatments and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 33 J cm(-2). The time to relapse after complete clinical clearance was 45.6 (+/-9.2) weeks. In comparison, oral PUVA therapy with 8-MOP resulted in complete response after 64.5 days (25.8 treatments) with a mean relapse-free period of 30 (+/-3.5) weeks. We conclude that bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP is a valuable photo-therapeutic alternative, which should be considered for patients in whom systemic psoralen cannot be used.",Excluded
1086,"Functional changes cardiovascular: normobaric activity and microgravity in young healthy human subjects BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular system works to maintain homeostasis through a series of adaptive responses to physiological requirements. Different self-regulatory mechanism prevent the effects induced by hydrostatic pressure changes on oncotic pressure caused by postural changes. Gravity exerts a strong influence on the postural changes with implications on the cardiovascular system. In orbit, gravity (+Gz) is responsible of mass redistribution of circulating blood flow. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the adaptive responses of cardiovascular system to postural changes with and without the use of the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP). We considered that pressure changes that occur in human body in orbit can be simulated experimentally with use of Tilt-Test (Clino/ortho; Clino/head-down; head-down/ortho). This investigation could be useful for studying the influence on astronauts of long flights., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied in 12 months, 30 young healthy volunteers (20 males, 10 female) during postural change tests. In the first evaluation they were submitted to tilt-test for 40 minutes, remaining in head-up +60 degrees (this state corresponds to a kind of gravitational stress +Gz) and in head-down to -30 degrees (-Gz) for 20 minutes. During the second assessment (after 5 +/- 1 days) all volunteers wear a device that simulate a state of LBNP at -20 mmHg. Afterwards, they were processed to 20 minutes in Head Down -8 degrees and after 2 hours of rest to 20 minutes at -15 degrees. Volunteers were monitored measuring blood pressure, heart rate and by Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)., RESULTS: Collected data were elaborated by a statistical analysis. We observed during orthostatic position for 40 min (+60 degrees) without LBNP, lower diameters and volumes of left and right ventricular (p < 0.05) and an increase in heart rate in comparison with the baseline conditions in clinostatism. Despite the reduction of preload volume, the mean value of cardiac output does not vary significantly. In Trendelemburg (-15 degrees) data show a non-significant variation (p > 0.05) of left and right ventricular diameters and volumes, while cardiac output and systolic blood pressure varies significantly (p < 0.05) compared to clinostatic and orthostatic position. With LBNP in head down to -8 degrees and -15 degrees, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, ventricular volumes and cardiac output were unchanged if compared to values obtained in clinostatism with and without LBNP. If compared to -30 degrees in Trendelemburg without LBNP, data reached statistical significance (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular system and the autonomic nervous system, respond to postural changes and to volemia alterations, maintaining the physiological cardiac output, in order to preserve the metabolic requirements of body.",Excluded
1578,"Perception of longitudinal body axis in microgravity during parabolic flight It has been proposed that an internal representation of body vertical has a prominent role in spatial orientation. This investigation investigated the ability of human subjects to accurately locate their longitudinal body axis (an imaginary straight body midline running from head to toes) while free-floating in microgravity. Subjects were tested in-flight, as well as on ground in normal gravity in both the upright and supine orientations to provide baseline measurements. The subjects wore a goggle device and were in total darkness. They used knobs to rotate two luminous lines until they were parallel to the subjective direction of their longitudinal body axis, in the roll (right/left) and the pitch (forward/backward) planes. Results showed that the error between the perceived and the objective direction of the longitudinal body axis was significantly larger in microgravity than in normal gravity. This error in this egocentric frame of reference is presumably due to the absence of somatosensory cues when free-floating. Mechanical pressure on the chest using an airbag reduced the error in perception of the longitudinal body axis in microgravity, thus improving spatial orientation.",Excluded
2484,"Facing the nuclear threat: Thyroid blocking revisited Context: People being exposed to potentially harmful amounts of radioactive iodine need prophylaxis to prevent high radiation-absorbed doses to the thyroid. Objective(s): Parameters determining the individual protective effect of a pharmacological intervention were investigated. Design and Participants: Biokinetics of 123I was evaluated in 27 healthy volunteers (aged 22-46 yr, median 25 yr, in total 48 assessments) twice in a baseline measurement of the undisturbed kinetics and in an intervention assessment 48 h later. Intervention(s): Seven regimens using single doses of potassium iodide (KI) or sodium perchlorate (SP) at different times relative to exposure were compared: 100 mg KI (-24, 2, 8, 24 h), 100 mg SP (2 h), or 1 g SP (2, 8 h). Main Outcome Measure(s): Different drugs and dosages and the influence of individual parameters of iodine kinetics should be tested. Result(s):Meandose reductions for interventions at -24, 2, 8, and 24 h relative to the activity incorporation were88.7,59.7,25.4,and2.8%,respectively.OnegramSPwasequallyeffectiveas100mgKI; residualuptake was observed after 100 mg SP. The individual dose reduction decreased exponentially with the effective half-life of the activity in the blood.

1365,"Development of a medical examination program for former workers at a Department of Energy national laboratory BACKGROUND: As a part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Former Workers' Medical Surveillance Program, a Needs Assessment was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The objective was to identify former LANL employees who may be at significant risk for occupational disease and determine whether a medical examination program could reduce morbidity or mortality. We describe the needs assessment approach used at LANL., METHODS: An algorithm was developed to make needs determinations. Information on factors including exposure, health impacts, size of exposed populations, and LANL worker concerns and recommendations were obtained. Each of these factors was scored from 1 to 3. The resulting factor sum was then multiplied by a binary (1 or 0) intervention suitability factor which was 1 if both of the following were available: (1) a screening test with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the health outcome of concern; and (2) an intervention that decreases morbidity or mortality. This resulted in an Intervention Needs Score that was used to set priorities for the medical examination program for the estimated 35,000 former LANL workers., RESULTS: Analysis of the algorithm output suggested that six exposure categories be recommended for consideration in a medical examination program. Beryllium, asbestos, and noise clearly warranted inclusion. Lead and ionizing radiation required careful consideration regarding availability of screening tests. Solvents were problematic due to the lack of screening tests and suitable intervention in formerly exposed workers., CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm approach to the needs assessment at LANL documented that six chemical and physical agents should be considered as candidates for inclusion in a medical examination program for former workers.

135,"Simulator training reduces radiation exposure and improves trainees' performance in placing electrophysiologic catheters during patient-based procedures Background: Currently, training in interventional electrophysiology is based on conventional methodologies, and a paucity of data on the usefulness of simulation in this field is available. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulator training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Method(s): Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7.0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1.5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1-3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Result(s): Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1.71 +/- 1.24 to 0.42 +/- 0.68 (P <.001), from 121 +/- 88 seconds to 76 +/- 54 seconds (P <.001), and from 175 +/- 138 seconds to 102 +/- 74 seconds (P <.001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 +/- 220 seconds to 305 +/- 111 seconds (P <.0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures. Conclusion(s): During the early phase of the trainees' learning curve, simulator training significantly improves the independent trainees' performance with reduction in radiation exposure. © 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

2991,"Contamination of banked femoral head allograft: Incidence, bacteriology and donor follow up Background: Allograft donations are not uncommonly found to be contaminated. The issue of contaminated donations from live donors at the time of surgery, and the significance of this to the patient in terms of subsequent sepsis of the arthroplasty, were examined. Method(s): The donations of femoral heads to the Queensland Bone Bank over a 9-year period were reviewed, and the incidence and bacteriology of contamination were detailed. Clinical outcomes were determined for donors who had positive cultures at the time of retrieval and they were compared with those of culture-negative donors. Result(s): Between March 1987 and February 1996, 232 femoral heads were donated to the Queensland Bone Bank. Four specimens were sent for culture with each femoral head (surface swab of femoral head, acetabular swab, bone biopsy and capsule). In 51 cases, one or more positive cultures were obtained (22% contamination rate). The majority of organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidermidis. One hundred and seventy donations came from surgery performed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and 40 femoral heads were considered contaminated. Deep infection was recorded in one of the 40 cases with contaminated donations and three out of 130 non-contaminated donations had subsequent septic episodes. Conclusion(s): The contamination rate detailed in the present report is higher than in most series. This may be due to the fact that four bacteriological specimens are taken to assess contamination. Two of these specimens are tissue samples which yielded more positive results than did the two swabs. All other series take no more than two bacteriological specimens, which are usually bone swabs. These are shown to have a poor yield of positive cultures. Therefore there is a significant underestimation of contamination rates by other bone banks. This has implications for the recipients of bone from those banks, particularly when the allograft material is not secondarily sterilized. This is important given increasing allograft usage, and the increasing numbers of revision joint arthroplasty and impaction grafting procedures being performed. Sterilization of all bone by irradiation to 25 kGy is recommended.",Excluded
3087,"Gamma Knife surgery anterior capsulotomy for severe and refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder Clinical article Object: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a challenging psychiatric condition associated with anxiety and ritualistic behaviors. Although medical management and psychiatric therapy are effective for many patients, severe and extreme cases may prove refractory to these approaches. The authors evaluated their experience with Gamma Knife (GK) capsulotomy in treating patients with severe OCD. Method(s): A retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical GK database was conducted for patients treated for severe OCD. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by at least one psychiatrist, and their condition was deemed refractory to pharmacological and psychiatric therapy. Result(s): Five patients were identified. Gamma Knife surgery with the GK Perfexion unit was used to target the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally. A single 4-mm isocenter was used; maximum radiation doses of 140-160 Gy were delivered. All 5 patients were preoperatively and postoperatively assessed for clinical response by using both subjective and objective metrics, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); 4 of the 5 patients had postoperative radiological follow-up. The median clinical follow-up was 24 months (range 6-33 months). At the time of radiosurgery, all patients had YBOCS scores in the severe or extreme range (median 32, range 31-34). At the last follow-up, 4 (80%) of the 5 patients showed marked clinical improvement; in the remaining patient (20%), mild improvement was seen. The median YBOCS score was 13 (range 12-31) at the last follow-up. Neuroimaging studies at 6 months after GK treatment demonstrated a small area of enhancement corresponding to the site of the isocenter and some mild T2 signal changes in the internal capsule. No adverse clinical effects were noted from the radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): for patients with severe OCD refractory to medications and psychiatric therapy, GK capsulotomy afforded clinical improvement. Further study of this approach seems warranted. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded
1686,"MRI of small hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison with US, CT, DSA, and Lipiodol-CT Thirteen cirrhotic patients with 27 nodules of hepatocellular carcinoma less than 3 cm (small HCC) were examined with ultrasonography (US), MR, pre- and postcontrast CT, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), and CT after injection of Lipiodol (Lipiodol-CT). The accuracy of MR was compared with other diagnostic modalities and MR morphologic and the signal intensity features of HCC were investigated. The detection rate by MR was 63%, by US 67%, by CT 50%, by DSA 74%, and by Lipiodol-CT 93%. The Mc Nemar test showed no difference between the detection rates of MR and CT, MR and DSA, MR and US, and Lipiodol-CT and DSA; however, the differences between the detection rates of MR and Lipiodol-CT and CT and Lipiodol-CT were statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05). The difference in sensitivity between the detection rates of Lipiodol-CT and US was just above the level considered significant (P less than or equal to 0.065). On T1- and T2-weighted spin echo images 83% of small HCC were hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma. Pseudocapsule was observed in 58% of lesions on T1-weighted images in particular. We believe that US is still the best diagnostic technique for the screening of HCC. We prefer MR to CT as a second level examination to support US in noninvasive diagnosis of small HCC, since MR gives the same or slightly better results than CT without the need of ionizing radiation and large amounts of iodized contrast medium. In our opinion, more invasive examinations, such as DSA and Lipiodol-CT, cannot be avoided in cases where an exact knowledge of the number of lesions is essential for the choice of therapy.",Excluded
1133,"Occupational Health Risks in Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Workers BACKGROUND: Orthopedic strain and radiation exposure are recognized risk factors in personnel staff performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures. However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years). Skin lesions (P=0.002), orthopedic illness (P<0.001), cataract (P=0.003), hypertension (P=0.02), and hypercholesterolemia (P<0.001) were all significantly higher in exposed versus nonexposed group, with a clear gradient unfavorable for physicians over technicians and nurses and for longer history of work (>16 years). In highly exposed physicians, adjusted odds ratio ranged from 1.7 for hypertension (95% confidence interval: 1-3; P=0.05), 2.9 for hypercholesterolemia (95% confidence interval: 1-5; P=0.004), 4.5 for cancer (95% confidence interval: 0.9-25; P=0.06), to 9 for cataract (95% confidence interval: 2-41; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Health problems are more frequently observed in workers performing fluoroscopically guided cardiovascular procedures than in unexposed controls, raising the need to spread the culture of safety in the cath laboratory.

2808,"Bone and joint modeling from 3D ankle MRI: Feasibility and comparisonwith radiographs and 2D MRI Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of creating segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-ray) from 3D isotropic ankle MRI, assess various angular and joint space measurements on models and compare with corresponding radiographs and 2D MRI measurements, and determine differences in time consumption for performing the measurements. Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded
108,"Development of solid self-nanoemulsifying granules (SSNEGs) of ondansetron hydrochloride with enhanced bioavailability potential The current work aims to prepare the solid self-nanoemulsifying granules (SSNEGs) of ondansetron hydrochloride (ONH) to enhance its oral bioavailability by improving its aqueous solubility and facilitating its absorption though lymphatic pathways. Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudoternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as lipid, Labrasol as surfactant, and Tween 20 as cosurfactant for preparation of self-emulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the phase diagrams and subjected to thermodynamic stability studies and dispersibility tests. The prepared liquid SNEDDS formulations were characterized for viscosity, refractive index, droplet size and zeta potential. The TEM study confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion following dilution of liquid SNEDDS. The optimized liquid SNEDDS were transformed into free flowing granules by adsorption on the porous carriers like Sylysia (350, 550, and 730) and Neusilin TM US2. Solid state characterization employing the FTIR, DSC and powder XRD studies indicated lack of any significant interaction of drug with the lipidic and emulsifying excipients, and porous carriers. In vitro drug release studies indicated faster solubilization of the drug by optimized SSNEGs (over 80% within 30 min) vis-a-vis the pure drug (only 35% within 30 min). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats observed significant increase in C(max) (3.01-fold) and AUC (5.34-fold) using SSNEGs compared to pure drug, whereas no significant difference (p>0.1) was observed with the liquid SNEDDS. Thus, the present studies ratify the bioavailability enhancement potential of SSNEGs of ONH prepared using porous carriers. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
348,"Analysis of biologically equivalent dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and metastatic lung tumors Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal biologically equivalent dose (BED) for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) by comparing local control rates in proportion to various total doses and fractionation schedules. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-four patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer and a single metastatic lung tumor were included in this study. Differences in local control rates were evaluated according to gender, primary tumor site, response, tumor size, and BED. For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
780,"The pattern and time course of somatosensory changes in the human UVB sunburn model reveal the presence of peripheral and central sensitization The ultraviolet B (UVB) sunburn model was characterized with a comprehensive battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST). Primary hyperalgesia in UVB-irradiated skin and secondary hyperalgesia in adjacent nonirradiated skin were studied in 22 healthy subjects 24h after irradiation with UVB at 3-fold minimal erythema dose of a skin area 5 cm in diameter at the thigh and compared to mirror-image contralateral control areas. The time course of hyperalgesia over 96 h was studied in a subgroup of 12 subjects. Within the sunburn area, cold hyperesthesia (P=.01), profound generalized hyperalgesia to heat (P<.001), cold (P<.05), pinprick and pressure (P<.001), and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia (P<.001) were present. The finding of cold hyperalgesia and cold hyperesthesia is new in this model. The sunburn was surrounded by large areas of pinprick hyperalgesia (mean+/-SEM, 218+/-32 cm(2)) and a small rim of dynamic mechanical allodynia but no other sensory changes. Although of smaller magnitude, secondary hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia adjacent to the UVB-irradiated area were statistically highly significant. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia developed in parallel within hours, peaked after 24-32 h, and lasted for more than 96 h.

2127,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included
336,"Dose escalation via brachytherapy boost for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and combined chemotherapy To investigate if dose escalation using intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) improves local control for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CCRT). We retrospectively analyzed 232 patients with Stage T1-3 N0-3 M0 NPC who underwent definitive IMRT with or without additional ICBT boost between 2002 and 2013. For most of the 124 patients who had ICBT boost, the additional brachytherapy was given as 6 Gy in 2 fractions completed within 1 week after IMRT of 70 Gy. CCRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy was used for 176 patients, including 88 with and 88 without ICBT boost, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 63.1 months. The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 81.5% and 91.5%, respectively. ICBT was not associated with local control prediction (P = 0.228). However, in a subgroup analysis, 75 T1 patients with ICBT boost had significantly better local control than the other 71 T1 patients without ICBT boost (98.1% vs 85.9%, P = 0.020), despite having fewer patients who had undergone chemotherapy (60.0% vs 76.1%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that both ICBT (P = 0.029) and chemotherapy (P = 0.047) influenced local control for T1 patients. Our study demonstrated that dose escalation with ICBT can improve local control of the primary tumor for NPC patients with T1 disease treated with IMRT, even without chemotherapy.

1590,"Simplified screening for immune complexes by laser nephelometry of ultracentrifuged serum Serum samples were drawn from 14 healthy volunteers after an overnight fast and again after a meal. Each sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20 min, and a portion from the middle of the tube was removed by puncturing the tube's side. All samples were then added to cuvettes containing 0.14 M NaCl alone or 1, 2, 3, or 4% polyethylene glycol in 0.15 M KCl. The light scattering of each tube was measured. The centrifuged samples scattered 58% less light than the uncentrifuged controls. The range of values obtained with the centrifuged samples was also smaller as reflected in the standard deviation of the means obtained at each polyethylene glycol concentration. The coefficient of variation for replicate samples ranged from 0 to 16.6% (mean 5.8%), even when samples were processed differently. Storage at -70 degrees C significantly increased light scattering compared to baseline values. Serum samples were drawn from 44 patients with diseases that have been associated with immune complexes. Nephelometry selectively identified some groups of patients as abnormal. We conclude that preparative ultracentrifugation removes much of the background light scattering of serum samples, including that due to lipid, under conditions that do not sediment out immune complexes. Because it measures a physical property of immune complexes, this assay may provide information that is not available from biological receptor-based assays.",Excluded
2049,"Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and age effects on florbetapir positron emission tomography in healthy aging and Alzheimer disease Objectives: Investigate apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE4) gene and aging effects on florbetapir F18 positron emission tomography (PET) in normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Method(s): Florbetapir F18 PET images were analyzed from 245 participants, 18-92 years of age, from Avid Radiopharmaceutical's multicenter registered trials, including 86 younger healthy control volunteers (yHC), 61 older healthy control volunteers (oHC), 53 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and 45 AD dementia patients (DAT). Mean florbetapir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were used to evaluate the effects of APOE4 carrier status, older age, and their interaction in each of these groups. Result(s): In comparison with non-carriers, the APOE4 carriers in each of the oHC, MCI, and DAT groups had higher mean cortical-to-cerebellar florbetapir SUVRs, patterns of florbetapir PET elevations characteristic of DAT, and a higher proportion meeting florbetapir PET positivity criteria. Only the oHC group had a significant association between mean cortical florbetapir SUVRs and age. In cognitively normal adults, without regards to APOE4 genotype, amyloid began to increase at age 58 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.3-63.7), with a predicted typical age of florbetapir positivity occurring around age 71 years. Presence of the APOE4 gene reduced the age of predicted florbetapir positivity in normal aging to around age 56 years, approximately 20 years younger than non-carriers. Interpretation(s): Cerebral amyloid deposition is associated with APOE4 carrier status in older healthy control subjects and symptomatic AD patients, and increases with age in older cognitively normal individuals. Amyloid imaging positivity appears to begin near age 56 years in cognitively intact APOE4 carriers and age 76 years in APOE4 non-carriers. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

813,"Seventy-Peak Kilovoltage High-Pitch Thoracic Aortic CT Angiography without ECG Gating: Evaluation of Image Quality and Radiation Dose RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of 70-kVp high-pitch non-ECG-gated thoracic aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) with 40-mL contrast agent compared to 100-kVp standard-pitch CTA with 60-mL contrast agent., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients (51 men and 16 women; mean age, 55 +/- 14 years) received non-ECG-gated aortic CTA at 70 kVp, high pitch of 3.4, and 40-mL contrast agent (group A, n = 31) or CTA at 100-kVp, pitch of 1.2, and 60-mL contrast agent (group B, n = 36). Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05). Interreader agreement was good or excellent for image quality assessment (k = 0.625-0.835). The 70-kVp CTA protocol, which allows dose reduction of 85%, was considered diagnostic in all instances by two readers., CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed thoracic aortic CTA protocol provides diagnostic information with substantial reduction of both radiation and contrast agent doses compared to standard-pitch CTA at 100 kVp.

2244,"Head and neck radiotherapy does not increase gelatinase (metalloproteinase-2 and -9) expression or activity in teeth irradiated in vivo OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

2508,"Cancers after renal transplantation in Tunisia: Multicenter experience Introduction: Renal transplant recipients are at higher risk of certain tumors such as lymphomas and skin cancers than the general and dialysis populations. Method(s): We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in five Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monastir, sousse and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2008. Result(s): The study included 52 patients; 32 men and 20 women with a mean age of 36 years (range from 18-54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 46 months (20-236 months). Induction therapy was based on thymoglobulin in 100 % and administered in a mean course of 12.4 days in 82,2 % of the patients. Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 91,2 % of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 % of cases. Acute rejection occurred in 36 of these cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 % of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 6,6 % and occurred after a mean period of 55,4 months of transplantation for solid tumors and 99 months for skin tumors. Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 58.6 % and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 21.7 % of the solid tumors, while spinocellular carcinoma formed 83% and basocellular carcinoma 17% of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8.3% cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 28.3% of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 54.7% cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion(s): We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and excessive Induction and maintenance immunosuppression. Careful follow-up may results in early intervention and decrease mortality.",Excluded
315,"High-pitch versus sequential mode for coronary calcium in individuals with a high heart rate: Potential for dose reduction BACKGROUND: To determine the impact of high-pitch spiral acquisition on radiation dose and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification by coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment with computed tomography in individuals with a high heart rate., METHODS: Of the ROBINSCA trial, 1990 participants with regular rhythm and heart rates >65 beats per minute (bpm) were included. As reference, 390 participants with regular heart rates <=65 bpm were used. All participants underwent prospectively electrocardiographically(ECG)-triggered imaging of the coronary arteries using dual source CT at 120kVp, 80 ref mAs using both high-pitch spiral mode and sequential mode. Radiation dose, Agatston score, number of positive scores, as well as median absolute difference of the Agatston score were determined and participants were stratified into CVD risk categories., RESULTS: A similar percentage of participants with low heart rates and high heart rates had a positive CAC score in data sets acquired in high-pitch spiral (low heart rate: 57.7%, high heart rate: 55.8%) and sequential mode (58.0%, 54.7%, p=n.s.). The median absolute difference in Agatston scores between acquisition modes was 14.2% and 9.2%, for the high and low heart rate groups, respectively. Excellent agreement for risk categorization between the two data acquisition modes was found for the high (kappa=0.927) and low (kappa=0.946) heart rate groups. Radiation dose was 48% lower for high-pitch spiral versus sequential acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Radiation dose for the quantification of coronary calcium can be reduced by 48% when using the high-pitch spiral acquisition mode compared to the sequential mode in participants with a regular high heart rate. CVD risk stratification agreement between the two modes of data acquisition is excellent. Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

3237,"Association of clinical response and long-term outcome among patients with biopsied orbital pseudotumor receiving modern radiation therapy Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate institutional outcomes for patients treated with modern radiation therapy (RT) for biopsied orbital pseudotumor (OP). Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (26 affected orbits) with OP were treated with RT between January 2002 and December 2011. All patients underwent biopsy with histopathologic exclusion of other disease processes. Sixteen patients (80%) were treated with intensity modulated RT, 3 (15%) with opposed lateral beams, and 1 (5%) with electrons. Median RT dose was 27 Gy (range 25.2-30.6 Gy). Response to RT was evaluated at 4 months post-RT. Partial response (PR) was defined as improvement in orbital symptoms without an increase in steroid dose. Complete response (CR) 1 and CR 2 were defined as complete resolution of orbital symptoms with reduction in steroid dose (CR 1) or complete tapering of steroids (CR 2). The median follow-up period was 18.6 months (range 4-81.6 months). Result(s): Seventeen patients (85%) demonstrated response to RT, with 7 (35%), 1 (5%), and 9 (45%) achieving a PR, CR 1, and CR 2, respectively. Of the 17 patients who had >=PR at 4 months post-RT, 6 (35%) experienced recurrence of symptoms. Age (>46 years vs <=46 years, P=.04) and clinical response to RT (CR 2 vs CR 1/PR, P=.05) were significantly associated with pseudotumor recurrence. Long-term complications were seen in 7 patients (35%), including 4 with cataract formation, 1 with chronic dry eye, 1 with enophthalmos, and 1 with keratopathy. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective treatment for improving symptoms and tapering steroids in patients with a biopsy supported diagnosis of OP. Older age and complete response to RT were associated with a significantly reduced probability of symptom recurrence. The observed late complications may be related to RT, chronic use of steroids/immunosuppressants, medical comorbidities, or combination of factors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

1966,"The risk of cataractogenesis after gamma knife radiosurgery: a nationwide population based case-control study BACKGROUND: Medical radiation is considered a factor responsible for cataractogenesis. However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23). The age group between 30 and 50 years had the highest risk of cataractogenesis in both the GK and CT/angio groups (cHR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.58-7.72; aHR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.81; cHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.47-5.99; aHR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.05-4.93, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure due to GKRS and CT/angio study may be independently associated with increased risk of cataractogenesis. We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included
2700,"Endovascular Treatment of Long Superficial Femoral Artery-Chronic Total Occlusions Using the Gogo Catheter With IVUS Via a Popliteal Puncture Method Is Effective, Safe, and Useful Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inserting a 6Fr sheath guided by duplex ultrasonography via a popliteal artery puncture. We also aimed to demonstrate endoluminal tracking using a retrograde approach using the Gogo catheter with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Background(s): The bidirectional approach is useful for increasing the success rate of the procedure for long superficial femoral artery-chronic total occlusions (SFA-CTOs). However, this procedure becomes somewhat complicated. Since the proximal blood vessel diameter is clearly larger than the distal end of the CTO and the body surface duplex guide can also be used in the proximal part, it is easier to introduce a retrograde guidewire (GW) into the proximal end. Method(s): We performed endovascular treatment for long SFA-CTOs with a Gogo catheter + IVUS guide in 31 consecutive cases (male 20/female 11; mean age, 75.6 +/- 7.6) from May 2017 to November 2018. We advanced the IVUS until the true lumen could be confirmed and advanced the Gogo catheter toward the IVUS for reinforcement. We attempted to approach the long CTO by repeating this procedure. We named this procedure the GIP method (GIP: Gogo catheter with IVUS via a popliteal puncture). Hemostasis of the popliteal artery was achieved using a commercially available compression hemostatic kit (Tometa-kun, XEMEX, Japan). Result(s): Successful revascularization was achieved in all cases (in 2 cases, a femoral artery puncture was added, and a bidirectional approach was used, and in 1 case, a CROSSER system was used). On average, the fluoroscopy time was 42.2 +/- 30.4 minutes, radiation dose 93.7 +/- 78.7 mGy, and amount of contrast medium used 15.0 +/- 9.6 mL. The procedure time was defined as from the start of the popliteal artery puncture to the time the GW passed through the CTO lesion, including the posture transformation time from prone to the supine position. The procedure time was 42.1 +/- 40.2 minutes. There were no major adverse events or other major complications, such as a distal embolism, rupture of the CTO lesion, arteriovenous fistula, or major hematoma requiring a transfusion or surgical treatment. Only 2 small hematomas occurred at the popliteal artery puncture site. The patients were treated conservatively and were discharged as usual. Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of long SFA-CTOs via the popliteal approach was effective and safe. Using the GIP method to address long SFA-CTOs is recommended.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
3174,"Sweat gland function as a measure of radiation change BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may result in dryness of the skin even when no other change can be detected. We describe a system for recording the electrical conductance of skin as a measure of sweat gland function., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 normal volunteers close agreement was obtained between measurements obtained from comparable sites on both sides of the chest. Measurements were subsequently made in 38 patients treated by radiotherapy to one side of the chest for tumours of the breast or lung using one of five different fractionation schedules. Simultaneous readings were obtained from both sides of the chest with the non irradiated side acting as a control., RESULTS: A dose response relationship was demonstrated: five patients who received the equivalent total dose of 15 Gy in 2-Gy fractions showed no change in conductance. Sixteen out of 23 who received an equivalent total dose of 42-46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions had a greater than 22% reduction in mean skin conductance compared with that of the control areas despite the skin appearing normal in the large majority. Marked changes in skin conductance were seen after higher total doses. In a prospective study 18 women receiving breast irradiation underwent weekly readings during treatment. A mean reduction of 40% in skin conductance was noted by the end of the second week of treatment prior to any clinical evidence of radiation change. Skin conductance returned to normal in 44% of patients by 6 months. In the remainder, those patients who showed the greatest reduction in skin conductance during treatment demonstrated the least recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sweat gland function can be detected and quantified in skin which may otherwise appear normal. Differences may so be demonstrated between areas treated using different fractionation schedules and the method may be applied to the detection during radiotherapy of unusually sensitive patient.",Excluded

A prospective cohort of 35,705 cataract-free US radiologic technologists aged 24-44 years was followed for nearly 20 years (1983-2004) by using two follow-up questionnaires. During the study period, 2,382 cataracts and 647 cataract extractions were reported.

Findings challenge the National Council on Radiation Protection and International Commission on Radiological Protection assumptions that the lowest cumulative ionizing radiation dose to the lens of the eye that can produce a progressive cataract is approximately 2 Gy, and they support the hypothesis that the lowest cataractogenic dose in humans is substantially less than previously thought.",Included
1242,"Dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography at lower heart rates: comparison of accuracy and radiation dose PURPOSE: To compare the diagnostic performance and radiation doses of dual-source and 64-section computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiography for the diagnosis of significant coronary stenoses in patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study had local ethics committee approval; all patients gave written informed consent. Two hundred patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less were enrolled; 100 underwent dual-source and 100 underwent 64-section CT coronary angiography. Two blinded observers independently assessed image quality of all coronary segments by using a four-point scale and searched for significant (>50%) stenoses in each segment. Catheter angiography was used as the reference standard. Image noise was measured in the ascending aorta. Radiation doses were calculated., RESULTS: No significant differences were found regarding sex, age, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, prevalence of stenosis, mean and variability of heart rate, Agatston score, and image noise (all P > .1) between patients in both CT coronary angiography groups. No significant difference was found in the rate of nonassessable coronary segments between dual-source (1.0%, 14 of 1405) and 64-section CT coronary angiography (1.8%, 25 of 1387; P = .08). Motion artifacts occurred significantly more often in 64-section (21 of 25) versus dual-source (five of 14, P = .004) CT coronary angiography. Segment-based accuracy and specificity were significantly higher for dual-source versus 64-section CT coronary angiography. There was no significant difference in accuracy parameters at the per-vessel and per-patient analyses. No significant difference (P = .13) was found between the effective doses of dual-source (mean +/- standard deviation, 10.9 mSv +/- 1.1) and 64-section CT (10.4 mSv +/- 1.7) coronary angiography., CONCLUSION: In patients with heart rates of 65 beats/min or less, the higher temporal resolution of dual-source CT coronary angiography results in improved accuracy and specificity for the diagnosis of significant stenoses on a per-segment level at a similar radiation dose, but provides a comparable diagnostic accuracy on a patient-based level as does 64-section coronary angiography.",Excluded
868,"Toxicity Related to Radiotherapy Dose and Targeting Strategy: A Pooled Analysis of Cooperative Group Trials of Combined Modality Therapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer OBJECTIVE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs)., METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus >=60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models., RESULTS: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543-1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501-2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035-1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191-1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses.

2880,"The features of radiation induced lung fibrosis related with dosimetric parameters BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation induced lung fibrosis (RILF) is a major complication after lung irradiation and is very important for long term quality of life and could result in fatal respiratory insufficiency. However, there has been little information on dosimetric parameters for radiotherapy planning in the aspect of RILF. The features of RILF related with dosimetric parameters were evaluated., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma who underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) without adjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. The degree of lung fibrosis was estimated by fibrosis volume and the dosimetric parameters were calculated from the plan of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy., RESULTS: The fibrosis volume and V-dose as dosimetric parameters showed significant correlation and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.602 to 0.683 (P<0.01). The degree of the correlation line was steeper as the dose increase and threshold dose was not found. Mean lung dose (MLD) showed strong correlation with fibrosis volume (correlation coefficient = 0.726, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The fibrosis volume is continuously increased with V-dose as the reference dose increases. MLD is useful as a single parameter for comparing rival plans in the aspect of RILF. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3336,"Clinical efficacy of 2-phase versus 4-phase computed tomography for localization in primary hyperparathyroidism BACKGROUND: Four-dimensional computed tomography is being used increasingly for localization of abnormal glands in primary hyperparathyroidism. We hypothesized that compared with traditional 4-phase imaging, 2-phase imaging would halve the radiation dose without compromising parathyroid localization and clinical outcomes., METHODS: A transition from 4-phase to 2-phase imaging was instituted between 2009 and 2010. A pre-post analysis was performed on patients undergoing operative treatment with a parathyroid protocol computed tomography, and relevant data were correlated with operative findings. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, technical success, and cure rates were calculated. The Fisher exact test or chi(2) test assessed the significance of 2-phase and 4-phase imaging and operative findings., RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients had traditional four-dimensional computed tomography and 35 had modified 2-phase computed tomography. Effective radiation doses were 6.8 mSy for 2-phase and 14 mSv for 4-phase. Four-phase computed tomography had a sensitivity and positive predictive value of 93% and 96%, respectively. Two-phase computed tomography had a comparable sensitivity and positive predictive value of 97% and 94%, respectively. Eight patients with discordant imaging had an average parathyroid weight of 240 g compared with 1,300 g for all patients. Technical surgical success (90% for 4-phase computed tomography versus 91% 2-phase computed tomography) and normocalcemia rates at 6 months (88% for both) did not differ between computed tomography protocols. Computed tomography correctly predicted multiglandular disease and localization for reoperations in 88% and 90% of cases, respectively, with no difference by computed tomography protocol., CONCLUSION: With regard to surgical outcomes and localization, 2-phase parathyroid computed tomography is equivalent to 4-phase for parathyroid localization, including small adenomas, reoperative cases, and multiglandular disease. Two-phase parathyroid computed tomography for operative planning should be considered to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2867,"[Delayed medical consequences of the Chernobyl accident in Armenia. Assessment of life quality and accelerated biological aging of accident liquidators] In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered. Biological aged-related passportization in a definite part of liquidators elucidated an accelerated aging rate. The studies were performed with the help of SF-36 inquirer and indicated that health status aggravation of the liquidators also affected their life satisfaction. The ""life quality"" indices of the liquidators significantly concede the overall average standards by both physical health and psychical and social welfare scales.",Included
3303,"Late effects of radiation therapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease In the last two decades, a considerable amount of clinical and experimental animal data has been accumulated regarding the tolerance of the major normal tissues and organs traversed by the radiation beams in treating Hodgkin's disease. Typically, the tolerance of several tissues and organs must be considered in designing the very large radiation portals such as the mantle. Today, sophisticated machinery such as computerized tomography scanners, simulators, computers, and linear accelerators are available to improve the radiation planning and treatment of Hodgkin's disease. In this paper, we discuss the late effects of radiation therapy to the lung, heart, thyroid, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and the gonads of adults with Hodgkin's disease.

3204,"Sunlight exposure and cardiovascular risk factors in the REGARDS study: A cross-sectional split-sample analysis Background: Previous research has suggested that vitamin D and sunlight are related to cardiovascular outcomes, but associations between sunlight and risk factors have not been investigated. We examined whether increased sunlight exposure was related to improved cardiovascular risk factor status. Method(s): Residential histories merged with satellite, ground monitor, and model reanalysis data were used to determine previous-year sunlight radiation exposure for 17,773 black and white participants aged 45+ from the US. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses were performed by randomly dividing the sample into halves. Logistic regression models were used to examine relationships with cardiovascular risk factors. Result(s): The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein levels in adjusted exploratory (-2.7 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -4.2, -1.2]) and confirmatory (-1.5 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -3.0, -0.1]) models. The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in unadjusted exploratory and confirmatory, as well as the adjusted exploratory model (2.3 mmHg [95% confidence interval: 0.8, 3.8]), but not the adjusted confirmatory model (1.6 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -0.5, 3.7]). Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that lower long-term sunlight exposure has an association with lower high-density lipoprotein levels. However, all associations were weak, thus it is not known if insolation may affect cardiovascular outcomes through these risk factors. © 2014 Kent et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

3408,"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the para-nasal sinus (pns) malignancies Purpose/Objective(s): Due to the difficulties of air tissue interface interactions as well as the close proximity to the optical apparatus, tumors in the PNS region treated with IMRT may have increased local failure and higher complications. The clinical outcome of patients treated with IMRT for PNS malignancies are reported. Materials/Methods: Between May 2001 and June 2008, 31 patients with PNS malignancies were treated with IMRT to a median dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions. There were 13 males and 18 females, with median age 68 years. Seventeen (59%) patients had AJCC stage III/IV disease at presentation. Twenty one of 31 patients presented with clinical stage N0 neck disease. Elective nodal irradiation (ENI) is not considered due to low incidence of lymph node metastases among these patients. Histology was: 14 squamous cell, 3 adenocarcinoma, 3 adenoid cystic, 6 mucosal melanoma, 5 others. The base of skull was treated in 3 patients with perineural invasion. Median RT dose values to optic apparatus were: Optic chiasm Dmax 22 Gy (range: 1-48); right and left optic nerve Dmax were 39, 37 Gy (range: 2-62; 2-65) and right, left parotid glands were 17; 25 Gy (range: 7-30; 5-53) respectively. Clinical outcomes and toxicities were measured. Result(s): Median follow-up was 27 months (range: 4-98). The 2- and 5-year local control and overall survival rates were 89%, 82% and 75%, 66%, respectively.

3369,"Outcome analysis of adjuvant chemoradiation after incomplete resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the outcome of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent incomplete resection, and to identify the prognostic factors for these patients. Materials/Methods: Data from 41 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent R1 or R2 resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy from January 1987 to March 2010 was collected. There were 27 men and 14 women, and the median age was 60 years (range, 40-84). The adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was delivered to the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes. Radiation dose was less than 50 Gy for 22 patients and at least 50 Gy for 19 patients. The chemotherapy during radiotherapy was either 5-fluorouracil (n = 37) or capecitabine (n = 4). The median follow-up duration was 15.8 months (range 4.5 -53.4). Result(s): The median survival was 13.2 months and the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 17% ; the median time to failure was 7.5 months and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 9% ; the median time to distant metastasis was 9.2 months and the 2- year distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) rate was 27% ; the median time to locoregional failure was 10.8 months and the locoregional failure free survival (LRFFS) rate was 16%. On univariate analysis, nodal involvement (p = 0.046), post-operative CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs>37 U/mL,p=0.027) and post-RT CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs.37 U/mL, p<0.001) were associated with OS. Nodal involvement (p = 0.053 for PFS, p = 0.029 for LRFFS), initial CA 19-9 (<=1000 U/mL vs .1000 U/mL, p = 0.029 for PFS,p=0.003 for LRFFS), post-operative CA 19-9 (p=0.03 for PFS,p= 0.035 for LRFFS) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001 for PFS and LRFFS) were statistically significant prognosticators for PFS and LRFFS. For DMFS, nodal involvement (p=0.054) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001) were significant prognosticators. On multivariate analysis, only post-RT CA 19-9 showed statistical significance for all outcomes. There was no difference in all outcomes between R1 resection and R2 resection. RT dose was not a significant prognostic factor for all outcomes. However, in a subgroup analysis of 21 patients who had pancreatic head cancer and underwent 3-dimensional conformal RT, lower radiation dose was related with inferior PFS and DMFS (p = 0.085 and p = 0.068, respectively). Conclusion(s): Patients with pancreatic cancer after incomplete resection have poor outcomes even after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Nodal involvement and CA 19-9 were prognostic factors, whereas increased radiation dose showed marginal significance.",Excluded
2409,"Imaging Findings Within the First 12 Months of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Purpose: To correlate the imaging findings of treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with explant pathology and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response. Methods and Materials: From 2007 to 2015, of 146 patients treated with liver SBRT for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma, 10 were identified with inclusion criteria and had regular interval follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/triple phase computed tomography and explant pathology or declining AFP values for radiology-pathology response correlation. Reference standards for successful response were >90% necrosis on explant pathology or pretreatment AFP >75 ng/mL normalizing to <10 ng/mL within 1 year after SBRT without other treatment. Subjects were treated with 24 to 50 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. Multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SBRT was compared with pretreatment imaging by 2 expert radiologists. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): There were 10 subjects with 10 treated HCCs, classified as 3 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 5a, 4 OPTN 5b, and 3 OPTN 5x. All had successfully treated HCCs, according to explant pathology or declining AFP. Four of 10 HCCs had persistent central arterial hyperenhancement 3 to 12 months after SBRT; persistent wash-out was common up to 12 months (9 of 10). Of 10 treated HCCs, 9 exhibited decreased size at 12 months. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion showed early (3-6 months) hyperemia followed by late (6-12 months) capsular retraction and delayed enhancement. No patient had a significant decline in liver function. Conclusion(s): In the absence of increasing size, persistent central arterial hyperenhancement and wash-out can occur within the first 12 months after SBRT in successfully treated HCCs and may not represent residual viable tumor. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the treated lesion showed inflammation followed by fibrosis, without significant change in hepatic function. Until a radiologic signature of tumor control is determined, freedom from local progression seems to be the best measure of HCC control after SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

788,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included

Method(s): In this retrospective controlled study, 780 patients with single segment degenerative lumbar disease who were operated in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomly assigned to Wiltse approach group (group A, 410 cases) and conventional open approach group (group B, 370 cases). Patient's assessment of pain and disability were evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. The incision length, operative time, exposure time, intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, serum creatine kinase, X-rays, CT and MRI were also evaluated. Result(s): There were no differences in sex, age, pre-operative ODI score, VAS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). The Wiltse approach group had a shorter incision length with 7.69 +/- 0.44 cm compared to the conventional group with 11.13 +/- 0.36 cm (P < 0.01). The average operative time was 119.20 +/- 14.64 min with exposure time of 16.20 +/- 3.42 min in the Wiltse approach group and 145.65 +/- 16.98 min with 29.20 +/- 3.42 min in the conventional group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Comparing the intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, serum creatine kinase, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, the Wiltse approach group was less than the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The VAS score of the two groups decreased significantly with time, and the VAS score of the Wiltse group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). At last investigation after operation, ODI scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with that before operation. Wiltse approach group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The multifidus of the two groups of patients had a certain degree of atrophy. But the Wiltse approach group multifidus muscle atrophy rate is significantly lower than the conventional open approach group. Conclusion(s): The Wiltse approach TLIF significantly reduces the damage to the paravertebral muscles and the postoperative incidence of chronic low back pain.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Method(s): Between 2005 and 2012, 15 patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer were retreated with 3D-CRT after previously receiving thoracic radiotherapy. The median interval between the initial irradiation and reirradiation was 12 months (range, five to 41 months). The median initial radiotherapy dose was 63Gy (range, 45-70 Gy), and reirradiation doses ranged from 25.2 to 45.2Gy (median, 36Gy), with daily fractions of 1.8-4Gy (median, 2Gy). Result(s): After reirradiation, 80% of the patients experienced resolved or diminished symptoms for one or more of their symptoms, with an 83% improvement in a total of 24 symptoms. The overall tumor response rate to reirradiation was 46.7%, with progressive disease occurring in only one patient. The median overall survival (OS) time was 11 months (range, one to 27 months), and the one-year OS rate was 47%. The progression-free survival time ranged from one to 10 months (median, five months). In univariate analysis, the use of combined chemotherapy and a higher reirradiation dose showed a trend toward improved survival after reirradiation. Treatment-induced toxicity included grade 2 radiation pneumonitis in only one patient, and there were no other complications, such as radiation esophagitis or myelopathy. Conclusion(s): Reirradiation using 3D-CRT with moderate doses for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer can provide palliative benefits without severe complications to the majority of selected patients with symptoms as a result of a regrowing tumor. © 2014 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded

Backscatter measurements were performed using an ultrasonic backscatter bone diagnostic instrument. Backscatter parameters were calculated with a dynamic signal-of-interest method, which was proposed to ensure the same ultrasonic interrogated volume in cortical and trabecular bones. The backscatter parameters exhibited significant correlations with site-matched bone densities provided by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (0.33 < R < 0.72, p < 0.05). Some bone densities and backscatter parameters exhibited significant changes after the 90-d bed rest. The proposed method can be used to characterize bone densities, and the portable ultrasonic backscatter bone diagnostic device might be used to non-invasively reveal mean bone loss (across a group of people) after long-term bed rest and microgravity conditions of spaceflight missions.Copyright © 2021 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology",Excluded
684,"Facial involvement in indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and metabolic syndrome-a cross-sectional study Introduction: Face was often thought to be spared in psoriasis possibly due to the protective effect of sebum and low-dose ambient UV radiation exposure. Few have suggested that facial involvement is common and indicates disease severity. There is a paucity of data on this, particularly from India. Psoriatics have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, patients with severe disease are at greater risk. Objective(s): We decided to study the frequency, type of facial involvement in Indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and MetS. Material(s) and Method(s): 250 consecutive psoriatic patients were enrolled. Facial psoriatics were divided into peripherofacial(PF), centrofacial(CF) and mixed facial(MF) types. Disease severity was assessed using whole body, scalp, facial Psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores and Nail area psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) scores. Patients were evaluated for the presence of MetS using NCEP-III criteria. All parameters were compared both between facial and non-facial psoriatics and, between cases with different types of face involvement. Result(s): The mean age(p-0.04) and age of onset of disease(p-0.02) was lower and median whole body PASI score higher(p<0.001) in psoriatics with facial involvement than those without. No significant association was found between facial involvement and MetS. MF was the commonest type of facial involvement and there was a significant association of mixed facial involvement with increased total body PASI and head PASI scores. (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Facial involvement in psoriatics is associated with severe disease, but not metabolic syndrome. Mixed facial type might be considered a marker of overall psoriasis disease severity in the Indian population.",Excluded

These repair genes have a pivotal role in maintaining genomic stability through different pathways of base excision repair (BER). The aim of this study was to investigate the XRCC3 Thr241Met gene polymorphism in colorectal cancer (CRC) in Kashmir. We investigated the genotype distribution of XRCC3 gene in 120 CRC cases in comparison with 150 healthy subjects and found a significant association between XRCC3 genotypes and CRC (p<=0.05). Both heterozygous genotype (Thr/Met) as well as homozygous variant genotype (Met/Met) were moderately associated with elevated risk of CRC [OR=2.53; OR=2.29 respectively]. Also, Thr/Met and Met/Met genotypes demonstrated a significant association with the risk of CRC (p=0.003).

Chemoradiation (CRT) is a valuable treatment option for(pharyngo)laryngeal squamous cell cancer and a palliative cure in advanced oral cancers. However, toxicity is scarcely reported. Therefore, efficacy, acute and toxic effects of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated, using retrospective study. Methods. Previously untreated patients with stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were included. Radiotherapy consisted of 70 Gy/7 weeks/35 fractions. All patients received concurrent Cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly. Results. The most common acute toxic effects were dysphagia and mucositis. Dysphagia and xerostomia remained problematic during follow-up. Loco regional disease control was respectively 91% and 98% after 6 months. The median overall survival (calculating starting form the end of the treatment) was 33 months (range 0-111 months). The 5-year disease specific survival was 41%. Conclusion. The results indicated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with high locoregional control and disease-specific survival. However, significant acute and long-term toxic effects occur, and organ preservation appears not necessarily equivalent to preservation of function in pharyngolaryngeal cancers.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded
2697,"Factors affecting anxiety among administrative officers working within the urgent protective action planning zone of a nuclear power station The aim of this study was to clarify the factors affecting anxiety among administrative officers working within the urgent protective action planning zone of a nuclear power station to establish an effective education program on radiation and its health effects to help reduce anxiety in residents. We included 1,181 officers who worked at local authorities within the urgent protective action planning zone of Sendai Nuclear Power Station in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex (odds ratio = 2.33), working more than 21 years as an administrative officer (odds ratio = 1.49), lack of participation in training on nuclear disasters (odds ratio = 1.42), and not knowing the three principles of radiation protection (odds ratio = 1.36) were independently associated with anxiety among administrative officers working within the urgent protective action planning zone. It is important to establish an effective education program on radiation and its health effects for administrative officers working within the urgent protective action planning zone to reduce anxiety in residents.",Excluded
84,"Late complications after high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for tongue cancer Objectives. To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded
2259,"Cortical Bone Trajectory Screws in Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion: Minimally Invasive Surgery for Maximal Muscle Sparing - A Prospective Comparative Study with the Traditional Open Technique Introduction. A prospective comparative study between classical posterior interbody fusion with peduncular screws and the new technique with divergent cortical screws was conducted. Material and Methods. Only patients with monosegmental degenerative disease were recruited into this study. We analyzed a cohort of 40 patients treated from January 2015 to March 2016 divided into 2 groups (20 patients went to traditional open surgery and 20 patients under mini-invasive strategy). Primary endpoints of this study are fusion rate and muscular damage; secondary endpoints analyzed were three different clinical scores (ODI, VAS, and EQ) and the morbidity rate of both techniques. Results. There was no significant difference in fusion rate between the two techniques. In addition, a significant difference in muscular damage was found according to the MRI evaluation. Clinical outcomes, based on pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index status, and Euroquality-5D score, were found to be also statistically different, even one year after surgery. This study also demonstrated a correlation between patients' muscular damage and their clinical outcome. Conclusions. Cortical bone trajectory screws would provide similar outcomes compared to pedicle screws in posterior lumbar interbody fusion at one year after surgery, and this technique represents a reasonable alternative to pedicle screws.Copyright © 2018 Nicola Marengo et al.",Excluded
3252,"Prior exposure to medical and dental x-rays related to tumors of the parotid gland Findings from this population-based study in Los Angeles County suggest, for the first time, that tumors of the parotid gland are related to prior exposure to diagnostic medical and dental radiography. Responses to interviews with 408 patients with a parotid tumor (269 benign tumors and 139 malignant tumors) were compared to responses of 408 neighborhood controls. Cumulative exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic radiography was associated with a dose-related increase in risk of malignant tumors (P for trend less than .05; relative risk for exposure to greater than or equal to 50 rad = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-11.46). Benign tumors showed a weaker positive association, and exposure before age 20 to a major diagnostic examination (full-mouth or panoramic dental radiography or medical radiography to the head) increased risk (relative risk = 1.8; confidence interval = 1.13-2.91). This study also confirmed the association of malignant tumors with prior radiation treatment to the head or neck; 28% of these tumors are attributable to exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic and therapeutic radiation.",Included
3147,"Cyberknife treatment for advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Cyberknife treatment for patients with advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival. A radiation dose higher than 30 Gy (HR = 0.274; 95%CI: 0.093-0.7541, P = 0.012) was associated with better survival. In the 52 cases of bone metastasis, 36 patients (69%) achieved pain relief. One patient had cerebral bleeding and another patient had an esophageal ulcer after treatment., CONCLUSION: The Cyberknife can be safely administered to patients with advanced or terminal stage HCC. High AFP levels were associated with worse survival, but a higher radiation dose improved the survival.",Excluded
1056,"Analysis of intrafractional organ motion by megavoltage computed tomography in patients with lung cancer treated with image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy Aim: To analyze intrafractional organ motion in patients with lung cancer treated with image-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy (SBRT-HT). Patients and Methods: Data from 25 patients with lung cancer who received 50 Gy/5 fractions of SBRT-HT were analyzed. Slow-scan megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) images were acquired before (pre-MVCT) and after (post-MVCT) each fraction. We analyzed the imaging quality of the 124 post-MVCT images to identify tumor contours using low-density settings. Next we examined tumor contour deviations from the planning target volume (PTV) in post- MVCT images for intrafractional tumor displacement. Result(s): Image quality was determined as good in 111/124 images from 22 patients (92%). None of the upper lung tumor images were of poor quality (74 images in 15 patients), whereas lower lung tumors yielded 14 poor-quality images out of the 50 images (3/10 patients). The difference in image quality between upper and lower lung tumors was statistically significant (p<0.01), especially when accompanied by interstitial lung shadows. Deviations in tumor position in post-MVCT images were analyzed in 110 images from 23 patients and revealed 99 images (90%) with tumor contours confined to PTV. In upper lung tumors, 4/74 images in 15 patients (5.4%) showed tumor contour deviations outside PTV. Lower lung tumors showed a higher rate of deviation with 7/36 images in 8 patients (19.4%) showing tumor contour deviations outside PTV (p<0.05). The maximum deviation was 1 mm for upper lung tumors and 2 mm for lower lung tumors. Conclusion(s): Upper lung tumors are good candidates for MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT. However, lower lung tumors, especially those adjacent to the diaphragm or pleura, can be difficult to assess, warranting precise dose delivery by MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT.",Excluded

We did this trial to assess the impact of short schedule radiotherapy in patients aged 60 years and older with glioblastoma. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients aged 60 years or older with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) greater than or equal to 70 were treated with postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (34Gy administered in 3.4Gy fractions over 2 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, and tolerance to treatment. Result(s): The median age at surgery was 71 years (range 60-81). No patient received prior or concomitant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, the median progressionfree survival and overall survival were 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.9) and 10 months (95% CI, 8.9-11.1) respectively. Type of surgery (total resection vs. subtotal vs. biopsy) remained a prognostic factor (p=0.034). Tolerance appeared acceptable in terms of KPS changes and corticosteroid use during radiation therapy.

1965,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy for rectal cancer: adherence to evidence-based guidelines in clinical practice Implementation of evidence-based standards is problematic. Level 1 evidence, largely predicated on the German Rectal Cancer Study, supports neoadjuvant treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent this evidence has affected clinical practice. Stage II/III rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery from 1998 to 2007 were identified in the SEER tumor registry. Variables were analyzed with SPSS software. Trends were evaluated with regression models. Survivals were compared with the log-rank test. A total of 22,136 patients were identified and 15,021 (67.8%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. A large percentage were >60 years old (64.4%), white (83.0%), male (58.8%), at stage III (55.1%), and treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (35.5%). A significant increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy occurred: from 17% in 1998 to 51% in 2007 (p < 0.001). Scatter-plot best-fit lines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiotherapy intersected at approximately year 2002. Significant increases in preoperative radiotherapy were observed for all races and cancer stages (p < 0.001). On unadjusted analysis, race (p = 0.018), sex (p < 0.001), year of diagnosis (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001), and stage (p < 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. On logistic regression analysis, male sex [odds ratio (OR) 1.14, p < 0.001), year (OR 1.223, p < 0.001), and stage II (OR 1.39, p < 0.001) were predictors of neoadjuvant therapy.

141,"Quality of Life, Behaviour and Attitudes towards Actinic Keratosis in Spain: The PIQA Study OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to examine patients' knowledge, behaviours and attitudes regarding actinic keratosis (AK) lesions and the impact of the disease on patients' quality of life (QoL)., METHODS: Observational study of patients with AK lesions in Spain. QoL was evaluated with the validated version of Spanish AKQoL questionnaire. Skin self-examination, sun-exposure, habits and attitudes towards AK's treatment were recorded using different questionnaires. The adherence was assessed by means of the Morisky-Green test. Among other variables, QoL and adherence to treatment were compared by using Pearson's chi2 test and one-way ANOVA tests. Inferential analysis regarding such factors and length of treatment were also performed., RESULTS: A total of 1240 patients (73.6 [10.5] years old) were recruited. Overall, patients that showed higher levels of concern were also showed a higher impairment on QoL. AK had greater effects on women's QoL and those who performed skin self-examination, think that AK is a disease and/or believe that moisturizers can prevent skin aging (P<.05). Adherence and length of treatment were strongly related, since patients with treatments intended for <1week were more likely to show good adherence and complete remission of AK (Odds Ratio [95%CI]: 6.25 [4.55-8.33] and 2.63 [1.96-3.45]), respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Concerns due to AK are mainly related to sex and to the consideration of AK as a disease. More concerned patients tend to have lower QoL and good adherence to treatment. Short length of treatment was associated with better adherence and complete remission of AK lesions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with liver cirrhosis underwent 64-section multidetector CT. One hundred twenty kilovolt (peak) (kV[p]) with standard contrast material dose of 600 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol A) and 80 kV(p) with low-contrast material dose of 450 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol B) CT image sets were reconstructed by using FBP algorithm and that of using IR algorithm with a 60%/40% blend of IR-FBP reconstruction at 80-kV(p) image set (protocol C). Scans obtained during 3 hepatic phases were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULT(S): The mean radiation dose and the contrast medium dose were significantly lower under protocols B and C than under protocol A. In all hepatic phases, all signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were greater under protocol C than under other protocols at all anatomic sites. Qualitative analysis showed that image noise and diagnostic acceptability were significantly higher under protocol C. CONCLUSION(S): In all hepatic phases, a low-tube voltage, low-contrast material dose CT with IR algorithm yielded better contrast enhancement and image quality than a standard tube voltage, standard contrast material dose CT with FBP in thin adult patients.

1647,"Treatment of nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with intrahepatic 90Y-microspheres Treatment for nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is palliative. The relatively greater arteriolar density of hepatic tumors compared with normal liver suggests that intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres can be selectively deposited in tumor nodules and results in significantly greater radiation exposure to the tumor than external irradiation. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion (frequency) and duration of response, survival, and toxicity after intrahepatic arterial injection of 90Y-microspheres in patients with HCC. Method(s): Patients with documented HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-3, adequate bone marrow, and hepatic and pulmonary function were eligible for study. Patients who had significant shunting of blood to the lungs or gastrointestinal (GI) tract or who could not undergo cannulation of the hepatic artery were excluded. Patients received a planned dose of 100 Gy through a catheter placed into the hepatic artery. Result(s): Twenty-two patients were treated with 90Y-microspheres; 20 of the treated patients (median age, 62.5 y) were evaluated for treatment efficacy. Nine patients were Okuda stage I, and 11 were Okuda stage II. The median dose delivered was 104 Gy (range, 46-145 Gy). All 22 treated patients experienced at least 1 adverse event. Of the 31 (15%) serious adverse events, the most common were elevations in liver enzymes and bilirubin and upper GI ulceration. The response rate was 20%. The median duration of response was 127 wk; the median survival was 54 wk. Multivariable analysis suggested that a dose >104 Gy (P = 0.06), tumor-to-liver activity uptake ratio >2 (P = 0.06), and Okuda stage I (P = 0.07) were associated with longer survival. Conclusion(s): Significantly higher doses of radiation can be delivered to a HCC tumor by intrahepatic arterial administration of 90Y-microspheres than by external beam radiation. This treatment appears to be beneficial in nonresectable HCC with acceptable toxicity.",Excluded
3381,"A randomized double blind placebo controlled multicenter study of mesalazine for the prevention of acute radiation enteritis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Symptoms of acute radiation enteritis (ARE), dominated by diarrhea, occur in more than 70% of patients receiving pelvic irradiation. Eicosanoids and free radicals release have been implicated in the pathogenesis. Mesalazine (5-ASA) is a potent inhibitor of their synthesis in the mucosa and could therefore be of some interest in preventing ARE., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was performed in six radiotherapy units in France who agreed on standardized irradiation procedures. One hundred and fifty-three patients planned for external beam radiotherapy to the pelvis > or = 45 Gy for prostate (n = 97) or uterus (n = 54) cancer were randomized on a double blind basis to receive prophylactic 5-ASA (4 g/day Pentasa) or placebo. Patients with concomitant chemotherapy were excluded. Prostate and uterus cancers were chosen since these centropelvic tumors require a similar radiotherapy protocol during the first step of treatment and involve a comparable volume of small intestine. The symptoms of ARE and their severity were assessed every week during irradiation, and 1 and 3 months after its end. All patients followed a low fiber and low lactose diet. End points were diarrhea, use of antidiarrheal agents, abdominal pain, and body weight. Effficacy was evaluated using intention to treat., RESULTS: (means +/- SD) Groups did not differ for age (mean 64 +/- 9 years), sex, tumor site, or irradiation procedure. During irradiation, diarrhea occurred in 69% and 66% of the 5-ASA and placebo groups, respectively (chi2, P = 0.22). Curves of survival without diarrhea did not differ between groups (logrank P = 0.09). Severity of diarrhea did not differ between groups except at d15 where it was significantly more severe in the 5-ASA group (ANOVA P = 0.006). Duration of diarrhea did not differ (22 +/- 15 days in both groups, P = 0.88). Abdominal pain was less frequently reported in the 5-ASA group at d28 (34% vs. 51%, P = 0.048). Use of antidiarrheal agents and body weight did not differ between groups., CONCLUSION: Mesalazine 4 g/day did not decrease the symptoms of ARE.",Excluded

A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1380,"Cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians Primary care physicians can play a key role in prevention and early detection of cancer. To assess cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians in Missouri, we conducted a random survey of 207 physicians. Although reported knowledge of the role tobacco plays in cancer causation was high, activity in tobacco cessation counselling and referral was low. Respondents considered diet to be a relatively unimportant factor in cancer causation, whereas they viewed sun exposure, genetics/family history, and radiation exposure as large contributors to the cancer burden. Among cancer early detection tests, high activity was shown for the Pap test and breast examination. Conversely, low activity was reported for colon sigmoidoscopy. Inverse correlations were shown between age group of the physician and several cancer prevention and early detection practices. For each cancer prevention and screening practice, reported activity was higher for medical doctors than for doctors of osteopathic medicine. Possible barriers or controversies in cancer control included disagreement with the current recommendation for Pap testing, the cost of mammography, and patient fear of sigmoidoscopy. These findings suggest that primary care physicians are not achieving their full potential in cancer control and indicate areas where increased emphasis is warranted.",Excluded
2232,"Influence of postoperative low-level laser therapy on the osseointegration of self-tapping implants in the posterior maxilla: A 6-week split-mouth clinical study Background/Aim. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been proven to stimulate bone repair, affecting cellular prolifera-tion, differentiation and adhesion, and has shown a potential to reduce the healing time following implant placement. The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the influence of postoperative LLLT osseointegration and early success of self-tapping implants placed into low-density bone. Meth-ods. Following the split-mouth design, self-tapping implants (n = 44) were inserted in the posterior maxilla of 12 patients. One jaw side randomly received LLLT (test group), while the other side was placebo (control group). For LLLT, a 637 nm gallium-aluminum-arsenide (GaAlAs) laser (Medicolaser 637, Technoline, Belgrade, Serbia) with an output power of 40 mW and continuous wave was used. Low-level laser treat-ment was performed immediately after the surgery and then repeated every day in the following 7 days. The total irradia-tion dose per treatment was 6.26 J/cm2 per implant. The study outcomes were: implant stability, alkaline-phosphatase (ALP) activity and early implant success rate. The follow-up took 6 weeks. Results. Irradiated implants achieved a higher stability compared with controls during the entire follow-up and the difference reached significance in the 5th postoperative week (paired t-test, p = 0.030). The difference in ALP activ-ity between the groups was insignificant in any observation point (paired t-test, p > 0.05). The early implant success rate was 100%, regardless of LLLT usage. Conclusion. LLLT applied daily during the first postoperative week expressed no significant influence on the osseointegration of self-tapping implants placed into low density bone of the poste-rior maxilla. Placement of self-tapping macro-designed im-plants into low density bone could be a predictable thera-peutic procedure with a high early success rate regardless of LLLT usage.Copyright © 2015, Institut za Vojnomedicinske Naucne Informacije/Documentaciju.

Expression of Epstein-Barr virus gene products will affect the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells. Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included

1098,"Combined concomitant boost radiotherapy and chemotherapy in stage III-IV head and neck carcinomas: a comparison of toxicity and treatment results with those observed after radiotherapy alone BACKGROUND: Alteration of radiation therapy (RT) fractionation and the combination of chemotherapy (CT) with RT represent two predominant fields of current research in the treatment of head and neck carcinomas. To assess the potential integration of these two fields, a retrospective comparison of toxicity and treatment outcome was carried out in stage III-IV patients treated with a concomitant boost RT schedule with or without CT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated by RT alone and 35 by RT and CT. In the RT group, there were significantly fewer T3-4 tumors (56% vs. 88%, P = 0.002) and higher proportion of planned neck dissections (35% vs. 14%, P = 0.047). The planned total dose was 69.9 Gy delivered over 5.5 weeks. In 10 cases CT was given before RT and in 25 concomitantly with RT, either alone or with neoadjuvant and/ or adjuvant CT. All patients but two had cisplatin-based (CDDP, 100 mg/m2) CT, associated in 28 patients with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 1000 mg/m2/24 h x 5). The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 21 and 31 months for the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., RESULTS: Grade 3-4 acute toxicity (RTOG) was observed in 73% and 36% of patients, and grade 3 dysphagia in 31% and 57% (P = 0.02) respectively in the RT and RT-CT groups. The rates of grade 3-4 late complications were similar in the two groups (5% vs. 12%). At three years, actuarial loco-regional control (LRC) was 57% and 66% (P = 0.66) and overall survival was 56% and 47% (P = 0.99) in the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., CONCLUSIONS: While acute toxicity was higher compared with RT alone, this accelerated RT schedule was feasible in association with 5-FU/CDDP, even administered concomitantly. Despite the significant proportion of more advanced disease in the RT-CT group, LRC was similar to that obtained by RT alone. Combinations of concomitant boost RT and chemotherapy merit further investigation in prospective trials.",Excluded

3333,"Ultraviolet polarisation sensitivity in the stomatopod crustacean Odontodactylus scyllarus The ommatidia of crustacean eyes typically contain two classes of photoreceptors with orthogonally oriented microvilli. These receptors provide the basis for two-channel polarisation vision in the blue-green spectrum. The retinae of gonodactyloid stomatopod crustaceans possess a great variety of structural specialisations for elaborate polarisation vision. One type of specialisation is found in the small, distally placed R8 cells within the two most ventral rows of the mid-band. These ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors produce parallel microvilli, a feature suggestive for polarisation-sensitive photoreceptors. Here, we show by means of intracellular recordings combined with dye-injections that in the gonodactyloid species Odontodactylus scyllarus, the R8 cells of mid-band rows 5 and 6 are sensitive to linear polarised ultraviolet light. We show that mid-band row 5 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented parallel to the mid-band, whereas mid-band row 6 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented perpendicular to the mid-band. This orthogonal arrangement of ultraviolet-sensitive receptor cells could support ultraviolet polarisation vision. R8 cells of rows 5 and 6 are known to act as quarter-wave retarders around 500 nm and thus are the first photoreceptor type described with a potential dual role in polarisation vision.",Excluded
1185,"Initial experience with stereotactic body radiotherapy for intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation BACKGROUND Graft hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplant is more frequently encountered. Graft hepatectomy is technically challenging and is associated with high morbidity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of primary HCC. However, its role in HCC recurrence in a liver graft remains unclear. AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of graft HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. From 2012 to 2018, 6 patients with intrahepatic HCC recurrence after liver transplant were treated with SBRT at Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong. The primary outcome was time to overall disease progression and secondary outcomes were time to local progression and best local response, as assessed with the Modified response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours criteria. Patients were monitored for treatment related toxicities and graft dysfunction. RESULTS A total of 9 treatment courses were given for 13 tumours. The median tumour size was 2.3 cm (range 0.7-3.6 cm). Two (22%) patients had inferior vena cava tumour thrombus. The best local treatment response was: 5 (55%) complete response, 1 (11%) partial response and 3 (33%) stable disease. After a median follow up duration of 15.5 mo, no local progression or mortality was yet observed. The median time to overall disease progression was 6.5 mo. There were 6 regional progression in the liver graft (67%) and 2 distant progression in the lung (22%). There was no grade 3 or above toxicity and there was no graft dysfunction after SBRT. CONCLUSION SBRT appears to be safe in this context. Regional progression is the mode of failure.Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

Quantitative comparison was made by calculating the mean SSDE, CTDIvol, contrast, noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both acquisitions. Two radiologists evaluated the chest SECT and DECT images qualitatively blinded to the technique used. The paired Student's t test was utilized for comparing the quantitative and qualitative data. Inter- and intraobserver agreement were also assessed., RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included. The mean SSDE, CTDIvol, contrast, noise, CNR, and SNR for SECT versus DECT were 12.7+/-2.2 mGy vs. 9.3+/-1.2 mGy (P = 0.001), 10.9+/-2.4 mGy vs. 8+/-1.2 mGy (P < 0.001), 211.9+/-44.7 vs. 216.3+/-59 (P = 0.350), 12.9+/-2.4 vs. 13.9+/-3.7 (P = 0.086), 13.5+/-5.2 vs. 13.3+/-8.4 (P = 0.548) and 12+/-3.5 vs. 11.5+/-3.4 (P = 0.774), respectively.

2355,"The complex relationship between lung tumor volume and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated by definitive radiotherapy: A prospective, observational prognostic factor study of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG 99.05) Background and purpose: To investigate the hypothesis that primary tumor volume is prognostic independent of T and N stages in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by definitive radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Multicenter prospective observational study. Patient eligibility: pathologically proven stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer planned for definitive radiotherapy (minimum 50 Gy in 20 fractions) using CT-based contouring. Volumes of the primary tumor and enlarged nodes were measured according to a standardized protocol. Survival was adjusted for the effect of T and N stage. Result(s): There were 509 eligible patients. Five-year survival rates for tumor volume grouped by quartiles were, for increasing tumor volume, 22%, 14%, 15% and 21%. Larger primary tumor volume was associated with shorter survival (HR = 1.060 (per doubling); 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.029). However, after adjusting for the effects of T and N stage, there was no evidence for an association (HR = 1.029, 95% CI, 0.96-1.10, P = 0.39). There was evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume was associated with an increased risk of dying, independently of T and N stage, in the first 18 months but not beyond. Conclusion(s): In patients treated by non-surgical means we were unable to show that lung tumor volume, overall, provides additional prognostic information beyond the T and N stage (TNM, 6th edition). There is evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume adversely affects outcome only within the first 18 months. Larger tumor size alone should not by itself exclude patients from curative (chemo)radiotherapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2052,"Correlation of bone mineral density with skeletal muscle content and physical activity BACKGROUND: Bone mineral density is the most important indicator for bone level. Osteoporosis is a worldwide problem, and there is no safe and effective radical treatment. It can only be prevented, so bone mineral density arise more attention. OBJECTIVE(S): To explore the relationship between skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and bone mineral density in older adults, so as to provide theoretical basis for preventing osteoporosis treatment. METHOD(S): Totally 111 subjects aged 40 to 84 years were recruited randomly. The bone mineral density was measured by double energy X-Ray bone density meter, and the human skeletal muscle content, fat content and percentage of skeletal muscle were measured by human body component analyzer. The variance analysis was used for multiple group comparisons in different age groups, LSD method for comparisons between groups, and Pearson correlation analysis for correlation analysis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION(S): Bone mineral density was significantly related to the physical activity, body mass, and skeletal muscle content (r=0.30, 0.41, and 0.45, P < 0.01). For middle and older adults, skeletal muscle content, physical activity level and body mass were positively related to bone mineral density. Age and bone mineral density had a negative relationship. These results indicate that physical activity is an important factor affecting bone density, and higher level of physical activity is beneficial to maintain and improve bone mineral density. Increasing muscle mass and improving body composition can improve bone mineral density.Copyright © 2018, Journal of Clinical Rehabilitative Tissue Engineering Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1194,"Chronic bronchitis in the cohort of Mayak workers first employed 1948-1958 Incidence of chronic bronchitis has been studied in a cohort of 12,210 workers first employed at one of the main plants of the Mayak nuclear facility during 1948-1958 and followed up to 31 December 2005. Information on external gamma doses is available for virtually all of these workers; in contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30% of workers. During the follow-up period in the study cohort 1,175 incident cases of chronic bronchitis were verified. The analyses of nonradiation factors revealed that the underlying risk of chronic bronchitis incidence increased with increasing attained age and was higher among smokers compared with never-smokers as would be expected. The most interesting finding in relationship to nonradiation factors was a sharp increase in the baseline chronic bronchitis risk before 1960. The cause of this is not clear but a number of factors may play a role. Based on the follow-up data after 1960, the analysis showed a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with cumulative external gamma-ray dose (ERR/Gy = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01, 0.32). Based on the same subset but with an additional restriction to members with cumulative internal lung dose below 1 Gy, a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with internal alpha-radiation lung dose from incorporated plutonium was found (ERR/Gy = 2.70, 95% CI 1.20, 4.87). In both cases, adjustment was made for nonradiation factors, including smoking and either internal or external dose as appropriate. At present there are no similar incidence studies with which to compare results. However, the most recent data from the atomic bomb survivor cohort (the Life Span Study) showed statistically significant excess mortality risk for respiratory diseases of 22% per Gy and this value is within the confidence bounds of the point estimate of the risk from this study in relation to external dose.",Excluded

1833,"Neuropathology of intracranial arteriovenous malformations following conventional radiation therapy Conventional fractionated radiation therapy was used in 15 patients to treat arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the brain deemed inoperable or incompletely obliterated using endovascular or surgical techniques. The AVMs measured from 0.8 to 85 cm3 (mean 28.2 cm3; median 24 cm3). Angiography in 12 patients 1-21 years following radiation therapy demonstrated no significant change in 7, slight reduction in 2, near complete obliteration in 1, and complete obliteration in 2. Magnetic resonance imaging further demonstrated apparent obliteration in one other case. Three irradiated AVMs were available for pathological examination following fatal recurrent hemorrhage after 21 years in case 1 and following surgery after 5 years in cases 2 and 3. Doses of 20 and 45 Gy were delivered to the area of the AVM in 10 and 15 fractions with a 6-MV linear accelerator in case 1 and in cases 2 and 3, respectively. A blinded histopathological comparison was made of the latter cases and three AVMs removed at surgery that were not previously irradiated and that were comparable in size, number of arterial feeders, and location within the brain. Segmental hyalinization of some blood vessels was seen in both irradiated and nonirradiated cases. The single postmortem specimen showed extensive thrombosis but a patent nidus. The findings are in keeping with the clinical impression that conventional fractionated radiation therapy fails to alter the natural history of cerebral AVMs. The favorable outcome of radiosurgery on small- to medium-sized AVMs appears attributable to the shorter duration of therapy using relatively high-dose prescriptions to the nidus.",Excluded

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) for HCCCL. Method(s): Patients with HCCCL treated with C-ion RT at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2018 were evaluated. The total dose was 52.8 or 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in four or 12 fractions depending on the distance between the tumor and the gastrointestinal tract. The survival outcome, the presence or absence of recurrence (local recurrence, intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field, or extrahepatic recurrence), and acute/late adverse events were evaluated. Result(s): Nine patients were included. The median tumor size was 3.4 cm, and the median follow-up duration was 18.3 months for all patients. No patient developed local recurrence during follow-up. Five patients subsequently developed intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field and two had extrahepatic metastasis. Five patients died of hepatocellular carcinoma. No acute adverse events of grade >=2 were observed. Two patients experienced grade 2 or 3 late adverse events, including obstructive jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and edema.

1560,"The effects of stimulation frequency and fatigue on the force-intensity relationship for human skeletal muscle OBJECTIVE: Functional electrical stimulation (FES) has not gained widespread application for a number of factors; two of which are rapid muscle fatigue and imprecise control in force. Stimulation intensity is adjusted during FES to overcome the decline in muscle force due to fatigue and precisely control muscle force output. The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between muscle force output and stimulation intensity and to see how this relationship changes with fatigue., METHODS: Quadriceps femoris muscles of 10 able-bodied adults were tested isometrically. Pre- and post-fatigue muscle force responses to stimulation trains with different intensities and frequencies were recorded and analyzed. In addition, a case study using a subject with spinal cord injury was presented to illustrate the use of the force-intensity relationship to reduce muscle fatigue and improve the control of muscle force during repetitive electrical stimulation., RESULTS: An exponential relationship between muscle force and stimulation intensity was observed; interestingly, the normalized force-intensity relationship did not change with stimulation frequency or fatigue., CONCLUSIONS: The observed consistencies in the force-intensity relationship should assist scientists and clinicians to more accurately predict the forces produced by a muscle with changes in pulse duration during repetitive electrical stimulation., SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this study provide guidelines for clinicians and researchers to adjust the stimulation intensity to achieve precise control of force repetitively during the application of FES.",Excluded
1101,"Magnitude of luminance modulation specifies amplitude of perceived movement A compelling impression of movement, which is perceptually indistinguishable from a real displacement, can be elicited by patterns containing no spatially displaced elements. An apparent oscillation, w-movement, was generated by a stationary pattern containing a large number of horizontal pairs of spatially adjacent dots modulated in brightness. The observer's task was to adjust the perceived amplitude of the w-motion to match the amplitude of a real oscillation. All of the data can be accounted for by a simple rule: If the relative change in the luminance, W = delta L/L, between two adjacent stationary dots is kept constant, the distance over which these dots appeared to travel in space comprises a fixed fraction of the total distance by which they are separated. The apparent amplitude of the w-motion increases strictly in proportion with luminance contrast, provided that the contrast is represented in the motion-encoding system by a rapidly saturating compressive Weibull transformation. These findings can be explained in terms of bilocal motion encoders comparing two luminance modulations occurring at two different locations.",Excluded
2460,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded
710,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1 +/- 150.5 mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2 +/- 204.6 mSv and 150.5 +/- 211.2 mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133 , rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Included
309,"Treatment outcomes of T4 locally advanced head and neck cancers with soft tissue invasion or bone and cartilage invasion PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S):: T4 locally advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) with bone and cartilage invasion (BCI) traditionally have been treated with resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Standard- and reduced-dose chest CT (60 and 250 mA) and MR imaging with UTE were used to examine 52 patients; 29 were men (mean age, 66.4 years +/- 7.3 [standard deviation]; age range, 48-79 years) and 23 were women (mean age, 64.8 years +/- 10.1; age range, 42-83 years). Probability of nodule presence was assessed for all methods with a five-point visual scoring system. All nodules were then classified as missed, ground-glass, part-solid, or solid nodules. To compare nodule detection capability of the three methods, consensus for performances was rated by using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, and kappa analysis was used to compare intermethod agreement for nodule type classification. Results There was no significant difference (F = 0.70, P = .59) in figure of merit between methods (standard-dose CT, 0.86; reduced-dose CT, 0.84; MR imaging with UTE, 0.86). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between methods (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, P = .50; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P = .50; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P >.99). Intermethod agreement was excellent (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.99, P < .001). Conclusion Pulmonary thin-section MR imaging with UTE was useful in nodule detection and evaluation of nodule type, and it is considered at least as efficacious as standard- or reduced-dose thin-section CT. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded

Radiographic knee osteoarthritis (ROA) was measured using x-ray. Multi-site pain (MSP) was defined as NPS >=2. Persistent pain was defined as having knee pain or MSP at all time-points. Multivariable mixed-effects models and log-binomial regression were applied for the analyses. Result(s): Sleep disturbance was associated with greater knee pain severity (beta 0.91, 95%CI 0.70-1.11) and higher risk of having more NPS [(Relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95%CI 1.07-1.14] in a dose-response manner in multivariable analyse with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, comorbidities, pain medications, ever smoking, emotional problems, employment, and education level. Persistent sleep disturbance was associated with a greater risk of persistent knee pain (RR 1.90, 1.26-2.87) and MSP (RR 1.29, 1.07-1.56). In participants with ROA, results were similar apart from the link between sleep disturbance and persistent pain. pain. Conclusion(s): Sleep disturbance was independently associated with greater pain severity and significantly increases risk for MSP with a long-term effect of sleep on pain in general and ROA population, suggesting beneficial effects of treating sleep problems on long-term pain control.",Excluded
1458,"DNA Damage Baseline Predicts Resilience to Space Radiation and Radiotherapy Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included
2280,"Intramedullary locked nailing for extraarticular fracturues of the distal radius. 2 years results of a aprospective randomized trial in comparison to palmar locked plating Aim: This study compares angular stable intramedullary nailing with volar plating for the treatment of displaced fractures of the distal radius. Material(s) and Method(s): In a prospective randomized trial patients with extraarticular fractures of the distal radius (AO 23 A3) were randomly assigned to receive either palmar plating (PP) (2.4mm, Synthes, USA) or intramedullary nailing (TDR) (Targon DR, Aesculap, Germany). Follow up examinations were performed 8 weeks and 2 years post surgery. Result(s): 152 patients (129 female and 23 male, mean age 62.9+/-15.6 years) were included and randomly assigned to receive either PP (n = 72) or TDR (n = 80). Complete clinical and radiological follow up was obtained in 122 patients. All fractures united. The mean palmar tilt was 2.2degree for palmar plating and 2.9degree for intramedullary nailing. Significant differences within groups (p < 0.05, students-t-test, posthoc: Bonferroni) were recorded for time for surgery (Targon DR: 41+/-21 min; 2.4mm plate: 51+/-18 min) for x-ray time (Targon DR: 1.2+/-0.3 min; 2.4mm plate: 0.9+/-0.2 min) as well as for early pain and motor function (Targon DR: VAS 1.2+/-0.2, Ext./Flex. 82%; 2.4mm plate: VAS 1.6+/-0.4, Ext./Flex. 76%). No differences were seen after two years. Osteopenic bone loss as measured by pQCT was seen in 73% of cases and qualitiy of life assessment (SF 36) revealed excellent social and physical function without differences within groups. Complications were CTS (4 PP, 2 TDR), temp. paresthesia of the superficial n. radialis branch (2 TDR), screw overlength (n = 2 PP, n = 2 TDR), intraarticular screw location (n = 2 PP) or extensor tendon affection (n = 4 PP). Conclusion(s): Intramedullary nailing for distal radial fractures is advantageous in terms of pain reduction and early motion when compared to volar plating. The late functional results of both techniques are comparable as well as the fixation stability in osteoporotic fractures.",Excluded
3291,"Repeat Gamma Knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: long-term results The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcome achieved after repeat Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) using a uniform treatment plan. Between 1985 and 2010, 53 patients underwent repeat GKS for refractory TN. In the initial GKS, which involved targeting the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, a maximal dose of 80 Gy was used with a 4-mm collimator so that the 50% isodose line abutted the pons. In the second GKS, the treatment plan consisted of a 70-Gy dose directed at a target 4-5 mm distal to the first target on the trigeminal nerve. The mean follow-up duration in these patients was 42 months. Outcomes were defined using the Marseille scale: excellent (Class I or II, no pain with or without medications), good (Class III or IV, >= 50% relief), and poor (Class V, < 50% relief). Trigeminal neuralgia pain was controlled (>= 50% improvement with or without medications) after repeat GKS in 70% of patients at 1 year, 50% at 3 years, 50% at 5 years, and 50% at 10 years, as defined by a Kaplan-Meier analysis. A correlation was found between facial numbness and pain relief (p = 0.047). No difference was found between patients with Type 1 TN and those with Type 2 TN, and there was no correlation between the best relief obtained and long-term durability of relief from pain. Twenty-two patients (47.8%) described their trigeminal dysfunction in the following manner: numbness (45.6%), dry eye (10.9%), taste change (8.7%), or jaw weakness (2.2%). In only 8.7% of cases did the patient experience facial numbness that was regarded as bothersome. Repeat GKS for TN at the doses used provides substantial long-term relief. Treatment failure occurred up to 28 months after the second GKS. Facial numbness correlated with more durable pain relief after repeat GKS in this series.",Excluded
650,"Gender difference in the development of ischemic heart disease in emergency workers of the Chernobyl accident Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0). It was shown that 25% of all male EW developed IHD in 11.7+/-0.5 years after irradiation, while the same number of EW-women after 15.5+/-1.3 years. Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included
193,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included
1068,"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cutaneous radiation syndrome Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery. Detailed understanding of underlying diseases and rational reconstructive procedures brings about good outcomes for difficult irradiated wound healing. Adipose-derived stem cells are also implicated in the limited local injuries for short cell harvesting and processing time in the same subject. Copyright © 2010 Health Physics Society.",Included
1893,"Risk of cancer associated with low-dose radiation exposure: comparison of results between the INWORKS nuclear workers study and the A-bomb survivors study The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS. These findings from different study populations may help understanding of radiation risks, with INWORKS contributing information derived from cohorts of workers with protracted low dose-rate exposures.",Included
3249,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

462,"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and early vascular aging from long-term low-dose ionizing radiation exposure: a genetic, telomere, and vascular ultrasound study in cardiac catheterization laboratory staff OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis.",Included
876,"A questionnaire study to derive information on the working environment, clinical training, use of ancillary staff and optimization of patient radiation dose within UK dental practice Aim To evaluate the working environment of GDPs and Endodontists and the methods used to optimize patient radiation dose.

The responders, 603 of the former and 132 of the latter, completed a questionnaire covering practitioner demographics, pattern of practice, the use of radiographic techniques and the optimization of dose. Chi-squared tests were used to compare groups at the P=0.05 level of significance. For nonparametric data, the Mann-Whitney U-test was employed. Results A response rate of 73% was achieved. Overall, 79.5% of endodontic specialists used film holders compared with 65.9% of GDPs (P=0.001). One hundred and thirty (98.5%) endodontists and 581 (96.3%) GDPs reported that they were well prepared or adequately prepared in radiographically assessing the presence of apical pathosis. The study found significant differences (P<0.001) between the use of digital radiography by specialist endodontists 93 (70.5%) compared with general dental practitioners 167 (27.7%). Significant differences (P=0.004) were also observed in the use of rectangular collimation between endodontic specialists 55 (42%) and GDPs 223 (37%). With regard to the use of film holders in diagnostic radiography, 105 (79.5%) of endodontic specialists employed these devices compared with 396 (65.7%) GDPs; this finding was significant (P=0.005).

894,"Usefulness of additional coronary calcium scoring in low-dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering impact on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of additional coronary calcium scoring on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy of low-dose computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients underwent 64-slice CTCA using prospective ECG triggering, calcium scoring, and invasive quantitative coronary angiography, the latter served as standard of reference. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for CTCA, calcium scoring, and for the combination of both. Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to determine cutoffs for prediction of significant coronary artery stenoses., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose was 2.1 + or - 0.7 mSv (range, 1.0-3.3 mSv) for CTCA and 1.1 + or - 0.1 mSv (range, 0.9-1.4 mSv) for calcium scoring. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 85.7%, 89.2%, and 100% for CTCA, and 72.7%, 82.1%, 82.8%, and 71.9% for calcium scoring. Adding calcium-scoring with a cutoff at 133 in patients aged >50.7 years with nondiagnostic CTCA improved the respective values of diagnostic accuracy of the entire study population to 100%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 100%; the added value of calcium scoring was confined to only three patients (5%), who were reclassified from false positive to true negative., CONCLUSION: Specificity and PPV of low-dose CTCA may be further improved by combining it with coronary calcium scoring. However, only a fraction of patient may benefit, whereas exposing the entire population to more than 50% increase in effective radiation dose. Copyright 2010 AUR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

356,"Increased circulating cell-free DNA levels and mtDNA fragments in interventional cardiologists occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) and mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) have often been used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in acute and chronic disorders, but little is known about changes in ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA concentrations following radiation exposure. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR. No significant relationships were found between ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA, and age, gender, smoking, or other clinical parameters. Ccf-DNA levels (44.2 +/- 31.1 vs. 30.6 +/- 19.2 ng/ml, P = 0.013), ccf-mtDNA-79 (2.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and ccf-mtDNA-230 copies (2.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in interventional cardiologists compared with the non-exposed group. In a subset (n = 15) of interventional cardiologists with a reliable reconstruction of cumulative professional exposure (59.7 +/- 48.4 mSv; range: 1.4-182 mS), ccf-DNA (53.2 +/- 41.3 vs. 36.4 +/- 22.9 and 32.2 +/- 20.5, P = 0.08), mtDNA-79 (2.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.03 +/- 1.7 and 1.09 +/- 0.82, P = 0.05), and mtDNA-230 (2.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.4 and 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.09) tended to be significantly increased in high-exposure subjects compared with both low-exposure interventional cardiologists and controls. Our results provide evidence for a possible role of circulating DNA as a relevant biomarker of cellular damage induced by exposure to chronic low-dose radiation.

228,"Adaptation to motion sickness from torso rotation affects symptoms from supine head nodding INTRODUCTION: Space motion sickness affects more than 50% of astronauts. Adaptation to one kind of nauseogenic motion can affect the response to another. We hypothesized that repeated exposure to torso rotation (TR) would diminish motion sickness (MS) due to supine head nodding (HN), a ground-based analogue for space sickness., METHODS: During TR, standing subjects swept their gaze back and forth between two targets located 135 degrees to either side of straight ahead. For HN, the subject lay supine on a platform with his/her head and neck hanging over the edge. The head was pitched back and forth between the horizontal position and rotated back as far as possible. MS was quantified in 5 male and 20 female subjects using numerical estimates of discomfort and a more detailed questionnaire. Susceptibility to TR and HN was determined on three occasions for each stimulus. At least 1 mo separated any two tests. Subjects were exposed to TR once a day for 7 consecutive days 1 mo after the final control session. Within 24 h of the seventh session, and 1 mo later, susceptibility to HN was evaluated again., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in MS susceptibility during repeated exposure to TR (time to stop 17.7 min on Day 1, 31.8 min on Day 7). In contrast, there was a significant increase in MS susceptibility to HN after repeated exposure to TR (mean time to stop 11.7 min before TR, 9.5 min after). Susceptibility to HN was back to normal (time to stop 11.4 min) 1 mo later., DISCUSSION: Subjects can adapt to TR by repeated exposure. At the same time, susceptibility to HN increases. Strategies for pre-adaptation to space motion sickness need to be chosen carefully as they could actually be counterproductive.",Excluded

In this study, we investigated the prognosis of AA with radiologic necrosis which is the representative radiologic finding of glioblastoma. From 1995 to 2010, we operated on 26 patients who were confirmed to have AA. The male:female ratio was 13:13, and the median age was 47.23 years. The mean follow-up period was 3 years. We analyzed the prognostic significance of radiologic necrosis with age, sex, KPS, tumour location, radiologic findings, extent of removal and radiation therapy oncology group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG-RPA) classification. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.5 (+/-0.17) years and the median overall survival (OS) was 1.6 (+/-0.40) years. In univariate analysis, the clinical variables of younger age (p = 0.030) and RTOG-RPA class III (p = 0.043) correlated with longer PFS, and KPS (p = 0.038), radiologic necrosis (p = 0.013) and the extent of removal (p = 0.041) correlated with OS. The median OS was 1.0 (+/-0.21) year in AA with radiologic necrosis compared to AA without radiologic necrosis, which showed 2.1 (+/-0.29) years median OS. On multivariate analysis, there was no statistically significant prognostic factor. However, Cox's regression model revealed that gross total removal was associated with a longer OS (hazard ratio =0.136; 95% CI, 0.018 to 1.046; p = 0.055) compared to partial removal or biopsy.

1245,"Effects of parental radiation exposure on developmental instability in grasshoppers Mutagenic and epigenetic effects of environmental stressors and their transgenerational consequences are of interest to evolutionary biologists because they can amplify natural genetic variation. We studied the effect of parental exposure to radioactive contamination on offspring development in lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus. We used a geometric morphometric approach to measure fluctuating asymmetry (FA), wing shape and wing size. We measured time to sexual maturity to check whether parental exposure to radiation influenced offspring developmental trajectory and tested effects of radiation on hatching success and parental fecundity. Wings were larger in early maturing individuals born to parents from high radiation sites compared to early maturing individuals from low radiation sites. As time to sexual maturity increased, wing size decreased but more sharply in individuals from high radiation sites. Radiation exposure did not significantly affect FA or shape in wings nor did it significantly affect hatching success and fecundity. Overall, parental radiation exposure can adversely affect offspring development and fitness depending on developmental trajectories although the cause of this effect remains unclear. We suggest more direct measures of fitness and the inclusion of replication in future studies to help further our understanding of the relationship between developmental instability, fitness and environmental stress.

Background(s): Routine cath prior to Fontan has been utilized for years; noninvasive methods, however, may be sufficient. Method(s): This study reviews clinical data in 119 consecutive patients investigating 3 groups: those who underwent CMR alone (MR; n = 41), cath alone (C; n = 41), or both cath and CMR (C+M; n = 37) prior to Fontan. Result(s): No clinically significant differences were noted in patient characteristics, hemodynamics, or clinical status prior to or after surgery between the C and MR groups. CMR added information in 82%. There were no discrepant findings between CMR and cath data in the C+M group. Diagnostic success was <95% in all groups. Of those undergoing Fontan completion, the C+M group had similar outcomes to C and MR; C and CMR were utilized in combination to assess aortopulmonary collaterals or the need for an intervention or evaluate its success. Echo could not delineate pulmonary arterial anatomy in 46% to 53% of patients. The C+M and C groups were exposed to 6.8 +/- 4.1 mSv of radiation. Conclusion(s): Single ventricle patients not requiring an intervention can undergo successful Fontan completion with CMR and echo alone with similar short-term outcomes to C, which was used as a control, preventing an invasive test and exposure to radiation. CMR can add information in a significant number of patients. Cath and CMR are utilized together for interventions and assessment of aortopulmonary collaterals. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
901,"[Risk factors prevalence for cardiovascular diseases among atomic power industry enterprises personnel] UNLABELLED: A selective cross-sectional study based on Regional Medico-Dosimetric Register was carried out in some Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE) workers (aged 40-50) with the aim of studying the most important risk factors prevalence for cardiovascular diseases development. 2010 persons examined with the use of standardized epidemiological methods made up 32.6% of total SGCE personnel aged 40-50., PURPOSE: the study of risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, their prevalence, intensity and significance in atomic power plants workers exposed to occupational long-term ionizing radiation in a low"" dose range (cumulative doses in the range up to 1 Sv). The study of prevalence of risk factors for CVDs development in men occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation revealed frequent changes in the type of work performed, higher levels of psychoemotional tension, as well as high prevalence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) and obesity. Women workers of the main production were found to have hypercholesterolaemia more often than those of the auxiliary production. Annual health checks of nuclear workers should be extended to include waist and hips measurement, body mass index (BMI) calculation, lipid factors evaluation, as well as stress tests (bicycle and/or stress echocardiography) in case there are three or more risk factors for CVDs for workers of the main production.""",Included
160,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer in British Columbia 1985-1999: A population-based study Aims: To review the outcome of patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in British Columbia between January 1985 and December 1999. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-five patients were identified. Survival curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the charts of the 62 patients referred to a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) facility were reviewed. Result(s): All cases: 51 out of 75 patients (68%) were women; median age of all patients was 74 years. The overall- and cancer-specific 5-year survival rates for the whole group were 5%. Non-referred cases: nine out of 13 patients were women; median age at diagnosis 84 years. Eleven of the 13 patients died within 1 month of diagnosis. Referred cases: 42 out of 62 patients were women; median age 72 years; median survival 5.1 months; 1-year survival 19%. Forty-eight patients presented with tumours that extended through the thyroid capsule, 10 presented with distant metastases. Four patients had a total thyroidectomy, nine a partial thyroidectomy, and 49 a biopsy only. Fifty-seven patients received radiotherapy, nine of these had concurrent chemotherapy: Thirty-three patients received less than 40 Gy and 24 patients received 40 Gy or more. Median survival was longer (9 vs 3 months) in patients receiving 40 Gy or more; this group included four patients who had prolonged survival. Conclusion(s): Long-term, disease-free survival was achieved in a few patients who were able to receive high-dose radiotherapy, preferably after adequate surgery. © 2005 The Royal College of Radiologists.

384,"CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas Objective. Hemangiopericytoma is a rare and aggressive meningeal tumor. Although surgical resection is the standard treatment, hemangiopericytomas often recur with high incidences of metastasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (CK) in the management of recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. Methods. In a review of the Stanford radiosurgery database between 2002 and 2009, the authors found 14 patients who underwent CK therapy for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. A total of 24 tumors were treated and the median patient age was 52 years (range 29-70 years) at the time of initial CK therapy. The median follow-up period was 37 months (10-73 months) and all patients had been previously treated with surgical resection. Mean tumor volume was 9.16 cm3 and the mean marginal and maximum radiosurgical doses to the tumors were 21.2 Gy and 26.8 Gy, respectively. Result(s): Of the 24 tumors treated, 22 have clinical follow-up data at this time. Of those 22 tumors, 12 decreased in size (54.5%), 6 remained unchanged (27.3%), and 4 showed recurrence (18.2%) after CK therapy. Progression-free survival rate was 95%, 71.5%, and 71.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after multiple CK treatments. The 5-year survival rate after CK was 81%. Conclusion(s): CK is an effective and safe management option for hemangiopericytomas. The current series demonstrates a tumor control of 81.8%. Other institutions have demonstrated similar outcomes with stereotactic radiosurgery, with tumor control ranging from 46.4% to 100%. © 2011 Veeravagu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
277,"Intestinal and colonic motor alterations associated with irradiation-induced diarrhoea in rats Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included
1140,"The influence of ventilatory disorders and clinical status on the early and late prognosis in patients with recent chronic heart failure exacerbation Purpose: The aims of the study were to assess: the prevalence of ventilatory disorders in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, the correlation with clinical status and impact on prognosis. Method(s): There were 25 patients-22 (88%) men and 3 (12%) women (60+/-13 years) with decompensated CHF recruited for the study. All patients underwent following examinations: medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (repeated on the lung function tests day), 12-leads electrocardiogram, X-ray, echocardiogram. The spirometry and body plethysmography were performed after patient's clinical haemodynamic stabilization. The following lung function tests parameters were taken into analysis: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), Tiffeneau ratio -FEV1 %VCmax (Maximal Vital Capacity), total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), total airway resistance (Rtot). All examinations were repeated 3 months after the discharge. The median follow-up was 61 months. The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney-U test, chi2 test and Pearson correlation were used for the initial statistical analysis. Result(s): The ejection fraction (EF) <=35% (21,1%+/-7,42) was confirmed in all patients on admission and 3 months after the discharge (23,3+/-8%, p=0,05). The elevated BNP level (2131,3+/-1096,8 pg/ml) was revealed in all patients on admission. Both BNP levels after stabilization (1192,4+/-1070,8 pg/ml) and 3 months after the discharge (745,7+/-635pg/ml) were lower than initial (p<0,0001). The spirometry revealed obstructive disorders in 20 patients (80%) at the discharge and 3 months later. The body plethysmography confirmed restrictive disorders in 2 patients (8%) at the discharge. We revealed the significant correlations between FEV1%VCmax and the highest BNP level (r=-0,45, p=0,027 ) and BNP level on lung function tests day (r=-0,44, p=0,03). We also found negative relationships between: EF and FEV1 (r=-0,41, p=0,04), EF and TLC (r=-0,59, p=0,007), EF and FEV1 measured 3 months after the discharge (r=-0,45, p=0,04). The mortality rate achieved 44% in 3 and 52% in 5 year follow-up. There was a significant correlation between BNP level at the discharge (p<0,01), EF measured 3 months later (p=0,02) and death in 3 year follow-up period. Conclusion(s): Ventilatory disorders appeared in the majority of patients with CHF exacerbation and 3 months after this episode. There is a significant correlation between maximal BNP level, BNP after the stabilization and FEV1 % VCmax. There were no correlations between lung function tests parameters and mortality in early and late follow-up in this group of patients.",Excluded
3219,"Three-dimensional conformal versus non-graphic radiation treatment planning for apocrine gland adenocarcinoma of the anal sac in 18 dogs (2002-2007) Differences in dose homogeneity and irradiated volumes of target and surrounding normal tissues between 3D conformal radiation treatment planning and simulated non-graphic manual treatment planning were evaluated in 18 dogs with apocrine gland adenocarcinoma of the anal sac. Overall, 3D conformal treatment planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution to target tissues with lower hot spots and dose ranges. Dose homogeneity and guarantee of not under-dosing target tissues with 3D conformal planning came at the cost, however, of delivering greater mean doses of radiation and of irradiating greater volumes of surrounding normal tissue structures.

2175,"Statistical modeling of carcinogenic risks in dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 Combined analyses of data on 260 life-span beagle dogs that inhaled 238PuO2 at the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI) and at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) were conducted. The hazard functions (age-specific risks) for incidence of lung, bone and liver tumors were modeled as a function of cumulative radiation dose, and estimates of lifetime risks based on the combined data were developed. For lung tumors, linear-quadratic functions provided an adequate fit to the data from both laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit when analyses were restricted to doses less than 20 Gy. The estimated risk coefficients for these functions were significantly larger when based on ITRI data compared to PNNL data, and dosimetry biases are a possible explanation for this difference. There was also evidence that the bone tumor response functions differed for the two laboratories, although these differences occurred primarily at high doses. These functions were clearly nonlinear (even when restricted to average skeletal doses less than 1 Gy), and evidence of radiation-induced bone tumors was found for doses less than 0.5 Gy in both laboratories. Liver tumor risks were similar for the two laboratories, and linear functions provided an adequate fit to these data. Lifetime risk estimates for lung and bone tumors derived from these data had wide confidence intervals, but were consistent with estimates currently used in radiation protection. The dog-based lifetime liver tumor risk estimate was an order of magnitude larger than that used in radiation protection, but the latter also carries large uncertainties. The application of common statistical methodology to data from two studies has allowed the identification of differences in these studies and has provided a basis for common risk estimates based on both data sets.",Excluded
399,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded
30,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

1896,"A Prospective Trial of Radiation Therapy Efficacy and Toxicity for Localized Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma Purpose: We report the long-term results of a prospective trial conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of radiation therapy (RT) alone in treating localized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Patients with localized MALT lymphoma were eligible and treated with involved field RT to doses of 24 to 39.6 Gy. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate RFS, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) defined from time of study entry. Preplanned subgroup analyses were performed based on site of involvement. Result(s): From 2000 to 2012, 75 patients were accrued; 73 received protocol-specified RT. Median follow-up was 9.8 years. Thirty-four patients had gastric MALT, 17 orbital, 13 head and neck nonorbit, 4 skin, and 5 disease of other sites. Thirteen of 34 patients with gastric MALT were Helicobacter pylori positive at the time of initial diagnosis and underwent 1 to 3 courses of triple antibiotic therapy. All gastric MALT patients had documented persistent MALT without H. pylori on endoscopy before enrollment in the study. All patients achieved a complete response with a median time of 3 months. Eleven patients (15%) had disease relapse, 9 of which were at sites outside the RT field with median time to progression of 38.3 months. Median PFS was 17.5 years, and median RFS and OS were not reached. The 10-year relapse-free rate was 83% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74%-93%). The 10-year PFS rate was 71% (95% CI, 60%-84%). The 10-year OS rate was 86% (95% CI, 77%-96%). RFS, PFS, and OS did not differ by disease site (P = .17,. 43, and. 50, respectively). All relapses were successfully salvaged. One patient developed metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma and was found to also have recurrent MALT on biopsy. Otherwise, all relapsed patients were alive without evidence of disease at last follow-up, and no patient died of MALT lymphoma. Sixty-seven patients (92%) experienced acute toxicity during radiation, all of which were grade 1 and 2, with only 1 grade 3 toxicity. Twenty-two patients (30%) experienced late toxicity, with only 1 grade 3 toxicity. Conclusion(s): This prospective study confirms that RT for MALT lymphoma provides excellent long-term RFS with acceptable rates of toxicity. Current efforts are focused on RT de-escalation in an effort to further avoid treatment-related morbidity. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04465162.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
1287,"Intraluminal high-dose-rate brachytherapy for palliation of dysphagia in cancer of the esophagus: Initial experience at a single UK center Esophageal cancer tends to present with advanced disease, and the majority of patients are suitable only for palliative treatment at diagnosis. Dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom and significantly undermines quality of life. High-dose-rate intraluminal brachytherapy (ILBT) has been an option for the palliation of dysphagia for many years and has been used at our center since 2006. Experience was presented in terms of improvement of dysphagia and survival. Patients were identified from the local radiotherapy database. Original treatment sheets and clinical notes were reviewed retrospectively to obtain treatment details, pretreatment and post-treatment dysphagia scores, and survival information. Between January 2006 and January 2010, 21 patients of median age 77 years with a mean pretreatment dysphagia score of 2.5 underwent ILBT for esophageal cancer. All received 12Gy in a single fraction. Thirteen (62%) had adenocarcinoma and eight (38%) squamous cell carcinoma. Four (19%) tumors were in the mid-esophagus and 17 (81%) in the lower esophagus. Eight had extension of tumor into the gastroesophageal junction. Seven patients (33%) received chemotherapy as first-line treatment prior to brachytherapy. Nineteen patients had clear documentation of dysphagia scores both pretreatment and post-treatment, and the improvement overall was significant (P= 0.04). Ten patients (53%) had an improvement in dysphagia score. Five of these (50%) went on to require further endoscopic intervention due to disease progression. Median duration of response was 4 months. Of the nonresponders, six (67%) went on to require further endoscopic intervention. No patients experienced documented toxicity aside from a short-lived acute esophagitis. Median survival from date of diagnosis was 12 months and from treatment date was 5 months (1-32 months). In our series of elderly patients with significant dysphagia, ILBT was a well-tolerated and effective treatment. It should be considered as a palliative option in esophageal cancer. © 2012, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2754,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded
1302,"Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma to manage seizures; preclinical studies suggest that it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for glioblastoma was associated with overall survival by retrospective multivariable analysis in a large cohort. The results suggest that HDAC inhibitors, like VA, may improve the results of RT and should be subjected to clinical trials. Purpose(s): Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS). Methods and Materials: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS. Result(s): Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA. Median OS in patients taking VA was 16.9 months (vs 13.6 months taking another AED, P=.16). Among patients taking an AED during RT, OS was associated with VA (P=.047; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.07), and RTOG RPA class (P<.0001; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.37-1.61). Of the 5 most common AEDs, only VAwas associated with OS. Median OS of patients receiving VA and TMZ during RT was 23.9 months (vs 15.2 months for patients taking another AED, P=.26). When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Conclusion(s): VA use during RT for GB was associated with improved OS, independently of RTOG RPA, seizure history, and concurrent TMZ use. Further studies of treatment that combines HDAC inhibitors and RT are warranted. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2751,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
627,"Solitary pulmonary nodule: Characterization with combined wash-in and washout features at dynamic multi-detector row CT PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the accuracy of combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) in distinguishing benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively. Of 58 benign nodules, 27 showed less than 25 HU wash-in, 14 showed persistent contrast enhancement without washout and with wash-in of 25 HU or greater, and 11 showed washout greater than 31 HU and wash-in of 25 HU or greater. CONCLUSION(S): Evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules by analyzing combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT showed 92% accuracy for distinguishing benign nodules from malignant nodules. © RSNA, 2005.",Excluded
594,"Myocardial infarction mortality risk after treatment for hodgkin disease: A collaborative British cohort study Background Myocardial infarction is a major cause of excess long-term mortality in survivors of Hodgkin disease, but limited information exists on the effects of specific chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients on their risk of death from myocardial infarction. Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded
1841,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective? BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included

951,"Clinical trial of post-chemotherapy consolidation thoracic radiotherapy for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer Background and purpose: To define the rate of development of symptomatic chest failures in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) after undergoing post-chemotherapy chest radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): Patients had ES-SCLC, attained an objective response to chemotherapy and signed study consent. Target accrual was 33 patients. Patients were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) as per department policy. PCI (25 Gy/10 fractions) and chest RT (40 Gy/15 fractions) were given simultaneously 4-8 weeks after chemotherapy completion. Thoracic target volume was the post-chemotherapy residual chest disease plus margin. Patients were evaluated for RT toxicities, local control, disease-free and overall survival. Result(s): Thirty-two patients were evaluable. Twenty-nine patients completed RT without delay. There were 4 complete responses and 28 partial responses to chemotherapy. All study patients received PCI. Maximal acute RT toxicity was grade 2 esophagitis (18 patients). There were no RT-related deaths. Median time to disease progression and overall survival were 4.2 and 8.3 months, respectively (median follow-up = 21.8 months). Of 16 chest recurrences, 7 were in the irradiated region and 5 were symptomatic. Conclusion(s): Post-chemotherapy consolidation chest RT for ES-SCLC patients on this trial was well tolerated and associated with symptomatic chest recurrences in only 5/32 treated patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2982,"Flow cytometry-based assay for determination of teleost cytotoxic cell lysis of target cells BACKGROUND: The nonradiometric assays previously developed to detect cellular cytotoxic activity have been hindered by many difficulties. Among the problems are the requirement for expensive commercial kits and the use of techniques that produce high background noise and decreased sensitivity. In addition, these assays did not account for bidirectional apoptosis (activation-induced cell death [AICD]). Most attempts to derive cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays have been unsuccessful because individual effectors and targets could not be identified (i.e., ""separated"") using gating techniques., METHODS: In the present study, teleost nonspecific cytotoxic (NCC) and mammalian target cells were each sufficiently different in size to identify them by flow cytometry (FCM). Using appropriate gating and discriminator techniques, these two cell populations were differentiated based on scatter properties and propidium iodide (PI) binding. Total capacity for PI binding was obtained by permeabilization of the targets with ice-cold acetone. Spontaneous PI binding was relatively low. This technique detected cytotoxicity at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 1:1 and after only 30 min cocultivation., RESULTS: Tilapia NCC from peripheral blood kill human transformed target cells by necrosis and apoptosis as identified by PI binding. Maximum killing of HL-60 targets (approximately 100%) occurred by 180 min cocultivation. For the same time, the killing of IM-9 did not exceed 60%. Almost 90% of IM-9 targets are lysed following 14 h of cocultivation. The maximum killing of both HL-60 and IM-9 targets was observed at a 25:1 E:T ratio after 14 h. Comparisons of the chromium(>51) release assay with flow detection of cytotoxicity revealed that FCM detected 55% lysis of the target cells compared with 2% cytotoxicity by chromium release, after a cocultivation time of 240 min., DISCUSSION: FCM detection of (teleost) NCC lysis of target cells using PI uptake is more sensitive than standard chromium release assays. This level of sensitivity was observed because NCC and targets were sufficiently different in size such that they could be resolved by scatter plots. Using FCM, cytotoxicity was detected earlier and at lower E:T ratios than previously reported for chromium release assays. Although tilapia were reported previously to be not capable of lysing IM-9 targets by chromium release detection, the more sensitive method of FCM detected cytotoxicity using PI uptake. HL-60 lysis by tilapia NCC exhibited saturable kinetics but occurred at different times post-cocultivation. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
543,"In vivo UHMWPE biodegradation of retrieved prosthesis Sixty-two ultra high molecular weight polyethylene prosthetic components (PEs) (31 tibial plateaux and 31 cups), sterilised by gamma rays or ethylene oxide (EtO), were retrieved after 1-12 years depending on different medical reasons and were studied by FTIR spectroscopy with derivatisation of oxidised species. Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process. Ester and acid formation might arise from the diffusion of components of synovial liquid or from the oxidation process, whereas hydroperoxide formation is thought to be due to the oxidation. Abrasion and delamination process is discussed considering the topological distribution of degradation products.",Excluded
3066,"Detection of renal dysfunction by point-of-care creatinine testing in patients undergoing peripheral MR angiography OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to analyze the effectiveness of prestudy questionnaires in identifying at-risk patients and estimate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk factors, and other comorbidities in patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity MR angiography (MRA) studies using gadoliniumbased contrast agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patent demographics, comorbidities, contrast type, and point-of-care (POC) serum creatinine values were recorded from the medical records of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity MRA examinations in a single year. Patients were divided into groups by CKD stage (non-CKD, stage III, stage IV, or stage V) on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate values determined from POC creatinine results. Patient awareness of a history of CKD was noted if patients admitted to any form of CKD on prestudy questionnaires. RESULTS. Of 199 patients, 72 patients (36.2%) had stage III CKD, six patients (3.0%) had stage IV CKD, and seven patients (3.5%) had stage V CKD. Comorbidities - including smoking status, transplant status, and presence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease - as well as administered contrast type and dosage showed significant differences among the CKD groups (p < 0.05). Only five stage III patients (7%) were aware of any history of renal dysfunction, whereas three stage IV patients (50%) and seven stage V patients (100%) admitted any history of renal dysfunction via questionnaires. CONCLUSION. Compared with POC creatinine testing, a prestudy questionnaire used alone is ineffective in identifying all patients with histories of CKD who are scheduled to undergo gadolinium-based peripheral MRA studies. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
851,"The effect of chronic low-level exposure on hair damages of radiation workers According to chronic exposure of radiation workers during their work experience,this study was an attempt to assess the damage caused by radiation on the hair of radiation workers. In this study the total Skin and Hair Analyzing System capable of registering polarized images was used for measuring hair parameters (hair thickness,hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil). Hair management software ,Skin Management Software and also 150X,700X lenses were used to measure the hair parameters. The study included one questionnaire which it's face validity and content validity was approved by pilot study and some professional experts. The participants were 152 hospital personnel and were divided into radiation exposed group (radiotherapy technicians,nuclear medicine technicians) and control group (nurses) and were homogenized based on age,work situation,work time,work experience and baldness (family history). Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers. The reason may be inadequate training of technologists and their high workload.Copyright © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.",Included

561,"Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for tonsillar carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background: We performed this study to analyze treatment outcomes and to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with tonsillar carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with tonsillar carcinoma treated with RT between January 1979 and September 2009. Of the 164 patients, 91 were treated with 2-dimensional RT (2D-RT), 46 were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), and 27 were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). When patients were treated with IMRT, simultaneous integrated boost was used. Thirty patients were treated with RT alone, 40 patients were treated with chemotherapy and RT (CRT), 66 patients were treated with surgery and RT and/or chemotherapy (SRT), and 28 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Bilateral neck irradiation was delivered to 141 patients, and ipsilateral neck irradiation to 23 patients. In definitive RT, median dose was 70 Gy (range, 51-71), 70 Gy (54-74), and 67.5 Gy for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. In postoperative RT, median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 54-70.2), 66 Gy (54-70), and 63 Gy (60-67.5) for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. Acute and late toxicity were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 42 months (range, 2-288). The 5-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 94%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, 5-year DFS rate was associated with the RT technique (2DRT, 77%; 3D-CRT, 82%; IMRT, 100%, p = 0.035), T stage (T1-2, 87%; T3-4, 74%, p = 0.036), and treatment modality (RT alone, 55%; CRT, 78%; SRT, 92%; CCRT, 92%, p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, advanced T stage and treatment modality were statistically significant prognostic factors in DFS rate. None of the patients who were treated with ipsilateral neck irradiation experienced relapse in contralateral neck nodes. After the completion of RT, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade >=2 xerostomia 91%, 58%, 59%, 35%, and 78%, respectively. At least 6 months of follow-up, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade <=1 xerostomia 52%, 76%, 78%, 98%, and 63%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In selected patients with well lateralized tonsillar carcinoma, ipsilateral neck irradiation can be an alternative to bilateral neck irradiation, regarding DFS rate and complications. There was no failure when patients were treated with IMRT, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the 72.0 Gy in 42 fractions/6 weeks). The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate of patients who completed >= 70% of the cetuximab planned dose administration (in terms of the relative dose intensity of cetuximab) and the full dose of radiotherapy >= 2 weeks over the planned schedule (in terms of radiotherapy duration >=8 weeks). Result(s): From Mar 2009 until Jan 2010, 27 pts were screened. Of them, 22 pts were enrolled and treated (ITT population). Patients characteristics of ITT population: median age (years), 67.0 (range, 53 to 81); male/female, 21/1 pts; oropharynx/hypopharynx/larynx, 6/8/8 pts; stage III/IV, 12/10 pts. The median duration of cetuximab treatment was 7.9 weeks (range, 7 to 9), and that of RT was 44.0 days (range, 40 to 52). All 22 pts completed the treatment, and the completion rate was 100% (95% CI: 84.6%, 100.0%). The response rate (CR+PR) post RT was 81.8% (assessed by the independent committee). All pts experienced AEs. Most common AEs with grade 3/4 were mucosal inflammation (16pts, 72.7%), dermatitis (6pts, 27.3%), infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (each in 5 pts, 22.7%). Conclusion(s): The completion rate (100%) and the response rate (81.8%) are comparable to those of the cetuximab + RT group in the multinational randomized phase III study (Bonner et al. 2006). AEs were consistent with the underlying disease, administration of RT or cetuximab. The study results demonstrate that cetuximab + RT is well-tolerated, a feasible and efficacious treatment in Japanese pts. superiority of IMRT. Our results were not able to confirm which treatment regimen is most optimal. So, further study is needed to confirm the optimal therapeutic regimen.",Excluded
207,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

1788,"Assessment of ocular exposure to ultraviolet-B for population studies. Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project Team We have developed an empirical model with which to estimate the ocular exposure in the UVB wavelength band. This model incorporates aspects of personal behavior, geographic location, season and wavelength that have been developed from population-based data. This model, in conjunction with job history interviews, allows the estimate of cumulative exposures from age 30 in our population-based study. We present data on average annual exposure by age, gender, race, education and reported photophobia. The exposures in the general population are considerably lower than exposures reported in previous works based on occupational groups. There is a statistically significant difference between males and females, with females having lower exposures. African-Americans have median exposures similar to whites. Exposures decrease with education and with reported photophobia. These data provide the basis for characterizing lifetime exposure for the general population. The variability of exposure is much greater than found in occupational groups and includes numbers in the lowest exposure. The model should permit determination of a dose-response relationship with eye disease, even to the lower dose ranges.",Excluded
2238,"Patient Knowledge Regarding Radiation Exposure From Foot and Ankle Imaging Foot and ankle surgeons routinely prescribe diagnostic imaging that exposes patients to potentially harmful ionizing radiation. It is unclear how well patients understand the radiation to which they are exposed. In this study, 946 consecutive new patients were surveyed regarding medical imaging and radiation exposure prior to their first appointment. Respondents compared the amount of radiation associated with chest X-rays (CXRs) with various types of foot and ankle imaging. Results were compared with actual values of radiation exposure from the published literature. Of 946 patients surveyed, 841 (88.9%) participated. Most had private insurance (82.8%) and a bachelor's degree or higher (60.6%). Most believed that foot X-ray, ankle X-ray, ""low dose"" foot and ankle computed tomography (CT) scan (alluding to cone-beam CT), and traditional foot and ankle CT scan contain similar amounts of ionizing radiation to CXR. This contradicts the published literature that suggests that the actual exposure to patients is 0.006, 0.006, 0.127, and 0.833 CXR equivalents of radiation, respectively. Of patients who had undergone an X-ray, 55.9% thought about the issue of radiation prior to the study, whereas 46.1% of those undergoing a CT scan considered radiation prior to the exam. Similarly, 35.2% and 27.6% reported their doctor having discussed radiation with them prior to obtaining an X-ray and CT scan, respectively. Patients greatly overestimate the radiation exposure associated with plain film X-rays and cone-beam CT scans of the foot and ankle, and may benefit from increased counseling regarding the relatively low radiation exposure associated with these imaging modalities.

2646,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal carcinoma: Baseline hematologic parameters influencing outcomes Background: The link between the blood count and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is indisputable and well described. Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From 2009-2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study and analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings. Blood count levels which included RBC (red blood cells), Hb (hemoglobin), PLT (platelet count), neutrophil count, WBC (white blood cells), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) were analyzed in relation to tumor downstaging, pCR (pathologic complete response), OS (overall survival), and DFS (disease-free survival). Result(s): Hb levels were associated with a response in logistic regression analysis: pCR (p = 0.05; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07); T downstaging (p = 0.006; OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05); N downstaging (p = 0.09; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); T or N downstaging (p = 0.007; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07); T and N downstaging (p = 0.02; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); Hb and RBC were the most significant parameters influencing OS; PLT was a negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS (p = 0.008 for OS); an NLR value of 2.8 was associated with the greatest significance for OS (p = 0.03) and primary tumor downstaging (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Knowledge of pretreatment hematological parameters appears to be an important prognostic factor in patients with rectal carcinoma.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1104,"Volumetric modulated arc therapy with flattening filter free beams for isolated abdominal/pelvic lymph nodes: Report of dosimetric and early clinical results in oligometastatic patients Background: SBRT is a safe and efficient strategy to locally control multiple metastatic sites. While research in the physics domain for Flattening Filter Free Beams (FFF) beams is increasing, there are few clinical data of FFF beams in clinical practice. Here we reported dosimentric and early clinical data of SBRT and FFF delivery in isolated lymph node oligometastatic patients. Method(s): Between October 2010 and March 2012, 34 patients were treated with SBRT for oligometastatic lymph node metastasis on a Varian TrueBeamTM treatment machine using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (RapidArc). We retrospectively evaluated a total of 25 patients for isolated lymph node metastases in abdomen and/or pelvis treated with SBRT and FFF (28 treatments). Acute toxicity was recorded. Local control evaluation was scored by means of CT scan and/or PET scan. Result(s): All dosimetric results are in line with what published for the same type of stereotactic abdominal lymph node metastases treatments and fractionation, using RapidArc. All 25 FFF SBRT patients completed the treatment. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was minimal: one patient showed Grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity. Three other patients presented Grade 2 toxicity. No Grade 3 or higher was recorded. All toxicities were recovered within one week. The preliminary clinical results at the median follow up of 195 days are: complete response in 12 cases, partial response in 11, stable disease in 5, with an overall response rate of 82%; no local progression was recorded. Conclusion(s): Data of dosimetrical findings and acute toxicity are excellent for patients treated with SBRT with VMAT using FFF beams. Preliminary clinical results showed a high rate of local control in irradiated lesion.

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were, respectively, 57% and 29% (overall) (median, 28.6 months), 81% and 56% (cancer-specific), and 68% and 50% (local disease-free). Acute toxicity included pneumothorax (1.5%) and mucosal inflammation (10%). Late complications were hemoptysis (6.6% with 5% of fatalities), bronchitis (19.5%), and necrosis (3.5%). In multivariate analysis, a distal tumor location and the use of two catheters were associated with improved local disease-free survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively) and a distal tumor location with improved overall survival (p = 0.0001). Conclusion(s): This large retrospective study confirms that HDR brachytherapy is an efficient and safe treatment in patients with inoperable endobronchial carcinoma.

PEM synergizes with ionizing radiation and CIS in preclinical models. PEM+CIS doublets showed efficacy and favourable toxicity profiles in Phase I/II studies of NS-NSCLC. This singlearm multicenter Phase II study investigated efficacy and safety of PEM+CIS induction followed by full-dose PEM+CIS plus concurrent RT in pts with LA NS-NSCLC. Material(s) and Method(s): Pts with unresectable Stage IIIA/IIIB NS-NSCLC, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 and forced expiratory volume (FEV) >50% of predicted normal FEV received two 21-day cycles of PEM 500 mg/m2 + CIS 75 mg/m2 on Day 1. Pts who had not progressed, had no residual neurological toxicity >Grade(G) 2, PS 0-1 and lung V20 <35% then received 2 cycles of the same full-dose PEM+CIS regimen plus concurrent thoracic RT of 2 Gy/fraction, 5d/wk for 7wks (66 Gy total). All pts received vitamin supplementation/dexamethasone prophylaxis as per PEM-label. Primary endpoint was the 1 yr progression-free survival (PFS) rate. A minimum of 53 events was required to provide 90% power to demonstrate an improvement of the 1 yr PFS rate from 45% (historical data) to 60% at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%, resulting in a sample size of 88 pts assuming 10% dropouts. Secondary data presented include tumor response and toxicity. Result(s): 90 pts were enrolled in 4 countries: median age 61 yrs, male/ female 57%/43%, ECOG PS 0/1 66%/34%, mean (SD) FEV 2.3 (0.62)L, adenocarcinoma 90%, Stage IIIA/IIIB 36%/62% (2 pts had Stage IV and discontinued before starting RT). 75 pts (83.3%) completed induction CT and started concurrent CT+RT. 63 of the 75 pts (84.0%) received all 4 CT cycles and full RT of 66 Gy. Median PEM+CIS dose intensities were >97% during concurrent CT+RT, median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 18-66 Gy). The 1 yr PFS rate was 51.3% (95% CI 42.0-60.5). After a median follow-up of 24 months, median PFS was 10.6 months (95% CI 8.6-17.3). Response data are shown as table. One pt died from study-drug related toxicity (enteritis) during Cycle 4. Four pts discontinued due to non-fatal drug- or radiation related adverse events, 1 on induction CT (renal failure), 3 on concurrent CT+RT (hypoacusis, 2x radiation esophagitis). During induction CT, 18.9% of pts reported G3/4 CTCAEs, only neutropenia (2.2%) and syncope (2.2%) were reported by >1 pt.

2418,"Opaque intraocular lens for intractable diplopia: experience and patients' expectations and satisfaction AIM: To report the authors' experience with the use of opaque intraocular lenses (IOL) in diplopia unresponsive to traditional management strategies, and to assess patients' satisfaction and the visual function of patients following insertion of opaque IOL using the Visual Function Index (VF-14)., SETTINGS: Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK., METHOD: Data were obtained on all patients who underwent insertion of an opaque IOL at our institution between 2002 and 2006. Patients were interviewed by telephone. Any visual function impairment was assessed using the VF-14 questionnaire. Patients were also asked to score subjectively their overall satisfaction with the visual outcome after opaque IOL insertion., RESULTS: The authors studied 12 patients (n = 12) who had insertion of opaque IOL. All patients had constant and persistent diplopia unresponsive to other treatments acceptable to the patient. The median duration of diplopia was 5.5 years (interquartile range was 2.4-17.3 years). The postoperative VF-14 ranged from 75 to 100, and the mean VF-14 was 91 (95% CI 83-99). Three patients reported a maximum score of 100. Patient satisfaction ranged from 2 to 4, and the average was 3.4 out of 4., CONCLUSIONS: Opaque IOL insertion is a valuable option in the management of intractable diplopia. The VF-14 revealed very little or no impairment in visual function following the procedure. All patients reported improvement in their visual function and were pleased with the final outcome.",Excluded
2287,"Protection of radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic system, small intestine and salivary glands in rats by JNJ7777120 compound, a histamine H4 ligand Based on previous data on the histamine radioprotective effect on highly radiosensitive tissues, in the present work we aimed at investigating the radioprotective potential of the H4R ligand, JNJ7777120, on ionizing radiation-induced injury and genotoxic damage in small intestine, salivary glands and hematopoietic tissue. For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%. The survival rates within 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.7%, 51.6% and 41.9% respectively, which were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). However, the clinical group had significantly more 1st and 2nd degree myelosuppression and hand-foot syndrome. The symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment.

A preliminary report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02 BACKGROUND: The third and final randomization of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 83-02 was performed to identify the maximal tolerated dose and potential efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in 1.6 Gy twice-daily fractions for adult malignant glioma., METHODS: From December 1987 to July 1989, 304 patients with malignant glioma were stratified by age, performance status, and histologic findings and randomized to receive total AHRT doses of 48.0 or 54.4 Gy, with 80 mg/m2 of bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) for 3 days every 8 weeks. Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded

Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values., RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers. LD-CTA group also used lower contrast (49 cc versus 97 cc in ND-CTA) and had lower radiation exposure (DLP/CTDI for both groups 268.3/80.7 vs 519.5/36.08, both < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Next-generation reconstruction algorithm and low-kV scanning significantly improved image quality on cerebral CTA images despite lower contrast dose and, in addition, have lower radiation exposure.",Excluded
2313,"[Topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. Protection against increased expression of interstital collagenase and reduced collagen-I expression after single exposure to UVA irradiation] Photoaged skin is characterized by a decrease of dermal collagen fibers, resulting from an increased breakdown and a diminished de novo synthesis. The increased breakdown results from an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The main building blocks involved in de novo synthesis of collagen fibers are collagen 1A1 and 1A2, the expression of which is reduced in photoaged skin. We studied the effect of topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides on UV-induced up-regulation of the expression of MMP-1 and on UV-induced down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2. The study was conducted with 10 subjects with healthy skin who were comparatively treated for 10 days with (i) a basic preparation containing jojoba oil, (ii) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, (iii) the basic preparation supplemented with phytosterols and ceramides, and (iv) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. All four preparations inhibited the UV induced up-regulation of MMP-1. Neither the basic product nor that supplemented with vitamins inhibited down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2, but addition of phytosterols and ceramides caused a decreased down-regulation of the expression of these genes. Our results indicate that phytosterols and ceramides are effective in blocking the reduced collagen synthesis after UV irradiation and even stimulating synthesis. They may be useful additions to anti-aging products.",Excluded

Factors included age, interval diagnosis of SCLC to radiotherapy (RT) of MSCC, visceral metastases, further bone metastases, gender, time developing motor deficits, pre-RT ambulatory status, number of affected vertebrae, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)., RESULTS: Improvement of motor deficits showed significant associations with ECOG PS 1-2 (P = .018); time developing motor deficits achieved borderline significance (P = .059). Post-RT ambulatory status was significantly associated with slower development of motor dysfunction (P = .003), ambulatory status (P < .001), and ECOG PS 1-2 (P < .001). No factor was significantly associated with overall response and local control. On multivariate analysis, OS was significantly associated with interval from SCLC diagnosis to RT of MSCC (P = .004), visceral metastases (P < .001), ambulatory status (P = .002), and ECOG PS (P = .002). For the survival score, 6-month OS rates related to each of these factors were divided by 10. Patient scores were obtained by adding these factors' scores. Three groups were defined (5, 7-13, and 15-17 points) with 6-month OS rates of 0, 18%, and 77%, respectively (P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Predictors of various outcomes were identified and a survival score was created that can support physicians aiming to create personalized treatments to patients with MSCC from SCLC.

METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULT(S): Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p<0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p<0.00001).

Method(s): Sixteen patients with renal staghorn stones of more than 35 mm in maximum length on plain X-rays were treated by shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy with the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP. Double-J ureteral stent was inserted to all prior to the first SWL treatment. Shock wave counts varied from 2,500 to 3,600 with a shock release frequency of 70-80 pulses per minute. The number of sessions varied from 2 to 6. The interval between the SWL sessions was around 1 month. Fragmentation rate of 20-25% of the stone load per session was considered a valid criterion for progressing to further SWL sessions. Result(s): Nine patients became stone free at the end of SWL sessions and two patients had renal stone fragments smaller than 4 mm, which were eliminated 6 months later. Two patients developed streinstrasse that was managed with ureteroscopy. Auxiliary SWL was also performed on three patients with residual ureteral calculi. The mean follow up period was 12 months. The remaining five patients underwent open surgery for incomplete stone fragmentation. No major complications developed during the follow up period. The predominant composition of stones available for analysis was struvite.

2538,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included

Method We analysed 170 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, recorded the evolution of visual acuity and complication rates, and compared their survival with 620 patients treated with eye enucleation. Different peripheral doses (using the 50% therapeutic isodose) were employed: 50-70 Gy for 24 patients, 45 Gy for 71 patients, 35 Gy for 62 patients. Findings There was no significant difference in survival between the 35-Gy, 45-Gy and 50- to 70-Gy groups when compared between themselves (p00.168) and with the enucleation group (p00.454). The 5-year survival rates were: 64% for 35 Gy, 62.71% for 45 Gy, 63.6% for 50-70 Gy and 65.2% for enucleated patients. Clinical variables influencing survival for radiosurgery patients were tumour volume (p00.014) and location (median 66.4 vs 37.36 months for juxtapapillary vs peripheral tumours, respectively; p00.001), while age and gender did not prove significant. Regarding complications, using 35 Gy led to more than a 50% decrease, when compared with the 45-Gy dose, in the incidence of cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Retinopathy, optic neuropathy and vitreous haemorrhage were not significantly influenced. Blindness decreased dramatically from 83.7% for 45 Gy to 31.4% for 35 Gy (p00.006), as well as postradiosurgery enucleation: 23.9% for 45 Gy vs 6.45% for 35 Gy (p00.018).

941,"Age at exposure to ionising radiation and cancer mortality among Hanford workers: Follow up through 1994 Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.",Included

Each patient underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford scale), and Schirmer I test. Using the tear film analysis program of the Optical Quality Analysis System, we recorded the objective scatter index (OSI) every 0.5 seconds within a 20-second period with the subjects asked to blink freely. Several parameters were established to evaluate the dynamic alterations of optical quality and the effects of blinks: OSI standard deviation (SD), DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, blinking change (BC), blinking frequency (BF), and tolerant limitation (TL)., RESULTS: Patients with DED had significant alterations of optical quality compared to control subjects. The DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, BC, and BF were significantly higher and TL was significantly lower in DED patients than controls. Furthermore, the DELTAOSI and DELTAOSI/time were also significantly higher in patients with severe DED than patients with mild disease. In univariate analysis, both TBUT and corneal staining were correlated with DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, and BC. In multivariate analysis, DELTAOSI/time was correlated to the corneal staining score., CONCLUSIONS: The double-pass system allowed the monitoring of the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with DED. Optical quality should be evaluated in patients with DED because these alterations cannot be determined from the classical DED clinical tests.",Excluded

Method(s): Inoperable patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer, treated with SBRT, who received 54 or 60 Gy in 3 fractions, and had a minimum of 6 months follow up were reviewed. Archived treatment plans were retrieved, ribs delineated individually and treatment plans re-computed using heterogeneity correction. Clinical and dosimetric factors were evaluated for their association with rib fracture using logistic regression analysis; a dose-event curve and nomogram were created. Result(s): 46 consecutive patients treated between Oct 2004 and Dec 2008 with median follow-up 25 months (m) (range 6 - 51 m) were eligible. 41 fractured ribs were detected in 17 patients; median time to fracture was 21 m (range 7 - 40 m). The mean maximum point dose in non-fractured ribs (n = 1054) was 10.5 Gy +/- 10.2 Gy, this was higher in fractured ribs (n = 41) 48.5 Gy +/- 24.3 Gy (p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, age, dose to 0.5 cc of the ribs (D0.5), and the volume of the rib receiving at least 25 Gy (V25), were significantly associated with RIBI. As D0.5 and V25 were cross-correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.57, p < 0.001), we selected D0.5 as a representative dose parameter. On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio: 1.121, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.21, p = 0.003), female gender (odds ratio: 4.43, 95% CI: 1.68 - 11.68, p = 0.003), and rib D0.5 (odds ratio: 1.0009, 95% CI: 1.0007 - 1.001, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with rib fracture.Using D0.5, a dose-event curve was constructed estimating risk of fracture from dose at the median follow up of 25 months after treatment. In our cohort, a 50% risk of rib fracture was associated with a D0.5 of 60 Gy. Conclusion(s): Dosimetric and clinical factors contribute to risk of RIBI and both should be included when modeling risk of toxicity.

2994,"Mitigation of hematologic radiation toxicity in mice through pharmacological quiescence induced by CDK4/6 inhibition Total body irradiation (TBI) can induce lethal myelosuppression, due to the sensitivity of proliferating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to ionizing radiation (IR). No effective therapy exists to mitigate the hematologic toxicities of TBI. Here, using selective and structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6, we have demonstrated that selective cellular quiescence increases radioresistance of human cell lines in vitro and mice in vivo. Cell lines dependent on CDK4/6 were resistant to IR and other DNA-damaging agents when treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. In contrast, CDK4/6 inhibitors did not protect cell lines that proliferated independently of CDK4/6 activity. Treatment of wild-type mice with CDK4/6 inhibitors induced reversible pharmacological quiescence (PQ) of early HSPCs but not most other cycling cells in the bone marrow or other tissues. Selective PQ of HSPCs decreased the hematopoietic toxicity of TBI, even when the CDK4/6 inhibitor was administered several hours after TBI. Moreover, PQ at the time of administration of therapeutic IR to mice harboring autochthonous cancers reduced treatment toxicity without compromising the therapeutic tumor response. These results demonstrate an effective method to mitigate the hematopoietic toxicity of IR in mammals, which may be potentially useful after radiological disaster or as an adjuvant to anticancer therapy.",Excluded

Overall mean differences between DDM and CBCT measurements of mesiodistal angulation, 1.9degree+/-1.5degree, and buccolingual inclination, 2.2+/-2.2degree, were not significant for all teeth. ICC between DDM and CBCT measurements ranged from good (0.85 molars) to excellent (0.94 canines; 0.96 incisors). The percentages of measurements outside the range of +/-5 were 17.4% for molars, 13.8% for canines, and 4.5% for incisors. CONCLUSION(S): DDM assessment of changes in tooth long axes has good reproducibility and yields comparable measurements to those obtained from CBCT within a 5degree range. These findings lay the groundwork for machine learning approaches that synthesize crown and root canal information towards planning tooth movement without the need for ionizing radiation scans.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

2310,"Influence of nerve radiation dose in the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction after trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a comparative study to analyze dosimetry and results to understand the significant difference in the rate of trigeminal dysfunction after gamma knife radiosurgery for trigeminal neuralgia between two centers using the same target., METHODS: The data of 358 patients (109 patients from Brussels and 259 patients from Marseilles) were analyzed. Three different dosimetric strategies were found: treatment with less than 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 1; patients from Marseilles only), treatment with 90 Gy and no selective beam channel blocking (Group 2; patients from Brussels and Marseilles), or treatment with 90 Gy and use of selective beam channel blocking (Group 3; patients from Brussels only)., RESULTS: The prescription dose and the use of selective beam channel blocking have been significantly associated with a higher energy received by the retrogasserian trigeminal nerve root. The different radiation dose delivered to the nerve root in these three groups of patients was significantly associated with the incidence of mild (15, 21, and 49% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) and bothersome (1.4, 2.4, and 10% for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively) trigeminal dysfunction. The good and excellent rates of pain relief were 81 and 66%, respectively, for Group 1, 85 and 77%, respectively, for Group 2, and 90 and 84%, respectively, for Group 3, and were also related to the amount of energy received by nerve root volume., CONCLUSION: Using a similar target, the incidence of trigeminal dysfunction and the pain relief rate can vary according to the radiation energy received by the retrogasserian part of the trigeminal nerve root. The prescription dose and the use of beam channel blocking modify the integrated dose delivered to the nerve and may contribute to the different rates of trigeminal numbness and pain outcome. The radiobiological effect of gamma knife radiosurgery may be related to the energy delivered to nerve root volume, rather than to the maximal dose delivered.",Excluded
3270,"A new model of biodosimetry to integrate low and high doses Biological dosimetry, that is the estimation of the dose of an exposure to ionizing radiation by a biological parameter, is a very important tool in cases of radiation accidents. The score of dicentric chromosomes, considered to be the most accurate method for biological dosimetry, for low LET radiation and up to 5 Gy, fits very well to a linear-quadratic model of dose-effect curve assuming the Poisson distribution. The accuracy of this estimation raises difficulties for doses over 5 Gy, the highest dose of the majority of dose-effect curves used in biological dosimetry. At doses over 5 Gy most cells show difficulties in reaching mitosis and cannot be used to score dicentric chromosomes. In the present study with the treatment of lymphocyte cultures with caffeine and the standardization of the culture time, metaphases for doses up to 25 Gy have been analyzed. Here we present a new model for biological dosimetry, which includes a Gompertz-type function as the dose response, and also takes into account the underdispersion of aberration-among-cell distribution. The new model allows the estimation of doses of exposures to ionizing radiation of up to 25 Gy. Moreover, the model is more effective in estimating whole and partial body exposures than the classical method based on linear and linear-quadratic functions, suggesting their effectiveness and great potential to be used after high dose exposures of radiation.",Excluded
2442,"Delayed non-myeloablative irradiation after lung transplantation to induce allograft acceptance in a large animal model Purpose: Previously, we induced long term tolerance in animals that underwent perioperative irradiation and a donor-specific alloantigen infusion in our miniature swine lung transplantation model. Here, we delayed induction to improve its clinical applicability. Method(s): Left sided single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched male donors was performed in 11 female outbred minipigs. Group 1 (n= 5) received non-myeloablative irradiation (7 Gy thymus and 1,5 Gy whole body, IRR) 12 hours before transplantation and perioperative donor-specific splenocyte infusion (SpTx). Group 2 (n= 3) also received a perioperative SpTx, but underwent delayed irradiation 3 days after transplantation. Group 3 (n= 3) was also exposed to delayed IRR but did not receive a donor-specific SpTx. Immunosuppression was maintained for 28 days with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Peripheral blood chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): In group 1, three animals never rejected their grafts until elective sacrifice at postoperative days (POD) 800+, the other two showed rejection on POD 239 and 360. In group 2, median allograft survival was 92 days. Out of the third group, one animal showed rejection on POD 226, the other two are currently alive at POD 216 and 393. In all groups, chimerism was detectable 1 hour after reperfusion of the lung, and peaked 1 hour after SpTx in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 showed early leukocyte chimerism levels of up to 30%. Analysis of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells revealed a rising tendency in group 1, whereas groups 2 and 3 had decreasing levels of this T cell subpopulation after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Conclusion(s): Preoperative irradiation and perioperative SpTx had the potential to upregulate the frequency of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells. SpTx without preceding IRR seemed to rather upregulate the effector arm, than inducing Treg proliferation. Delayed IRR only may lead to prolonged allograft survival in all three animals. This unresponsiveness might be due to induced anergy.",Excluded

393,"[Phosphorylation of histone H2AX in human lymphocytes as a possible marker of effective cellular response to ionizing radiation] DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included

172,"Postoperative irradiation for pterygium: retrospective analysis of 1,253 patients from the Osaka University Hospital BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation of ocular pterygium is considered a valuable treatment supplementation after surgical therapy. Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence. The data obtained in this study indicate that a certain interval after surgery might improve therapy outcome.",Included
1608,"Usefulness of doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms secondary to minimally invasive interventional and surgical procedures: imaging findings and diagnostic performance study The pseudoaneurysm (PA) is a perfused sac directly connecting with the arterial lumen by an interruption of the vessel wall continuity, more commonly secondary to trauma or iatrogenic causes. Aim of our study was to determine the accuracy and usefulness of Doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic PAs secondary to minimally invasive procedures. From a three year prospective research, 20 Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) studies in as many patients presenting with periarterial pulsating mass clinically suspected for PA secondary to minimally invasive procedures were selected. The PA final diagnosis was confirmed by angiography in 12 patients (60% cases), by computed tomography angiography in 5 patients (25%), by surgery in 2 patients (10%), and by magnetic resonance angiography in 1 patient (5%). The vessels involved by PA formation were: common femoral artery in 8 cases (40%); superficial femoral artery in 4 cases (20%); brachial artery in 3 cases (15%); popliteal artery in 2 cases (10%); superficial temporal artery (STA) in 2 cases (10%); dorsal medial digital artery of the foot in 1 case (5%). Our study confirmed the usefulness of doppler techniques in the diagnosis of peripheral iatrogenic PAs. Specifically, a sensitivity of 90-95%, a specificity of 100% and predictive values of 100% (VPP) and 83-90% (VPN) were reported. The radiologist must always suspect a PA in the differential diagnosis of lesions contiguous to an artery vessel. This is to prevent potential complications such as e.g. massive haemorrhage. In this order, DUS allows a careful selection of patients who require to undergo in-depth imaging methods or surgical therapy, thus contributing to a significant reduction of contrast medium and exposure to ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2020, Societa Italiana di Ultrasonologia in Medicina e Biologia (SIUMB).",Excluded
3078,"Comparison of Whole Heart Computed Tomography Scanners for Image Quality Lower Radiation Dosing in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: The CONVERGE Registry RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Novel technology in coronary computed tomographic angiography allows assessment of coronary artery disease with high image quality (IQ). There are currently two wide detector ""whole heart"" coverage scanners available, which avoid misregistration artifacts. However, there are no data directly comparing IQ between the two scanners. The aim of the current study is to investigate if IQ is different between the most scanners of GE and Toshiba broad detector scanners., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter international cohort study comparing 236 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography using whole-heart scanners; 126 patients on scanner S1 ( Aquilion ONE Vision, Toshiba), and 110 patients on scanner S2 (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). Hounsfield units were measured using regions of interest in the descending aorta at 6 points (cranial slice, level of the visualized first, second, third, and fourth spines, and the caudal slice). We also compared the coverage length (z-axis) of the full width field of view between a single rotation of the two scanners., RESULTS: Evaluating mean CT attenuation values Hounsfield units through the scan range, are progressively reduced across the descending aorta in the S1 group, resulting in the larger difference of contrast brightness between the cranial and caudal slices compared to the S2 group (absolute difference: S2 13.0 +/- 4.4 vs S1 141.9 +/- 16.4, p < 0.0001; Percent difference: 19.3 +/- 2.1 vs -3.4 +/- 1.2, <0.0001). The standard deviation (SD) is similar at the cranial slice between the two scanners, however, the S1 group demonstrated higher SD-differential from cranial to caudal than S2 group. Median radiation exposure was significantly lower for the S2 scanner 1.50 +/- 0.75 mSv vs the S1 system 1.9 mSv (IQR 1.7-2.7 mSv) (p=0.01). Z-axis coverage was larger for the S2 scanner 152.5 mm (244 slices x 0.625 mm/slice) than 133 mm for S1 (266 slices x 0.5 mm/slice)., CONCLUSION: Although both ""volume"" scanners cover the whole heart z-axis with one beat, scans using the S1 scanner have a larger variability in attenuation values throughout the scan range, resulting in 20% increase in nonuniformity from cranial to caudal slice. Additionally, SD variation across the field of view, a metric of noise, is larger when using the S1 scanner vs the S2 scanner. These results indicate that the GE Revolution CT has more uniform contrast enhancement and more coverage, lower radiation and lower image noise compared to the Toshiba Aquilion ONE Vision system.

3138,"Dynamic visual acuity during walking after long-duration spacefl ight Introduction: Astronauts experience alterations in gaze control as a result of adaptive changes in eye-head coordination produced by microgravity exposure. This may lead to potential changes in postfl ight visual acuity during head and body motion. Method(s): We gathered dynamic visual acuity (DVA) data from 14 astronauts and cosmonauts after longduration (~6 mo) stays in space. Walking was used to induce self-motion and visual acuity was determined by sequentially presenting Landolt ring optotypes on a computer display placed 4 m in front of subjects. Acuity assessments were made while seated (static condition) and walking (dynamic condition) at 6.4 km . h-1 on a motorized treadmill. In each condition, a psychophysical threshold detection algorithm minimized the required number of optotype presentations by maximizing the amount displayed around the subject's acuity threshold. The difference between static and dynamic acuity measures provided a metric of change in the subjects' ability to maintain gaze fi xation on the visual target while walking. Result(s): A decrement in postfl ight visual acuity during walking was found. A mean dynamic acuity decrement of approximately 0.75 eye-chart lines was observed 1 d after returning from space. The population mean showed a consistent improvement in DVA performance during the fi rst postfl ight week. Discussion(s): The recovery curves for individual subjects did not necessarily follow a pattern of continuous improvement with each passing day. When adjusted for previous long-duration fl ight experience, the population mean showed an unexpected DVA reduction in the re-adaptation curve that is similar to recovery patterns observed in prism adaptation studies.",Excluded

1041,"Assessment of pulmonary 18F-FDG-PET uptake and cytokine profiles in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and erlotinib Purpose To investigate effects of radiotherapy (RT) and erlotinib on pulmonary glucose uptake using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during and after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to identify associations between serum cytokine levels and lung glucose uptake. Material and methods Twenty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC, receiving RT alone or concomitant RT and erlotinib therapy, were examined by 18F-FDG PET before, during, and after treatment. A total of 57 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed. Pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake and radiotherapy dose mapping were used to acquire dose-response curves for each patient, where subsequent linear regression gave a glucose uptake level in the un-irradiated parts of the lungs (SUV0) and a response slope (DELTASUV). Serum cytokine levels at corresponding time points were assessed using a multiplex bioassay. Correlations between the most robust cytokines and lung 18F-FDG dose response parameters were further investigated. Results From the dose response analysis, SUV0 at post-therapy was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than at mid- and pre-therapy (45% and 58%, respectively) for the group receiving RT + erlotinib. Also, SUV0 at post-therapy was higher for patients receiving RT + erlotinib compared to RT alone (42%; P < 0.001). No differences in DELTASUV were seen with treatments or time. SUV0 was positively associated (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) with serum levels of the chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) for patients receiving RT + erlotinib. Conclusions Concomitant RT and erlotinib causes an elevation in pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake post treatment compared to RT alone. Pulmonary glucose uptake is associated with an upregulation of a chemokine (CCL21) involved in inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded

162,"Nonlinear interactions of high-frequency oscillations in the human somatosensory system OBJECTIVE: The source of somatosensory evoked high-frequency activity at about 600 Hz is still not completely clear. Hence, we aimed to study the influence of double stimulation on the human somatosensory system by analyzing both the low-frequency activity and the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at about 600 Hz., METHODS: We used median nerve stimulation at seven interstimuli intervals (ISIs) with a high time resolution between 2.4 and 4.8 ms to investigate the N15, N20 and superimposed HFOs. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram and the magnetoencephalogram of 12 healthy participants were recorded. Subsequently, the source analysis of precortical and cortical dipoles was performed., RESULTS: The difference computations of precortical dipole activation curves showed in both the low- and high-frequency range a correlation between the ISI and the latency of the second stimulus response. The cortical low-frequency response showed a similar behavior. Contrarily, in the second response of cortical HFOs this latency shift could not be confirmed. We found amplitude fluctuations that were dependent on the ISI in the low-frequency activity and the HFOs. These nonlinear interactions occurred at ISIs, which differ by one full HFO period (1.6 ms)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency activity and HFOs originate from different generators. Precortical and cortical HFOs are independently generated. The amplitude fluctuations dependent on ISI indicate nonlinear interference between successive stimuli., SIGNIFICANCE: Information processing in human somatosensory system includes nonlinearity.",Excluded
2034,"Tolerance and dose-volume relationship of intrathoracic stomach irradiation after esophagectomy for patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Purpose: To identify the tolerance of radiation with a high prescribed dose and predictors for the development of intrathoracic stomach toxicity in patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after esophagectomy followed by gastric conduit reconstruction. Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2013, 105 patients after esophagectomy were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The intrathoracic stomach was outlined with the calculation of a dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the initial intended treatment of 6020 cGy or 6300 cGy. The volume of the intrathoracic stomach receiving each dose was recorded at 10-Gy intervals between 10 and 40 Gy and at 5-Gy intervals between 40 and 60 Gy. The grade of toxicities was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Result(s): The mean and maximum doses of the intrathoracic stomach were 2449 +/- 986 cGy and 6519 +/- 406 cGy, respectively. Sixteen (15.2%) and three (2.9%) experienced Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 and Grade 3 acute gastric toxicity. There were no Grade 4 toxicities. Fourteen patients (13.3%) exhibited late gastric complications possibly related to radiation. The volume percent of the intrathoracic stomach receiving at least 50 Gy (V50) was strongly associated with the degree of toxicity (p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis of patient and treatmentrelated factors revealed no other significant predictors of severe toxicities.

Method(s): All patients treated for a primary lung cancer with VMAT chemotherapy (ChT) in our center from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively included. Usual clinical, treatment and dosimetric features were collected. Univariate analysis was performed using the receiver operative characteristics approach while multivariate analysis (MVA) relied on logistic regression, calculated with Medcalc 14.8.1. Result(s): In total, 167 patients were included, with a median age of 66 years (39-88 years). Median radiation dose was 66 Gy (30-66 Gy); 82% patients received concomitant (32.3%), induction (25.7%) or induction followed by concomitant ChT (24%). After a median follow-up of 14.0 months, the G >=2 APT, AET, LPT and LET rates were 22.2%, 30.0%, 16.8% and 5.4%, respectively with low grade >=3 toxicity rates (respectively, 3%, 6.6%, 3% and 0%). On MVA, APT was significantly associated with V30 to the homolateral lung, AET with age, LPT with MEVS while no feature remained significantly correlated with LET. Conclusion(s): Low rates of pulmonary and esophageal toxicity were observed in our cohort. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.Copyright © 2021 Translational Lung Cancer Research.",Excluded
3375,"Detection of urolithiasis: comparison of 100% tube exposure images reconstructed with filtered back projection and 50% tube exposure images reconstructed with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction PURPOSE: To compare images acquired with 50% tube exposure with a dual-source computed tomographic (CT) scanner and reconstructed with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) with 100% exposure images reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) for reader ability to detect stones, reader confidence, and findings outside the urinary tract., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved study, imaging examinations in 99 patients with urolithiasis were assessed. Data from both tubes were reconstructed with FBP; data from the primary tube only were reconstructed with SAFIRE. Seven readers evaluated randomized studies for calculi in nine regions. Reader confidence was scored by using a five-point scale. Ancillary findings were noted. Nonparametric methods for clustered data were used to estimate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves with 95% confidence intervals to test for noninferiority of 50% exposure with SAFIRE., RESULTS: Calculi were found in 113 locations (pyelocalyceal ureter, 86; proximal ureter, seven; midureter, four; distal ureter, 15; bladder, one) and not found in 752 locations. Mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for FBP was 0.879 (range, 0.607-0.967) and for SAFIRE, 0.883 (range, 0.646-0.971; 95% confidence interval: -0.025, 0.031). The SAFIRE images were not significantly inferior to FBP images (P = .001). Reader confidence levels for images with stones were similar with FBP and SAFIRE (P = .963). For the 52 patients who had extraurinary findings, readers reported them correctly in 74.4% (271 of 364) and 72.0% (262 of 364) of cases (P = .215) for FBP and SAFIRE, respectively. For the nine patients with potentially important findings per the reference standard, the detection rates were 44% (28 of 63) and 33% (21 of 63, P = .024), respectively. For the 43 patients with unimportant or likely unimportant findings, the false detection rates were 15% (44 of 301) and 14% (43 of 301, P = .756), respectively., CONCLUSION: The 50% tube exposure CT images reconstructed with SAFIRE were not inferior to 100% exposure images reconstructed with FBP for diagnosis of urolithiasis, without decreases in reader confidence.",Excluded
287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included
1625,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

2805,"New effective dose estimates for Rubidium-82 based on dynamic PET/CT imaging in humans Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded
3102,"Quantitative changes in respiratory enzyme activity in premalignant lesions and experimentally irradiated skin Chronic exposure of human skin to solar irradiation results in a variety of preneoplastic and frankly neoplastic skin lesions. We have shown that in solar keratoses (SK) and in paralesional skin there is instead of an even distribution of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity a relative decreased activity in the granular cell layer. Furthermore, there is enhancement of the usual concentration of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity in the granular zone as well as an increase in total G6PDH epidermal activity. In the experimental part of this study, six normal volunteer subjects had areas of normally non exposed skin (buttocks) irradiated with a 2 Mean erythema dose of ultra violet light (290--400 nm) on between 3 and 5 occasions per week for 2--6 week periods. The results obtained indicated that the same changes in enzyme activity localization take place in artificially irradiated normally non exposed epidermis as seen in normally exposed skin nearby actinic keratoses. It is suggested that these quantitative changes may be the basis of a model for the study of chronic ultra violet light damage to the epidermis.",Excluded

Primordial germ cells (PGCs) from embryos at specific developmental stages have been analyzed, and cells with apoptotic morphology have been isolated by cell sorting. In the female, apoptotic oogonia at Day 13 and apoptotic oocytes at Days 15 and 17 were found. In the male, apoptotic cells were seen on Day 13 through Day 17. Apoptotic germ cells were not detected at Day 12 (combined male and female PGCs). Examination of sorted cells by fluorescence microscopy and by light microscopic analysis after alkaline phosphatase staining confirmed that the cells are apoptotic germ cells.

1329,"Cancer incidence and mortality in populations living near uranium milling and mining operations in grants, New Mexico, 1950-2004 In a previous cohort study of workers engaged in uranium milling and mining activities near Grants, Cibola County, New Mexico, we found lung cancer mortality to be significantly increased among underground miners. Uranium mining took place from early in the 1950s to 1990, and the Grants Uranium Mill operated from 1958-1990. The present study evaluates cancer mortality during 1950-2004 and cancer incidence during 1982-2004 among county residents. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed, with observed numbers of cancer deaths and cases compared to expected values based on New Mexico cancer rates. The total numbers of cancer deaths and incident cancers were close to that expected (SMR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; SIR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Lung cancer mortality and incidence were significantly increased among men (SMR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; SIR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18-1.64) but not women (SMR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.10; SIR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78-1.29). Similarly, among the population of the three census tracts near the Grants Uranium Mill, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated among men (SMR 1.57; 95% CI 1.21-1.99) but not women (SMR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75-1.61). Except for an elevation in mortality for stomach cancer among women (SMR 1.30; 95% CI 1.03-1.63), which declined over the 55-year observation period, no significant increases in SMRs or SIRs for 22 other cancers were found. Although etiological inferences cannot be drawn from these ecological data, the excesses of lung cancer among men seem likely to be due to previously reported risks among underground miners from exposure to radon gas and its decay products. Smoking, socioeconomic factors or ethnicity may also have contributed to the lung cancer excesses observed in our study. The stomach cancer increase was highest before the uranium mill began operation and then decreased to normal levels. With the exception of male lung cancer, this study provides no clear or consistent evidence that the operation of uranium mills and mines adversely affected cancer incidence or mortality of county residents.",Excluded
1628,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

297,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

2412,"Pilot study trialling a new ambulatory method for the clinical assessment of regional gastrointestinal transit using multiple electromagnetic capsules BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) motor disorders often involve several regions of the GI tract. Therefore, easy and safe assessment of whole gut and regional motility is valuable for more precise diagnosis. 3D-Transit is a novel method for ambulatory evaluation of total and regional gastrointestinal transit times (GITT) based on the anatomical localization of ingestible electromagnetic capsules. The main purpose of this study was to test the performance of the 3D-Transit system., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers each ingested three electromagnetic capsules over a period of two consecutive days. Standard radio-opaque markers (ROM) were also ingested to assess the agreement between total GITT obtained with both methods., KEY RESULTS: Investigations were well-tolerated and three capsules could be tracked simultaneously with minimal data loss (Capsule 1: median: 0.2% of time (range 0-25.3%). Region specific contraction patterns were identified and used for computation of total and regional GITT in all subjects. Inter-observer agreement was 100% for total GITT (median variation 0%) but less for regional GITT. Day-to-day and diurnal variations were significant for total and regional GITT. Total GITT assessed by 3D-Transit capsules were moderately well-correlated to those assessed with standard ROM (Spearman's rho = 0.7)., CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: 3D-transit is a well-tolerated and minimal invasive ambulatory method for assessment of GI motility. By providing both total and regional transit times, the 3D-Transit system holds great promise for future clinical studies of GI function in health and disease.

144,"Endoscopic esophageal reconstruction for the treatment of a total and extensive disruption of the esophagus using a ''rendez-vous'' technique INTRODUCTION: Complete esophageal obstruction leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses as an alternative to surgery that has high morbid-mortality. AIMS & METHODS: This is a case series report about six patients referred for complete esophageal disruption classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (> 5cm), one after caustic ingestion and two due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal. Two had an associated loss of the SES; 2/ Short disruption (< 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy for a neck neoplasia. They had been fasting for 3 to 18 months. All the procedures were performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, under anesthesia and with CO2 insufflation and X-rays guidance. RESULT(S): There were 3 men and women between 25 and 71 years old. All the reconstructions have been successful in one to three endoscopic sessions, using the non hydrophilic tip of a guide wire passed through a straight catheter in 5 cases and a EUS needle in only one case. In 2 cases, a neo-SES had to be created, by transillumination (n=1) or head and neck surgery (n=1). In order to guide the reconstruction, SEMS was used in one case, NGT in one case, and both were used in one patient. The first dilation was performed with a CRE balloon (12-15mm). All the patients could eat mixed after 2 POD. There was no intraoperative or post-operative complication. Then, the patients underwent 3 to 18 dilations sessions during 1.5 to 15 months; two are still undergoing dilations and all eat normally. CONCLUSION(S): Endoscopic rendez-vous for esophageal reconstruction is safe and effective in case of esophageal disruption even with loss of SES, avoiding surgery.",Excluded

3012,"Diagnostic Accuracy of Fluoroscopy, Radiography, and Computed Tomography in Detecting Cement Leakage in Kyphoplasty Purpose Cement leakage is a typical complication of kyphoplasty for vertebral fractures. It is unclear if cement application intraoperatively can be improved by using other techniques of visualization and which kind of postoperative imaging should be recommended to detect cement extravasation accurately. Objective To compare the rates of cement leakage detected by intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative radiography, and postoperative computed tomography (CT) in a retrospective study. Patients and Methods The study included 78 patients (60 women and 18 men; 115 vertebral bodies) who were treated with two kinds of kyphoplasty. The patients underwent intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiography and CT. After surgery, the images were evaluated to compare cement leakage rates and locations in the three visualization techniques. Leakage locations were described as epidural, intradiskal, extravertebral, or intravascular. Results Compared with CT, intraoperative fluoroscopy regularly detected intradiskal leakage (75%) but had a considerably lower sensitivity for visualizing epidural (21%), extravertebral (31%), and intravascular (51%) cement leakages. A comparison of radiography and CT showed that radiography had a high sensitivity for detecting intradiskal (82%) and intravascular (70%) cement extrusions but a lower sensitivity in identifying epidural (42%) and extravertebral (50%) leaks. Therefore, the CT scan overall was best in detecting location and accuracy. Conclusion CT detected more cement leaks than any of the other investigated techniques, especially epidural, extravertebral, and intravascular cement leakages. To achieve the best accuracy, only CT provides complete information.Copyright © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.",Excluded

Conventionally, the endpoints for head and neck cancer patients focused on objective tumor response, local control and overall survival. These endpoints are assessed from the physician's point of view.and in view of increased number of longtime survivors, the need for understanding patients experience, their perceptions of treatment effects and their priorities have to be well recognized, Hence a prospective study was conducted to evaluate the quality of life in Indian patients of locally advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemo radiation. Method(s): Single arm prospective observational study of 53 patients receiving concurrent chemo-radiation were assessed for changes in quality of life using EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC -H&N35 questionnaires at baseline before treatment , 4th week during treatment,on completion of treatment,4weeks and 12 weeks after treatment.Data analysis was done using paired t test for each variable comparing each of the assessments done during treatment, on completion of treatment, 1 month post completion of treatment and 3months post completion of treatment comparing with baseline values . Result(s): Mean age of the study population was 52.48 +/- 11.6 years (Age range 28-72 years). There were 33.3% females and 66.7% males.There was a significant decrease in Global health related quality of life during treatment(P < 0.001) and on completion of treatment(p < 0.001) when compared to baseline scores but showing upward trends in scores post 1month and 3 month of treatment compared to baseline scores.

2574,"Preoperative isolated limb infusion of doxorubicin and external irradiation for limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas Background: At present, limb-sparing surgery is the most appropriate and acceptable treatment option for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used. Isolated limb perfusion of cytostatic agents is an effective alternative option but technically complex. Isolated limb infusion, essentially a low-flow isolated limb perfusion without oxygenation via a percutaneous catheter, had been developed as a simple alternative. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to achieve limb-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities that would otherwise have required an amputation or a functionally mutilating surgery by performing preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin and external beam irradiation to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery feasible. Method(s): A total of 40 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were evaluated between 2002 and 2005. Tumors were located in the lower limb in 28 patients (70%) and in the upper limb in 12 patients (30%). All of these patients were felt to be unresectable and were referred because amputation was considered the only available treatment option. They underwent preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg for the upper and lower limbs, respectively). Preoperative external beam radiotherapy started within 3-7 days after isolated limb infusion was administered. The total dose was 35 Gy in ten fractions. After 3-7 weeks, surgery was performed aiming at limb preservation. Result(s): Tumor response was seen in 85% of patients, rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. The mean values of pretreatment tumor volume and post-treatment volume were 2797 cm3 and 1781 cm3, respectively, with a significant p value of 0.0001. Histologic response was seen in 80% of patients. At a median followup of 15 months (range = 5-35), limb salvage was achieved in 82.5%. Procedure-related complications were limited and easily managed. Conclusion(s): Isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin is a simple and safe method of regional chemotherapy.

2793,"Characterization of haustral activity in the human colon Contraction patterns of the human colon are rarely discussed from the perspective of its haustra. Colonic motility was analyzed in 21 healthy subjects using 84-sensor manometry catheters with 1-cm sensor spacing. Capsule endoscopy and manometry showed evidence of narrow rhythmic circular muscle contractions. X-ray images of haustra and sensor locations allowed us to identify manometry motor activity as intrahaustral activity. Two common motor patterns were observed that we infer to be associated with individual haustra: rhythmic pressure activity confined to a single sensor, and activity confined to a section of the colon of 3-6 cm length. Intrahaustral activity was observed by 3-4 sensors. Approximately 50% of the haustra were intermittently active for -30% of the time; 2,402 periods of haustral activity were analyzed. Intrahaustral activity showed rhythmic pressure waves, propagating in mixed direction, 5-30 mmHg in amplitude at a frequency of -3 cpm (range 2-6) or -12 cpm (range 7-15), or exhibiting a checkerboard segmentation pattern. Boundaries of the haustra showed rhythmic pressure activity with or without elevated baseline pressure. Active haustra often showed no boundary activity probably allowing transit to neighboring haustra. Haustral boundaries were seen at the same sensor for the 6- to 8-h study duration, indicating that they did not propagate, thereby likely contributing to continence. The present study elucidates the motility characteristics of haustral boundaries and the nature of intrahaustral motor patterns and paves the way for investigating their possible role in pathophysiology of defecation disorders.Copyright © 2021 the American Physiological Society",Excluded
2196,"A randomized trial comparing dual axis rotational versus conventional coronary angiography in a population with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease OBJECTIVES: To compare the safety, radiation dose, and contrast volume between dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) and conventional coronary angiography (CCA)., BACKGROUND: CCA is performed in multiple, predefined stationary views, at different angulations around the patient, for both the left and right coronary arteries. DARCA (AlluraXperSwing TM, Philips, the Netherlands) involves a pre-set rotation of the C-arm around the patient and allows for the visualization of each coronary artery in different views, using a single automatic pump contrast injection., METHODS: From November 2012 to February 2013, 201 patients were randomly assigned to either CCA (n = 100) or DARCA (n = 101). Exclusion criteria included acute coronary syndrome (ACS), prior PCI or CABG. CCAs were performed in 4 acquisition runs for the left coronary artery and 2 to 3 acquisition runs for the right coronary artery, whereas DARCAs were performed in a single run for each coronary artery., RESULTS: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were similar for both groups. The overall prevalence of CAD was 77.6%. The DARCA group had a significant reduction in the amount of contrast, 60 ml (IQR: 52.5-71.5 ml) versus 76 ml (IQR: 68-87 ml), P < 0.0001; and radiation dose by Air Kerma, 269.5 mGy (IQR: 176-450.5) versus 542.1 mGy (IQR: 370.7-720.8), P < 0.0001. There were fewer patients requiring additional projections in the DARCA group: 54.0% versus 75.0%; P = 0.002., CONCLUSIONS: In a population with a high prevalence of CAD, DARCA was safe and resulted in a significant decrease in contrast volume and radiation dose.

312,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
1479,"Preoperative chemoradiotherapy effects on anastomotic leakage after rectal cancer resection: A propensity score matching analysis OBJECTIVE:: To assess the effects of preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on anastomotic leakage (AL) after rectal cancer resection, using propensity score matching. BACKGROUND:: Conflicting data have emerged over the last decade regarding the effect of preoperative CRT on AL. METHOD(S):: We reviewed 1437 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection (LAR) at our institution between 2005 and 2012. AL evaluated as grade C was the primary endpoint, as proposed by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer in 2010. The patients were treated with (n = 360) or without (n = 1077) preoperative CRT. The total radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for the differences in some baseline characteristics. RESULT(S):: The preoperative CRT group contained more patients with the following characteristics, older age, male sex, smoker, advanced stage tumor, lower/mid rectal tumor location, ultra-LAR, and diverting stoma, than the non-preoperative CRT group (all Ps < 0.05). Postoperative AL occurred in 91 patients (6.3%). Before propensity score matching, the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 5.9%, respectively (P = 0.293). After propensity score matching, the 2 groups were nearly balanced except for the initial stage and the length of the surgeonE's career, and the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.781). CONCLUSION(S):: We did not observe that preoperative CRT increased the risk of postoperative AL after LAR in patients with rectal cancer, using propensity score matching analysis. © 2013 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",Excluded
476,"Increased radiation from Chernobyl decreases the expression of red colouration in natural populations of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) Pheomelanin is a pink to red version of melanin pigment deposited in skin and hair. Due to its bright colour, pheomelanin plays a crucial function in signalling, in particular sexual signalling. However, production of pheomelanin, as opposed to its dark alternative, eumelanin, bears costs in terms of consumption of antioxidants important for protection of DNA against naturally produced reactive oxidative species. Therefore, decreased expression of pheomelanin is expected in organisms exposed to severe oxidative stress such as that caused by exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. We tested if variable exposure to radiation among natural populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in Chernobyl affected expression of red colouration in their dorsal fur. The relative redness of dorsal fur was positively correlated with weight, but also negatively correlated with the level of background radiation. These results suggest that the development of the natural red colouration in adult bank voles is affected by ionizing background radiation, and potentially causing elevated levels of oxidative stress. Reduced production of pheomelanin allows more antioxidants to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by radiation. However, changing natural animal colouration for physiological reasons can have ecological costs, if e.g. it causes mismatch with habitat colouration and conspicuousness for predators.",Included
498,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

2286,"Safety of deferred CT imaging of intoxicated patients presenting with possible traumatic brain injury BACKGROUND: Patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status and alcohol intoxication can clinically resemble patients with an intracranial hemorrhage. Although intracranial hemorrhage is quickly excluded with a head computed tomographic (CT) scan, it is common practice to defer imaging and allow the patient to metabolize to spare ED resources and minimize radiation exposure to the patient. Although this reduces unnecessary scans, it may delay treatment in patients with occult intracranial hemorrhage, which some fear may increase morbidity and mortality. We sought to evaluate the safety of deferred CT imaging in these patients by evaluating whether time to scan significantly affects the rate of neurosurgical intervention., METHODS: In this retrospective medical record review, all clinically alcohol-intoxicated patients presenting to 2 university EDs were included. Time to order CT imaging, findings on imaging, and outcomes of these patients were determined. Patients were assessed in 3 groups: CT ordered within 1 hour of triage, CT ordered 1-3 hours from triage, and CT ordered 3 or more hours from triage., RESULTS: During the study period, 5943 patients were included in the study. Of these, 0 patients scanned in less than 3 hours had intracranial findings on imaging requiring neurosurgery, whereas 1 patient with a deferred CT scan required a neurosurgical intervention; however, it was not emergently performed., CONCLUSION: Routine CT scanning of alcohol-intoxicated patients with altered mental status is of low clinical value. Deferring CT imaging while monitoring improving clinical status appears to be a safe practice. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2757,"Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome) is linked to chromosome 9q34 Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (ataxia-telangiectasia-like syndrome [AOA]; MIM 208920) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, and choreoathetosis. These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34. This work will ultimately allow the disease gene to be identified and its relevance to other types of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias to be determined.",Excluded
1551,"Radiosurgical techniques and clinical outcomes of gamma knife radiosurgery for brainstem arteriovenous malformations OBJECTIVE: Brainstem arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is rare and radiosurgical management is complicated by the sensitivity of the adjacent neurological structures. Complete obliteration of the nidus is not always possible. We describe over 20 years of radiosurgical procedures for brainstem AVMs, focusing on clinical outcomes and radiosurgical techniques., METHODS: Between 1992 and 2011, the authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 464 cerebral AVMs. Twenty-nine of the 464 patients (6.3%) reviewed had brainstem AVMs. This series included sixteen males and thirteen females with a mean age of 30.7 years (range : 5-71 years). The symptoms that led to diagnoses were as follows : an altered mentality (5 patients, 17.3%), motor weakness (10 patients, 34.5%), cranial nerve symptoms (3 patients, 10.3%), headache (6 patients, 20.7%), dizziness (3 patients, 10.3%), and seizures (2 patients, 6.9%). Two patients had undergone a previous nidus resection, and three patients had undergone a previous embolization. Twenty-four patients underwent only GKRS. With respect to the nidus type and blood flow, the ratio of compact type to diffuse type and high flow to low flow were 17 : 12 and 16 : 13, respectively. In this series, 24 patients (82.8%) had a prior hemorrhage. The mean target volume was 1.7 cm(3) (range 0.1-11.3 cm(3)). The mean maximal and marginal radiation doses were 38.5 Gy (range 28.6-43.6 Gy) and 23.4 Gy (range 18-27 Gy), and the mean isodose profile was 61.3% (range 50-70%)., RESULTS: Twenty-four patients had brainstem AVMs and were followed for more than 3 years. Obliteration of the AVMs was eventually documented in 17 patients (70.8%) over a mean follow-up period of 77.5 months (range 36-216 months). With respect to nidus type and blood flow, the obliteration rate of compact types (75%) was higher than that of diffuse types (66.7%), and the obliteration rate of low flow AVMs (76.9%) was higher than that of high flow AVMs (63.6%) (p<0.05). Two patients (6.9%) with three hemorrhagic events suffered a hemorrhage during the follow-up period. The annual bleeding rate of AVM after GKRS was 1.95% per year. No adverse radiation effects or delayed cystic formations were found., CONCLUSION: GKRS has an important clinical role in treatment of brainstem AVMs, which carry excessive surgical risks. Angiographic features and radiosurgical techniques using a lower maximal dose with higher isodose profiles are important for lesion obliteration and the avoidance of complications.",Excluded

Chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 7q, and 11p were also significantly more affected. Some bands also showed a special sensitivity to radiation, and band 1q32 was the most affected. This band is proposed as a hot point"" for the clastogenic effect of ionizing radiation. A significant clustering of breakpoints in G bands was also found, especially at the telomeres, as previously described by other authors.

1047,"Epidemiological and clinical aspects in 1100 patients with plasmacytoma 1,100 patients at University of Freiburg Medical Center and at the Institute of Pathology with newly diagnosed plasmacytoma between 1943 and 1989 were identified. Records for these patients were reviewed and the incidence, association with age and employment, distribution of the sexes, tumor stage and survival time and development of secondary tumors were analyzed. The incidence rate of plasmacytoma is increasing within the last decades. Average annual incidence rate at the early 90ies was 6 per 100,000 population. Plasmacytoma mainly occurs in older patients and increases in incidence with age. The median age for diagnosis was 65 years for males and 68 years for females. 10% of patients are under 50 years of age at time of diagnosis. Neither significant association with employment nor association with exposure to hazardous goods could be seen. Males and females are affected 1:1. Secondary malignant tumors could be detected in 7,6%. If plasmacytoma is the secondary tumor, 50% of patients were treated before with ionizing radiation because of their first tumor.

1248,"Visualization of subsurface structures in cells and tissues by backscattered electron imaging A fraction of the beam electrons which interact with a specimen scatter back. The number of backscattered electrons (BE's) increases with the atomic number of the elements encountered. Cell and tissue structures lacking a heavy metal content yield few BE's compared to structures affixed with heavy metals, either vitally or by means of staining methods applied after fixation. The BE imaging mode of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) provides an intensity map of the BE yield from the specimen. BE imaging of selectively stained structures in cells and tissues renders these structures visible in contrast to the unstained surround. Since BE's can emerge from a significant depth within the material, BE imaging can be used to view such heavy metal stained structures beneath intact cell surfaces. The microcontours of the overlying surface can be viewed concurrently by using the surface scanning (i.e., the secondary electron imaging; SEI) mode of the microscope. Methods for selectively contrasting subsurface structures can be adapted from existing light microscope (LM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) methods. Staining methods have been devised for subsurface viewing of cell organelles, including nuclei, mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, and phagosomes. A physical model is presented which describes these observations and suggests future possible trends in this subject. Specifically the image contrast and resolution are described in terms of the physical properties of the stain and specimen and of the SEM operating conditions of energy and current.

Five patients were treated with open surgery, 12 with MIS-surgery. Nine patients were male, eight female. The age was between 19-69. During the surgery we quantify the operating time, the time made by the fluoroscope and the radiation dose. Postoperative we measured the length of the incision made during surgery. The follow up was 3, 6, 12 weeks. Result(s): The complication rate was quite low. The mean operating time was in an MIS-surgery 26,25 minutes/ open surgery 38,25. The mean fluoroscope time was in an MIS surgery 11,20 seconds/open surgery 24,6. The radiation dose was in an MIS-surgery 8,12 cGYcm2/open surgery 8,98.

2763,"A tactile display for International Space Station (ISS) extravehicular activity (EVA) Background: A tactile display to increase an astronaut's situational awareness during an extravehicular activity (EVA) has been developed and ground tested. The Tactor Locator System (TLS) is a non-intrusive, intuitive display capable of conveying position and velocity information via a vibrotactile stimulus applied to the subject's neck and torso. In the Earth's 1 G environment, perception of position and velocity is determined by the body's individual sensory systems. Under normal sensory conditions, redundant information from these sensory systems provides humans with an accurate sense of their position and motion. However, altered environments, including exposure to weightlessness, can lead to conflicting visual and vestibular cues, resulting in decreased situational awareness. The TLS was designed to provide somatosensory cues to complement the visual system during EVA operations. Method(s): An EVA task was simulated on a computer graphics workstation with a display of the International Space Station (ISS) and a target astronaut at an unknown location. Subjects were required to move about the ISS and acquire the target astronaut using either an auditory cue at the outset, or the TLS. Subjects used a 6 degree of freedom input device to command translational and rotational motion. The TLS was configured to act as a position aid, providing target direction information to the subject through a localized stimulus. Result(s): Results show that the TLS decreases reaction time (p = 0.001) and movement time (p = 0.001) for simulated subject (astronaut) motion around the ISS. Conclusion(s): The TLS is a useful aid in increasing an astronaut's situational awareness, and warrants further testing to explore other uses, tasks and configurations.",Excluded

2016,"Exogenous T3 mimics long day lengths in Siberian hamsters Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus) exhibit seasonal cycles of reproduction driven by changes in day length. Day length is encoded endogenously by the duration of nocturnal melatonin (Mel) secretion from the pineal gland. Short-duration Mel signals stimulate reproduction and long-duration signals inhibit reproduction. The mechanism by which Mel signals are decoded at the level of neural target tissues remains uncharacterized. In Siberian hamsters, exposure to short day lengths or injections of Mel in long days results in a decrease in hypothalamic expression of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2) mRNA. Dio2 catalyzes the conversion of the thyroid hormone thyroxine to triiodothyronine (T3). Thus exposure to short and long day lengths should decrease and increase hypothalamic T3 concentrations, respectively. We tested the hypothesis that exogenous T3 administered to short-day hamsters would mimic exposure to long day lengths with respect to gonadal stimulation. Hamsters gestated and raised in short day lengths that exhibited photoinhibition of the testes were given daily subutaneous injections of T3 or saline vehicle for 4 wk beginning at week 12 of life. The results indicate that exogenous T3 induced gonadal growth in short-day hamsters and delayed spontaneous gonadal development by an interval equal to the number of weeks during which T3 was administered. T3 injections delayed gonadal regression if given coincident with the transfer of hamsters from long to short day lengths. These results suggest that T3 mimics long day exposure in Siberian hamsters and may serve as an intermediate step between the Mel rhythm and the reproductive response.",Excluded

This study sets to evaluate its incidence and clinical predictive factors, and to propose relevant dosimetric constraints for this structure to guide radiotherapy planning., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of 797 NPC patients who underwent definitive intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) between 2003 and 2011. Cumulative incidence and clinical predictors for radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy were evaluated. Archived radiotherapy plans were retrieved and 330 independent hypoglossal nerves were retrospectively contoured following standardized atlas. Optimal threshold analyses of dosimetric parameters (Dmax, D0.5cc, D1cc, D2cc, Dmean) were conducted using receiver operating characteristic curves. Normal tissue complication probability was generated with logistic regression modeling., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 8.1years, sixty-nine (8.7%) patients developed radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy. High radiotherapy dose, premorbid diabetes, advanced T-stage and radiological hypoglossal canal involvement were independent clinical risk factors. Maximum dose received by 1cc volume (D1cc) was the best predictor for the development of radiation-induced nerve palsy (AUC=0.826) at 8years after IMRT. Hypoglossal nerves with D1cc of 74Gy EQD2 had an estimated palsy risk of 4.7%. Nerves with D1cc <74Gy EQD2 had significantly lower risk of palsy than those >=74Gy EQD2 (2.4% vs 20.8%, p <0.001)., CONCLUSION: Incidence of radiation-induced hypoglossal nerve palsy was high after definitive IMRT for NPC. D1cc <74Gy EQD2 can serve as a useful dose constraint to adopt during radiotherapy planning to limit palsy risk to <5% at 8years after IMRT. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

1572,"Mental Space Travel: Damage to Posterior Parietal Cortex Prevents Egocentric Navigation and Reexperiencing of Remote Spatial Memories The ability to navigate in a familiar environment depends on both an intact mental representation of allocentric spatial information and the integrity of systems supporting complementary egocentric representations. Although the hippocampus has been implicated in learning new allocentric spatial information, converging evidence suggests that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) might support egocentric representations. To date, however, few studies have examined long-standing egocentric representations of environments learned long ago. Here we tested 7 patients with focal lesions in PPC and 12 normal controls in remote spatial memory tasks, including 2 tasks reportedly reliant on allocentric representations (distance and proximity judgments) and 2 tasks reportedly reliant on egocentric representations (landmark sequencing and route navigation; see Rosenbaum, Ziegler, Winocur, Grady, & Moscovitch, 2004). Patients were unimpaired in distance and proximity judgments. In contrast, they all failed in route navigation, and left-lesioned patients also showed marginally impaired performance in landmark sequencing. Patients' subjective experience associated with navigation was impoverished and disembodied compared with that of the controls. These results suggest that PPC is crucial for accessing remote spatial memories within an egocentric reference frame that enables both navigation and reexperiencing. Additionally, PPC was found to be necessary to implement specific aspects of allocentric navigation with high demands on spontaneous retrieval. © 2010 American Psychological Association.",Excluded

402,"Underprediction of visibly complex chromosome aberrations by a recombinational-repair ('one-hit') model Purpose: Published low-LET FISH data were used to test two models of chromosome aberration production based on breakage-and-reunion or recombinational repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomness of DNA double strand break induction and misrejoining is analyzed comprehensively and adopted as a working hypothesis. Proximity effects are approximated by using interaction sites. Model results are calculated using CAS (chromosome aberration simulator) Monte Carlo computer software with two adjustable parameters. CAS can emulate the specifics of any experimental painting protocol, allowing very detailed tests of the models. Result(s): To reasonable approximation, breakage-and-reunion model predictions are consistent with low-LET FISH results, including two large, elaborate, one-paint data sets. An explicitly specified version of the recombinational-repair model severely underpredicts the frequency of the visibly complex aberration patterns most commonly observed with one-paint FISH, and is inconsistent with some observed multi-paint patterns. When high-dose effects (distortion and saturation) are taken into account quantitatively, a dose-response relation for apparently simple interchanges slightly favours the breakage-and-reunion model over the recombinational-repair model, despite being approximately linear over the dose range 2-6 Gy. Conclusion(s): The random breakage-and-reunion model gives comprehensive baseline predictions that are sufficiently accurate for the organization of experimental results. The data speak against complex aberrations being formed by the random recombinational repair pathway discussed here.",Excluded
864,"Preoperative CT angiography of prospective renal transplant recipients: Evaluation of safety of iso-osmolar nonionic intravascular contrast, imaging findings, and effects on management in a predialysis patient cohort Objective: Prospective renal transplant recipients with matched living donors require careful preoperative evaluation as a result of increased risk for aortoiliac atherosclerosis and venous thrombosis in addition to an increased incidence of renal carcinoma. We investigated the safety of CT angiography (CTA) in a predialysis cohort for evaluation of arterial and venous disease and other pathology that would alter management. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed the records of 40 potential renal transplant recipients (24 men and 16 women; age range, 23-79 years) who were investigated with CTA performed on 64-row MDCT scanners after 100 mL Iodixanol 320 (Visipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) IV contrast enhancement. Nonenhanced, arterial, and 2- minute delayed phase thin section (0.625-mm collimation) imaging was performed with 2-mm axial and multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering angiographic reconstructions. Pre- and post-CTA serum creatinine (Se Cr) levels were obtained and clinical status observed to time of transplant or up to 7 months post- CTA. Patients underwent pre- and post-CTA hydration as allowed by individual renal status. Result(s): All patients had diagnostic quality CTA studies. Sixteen patients (40%) had major aortoiliac arterial disease that influenced transplantation management or required additional therapy. Eight patients had renal tumors, polycystic kidneys, or other tumors requiring surgical therapy. CTA necessitated additional imaging tests in seven others. Mean pre- and posttransplant Se Cr were 5.2 (range, 2.9-14.1) and 5.1 (range, 2.4-14.2) respectively. Twenty-seven patients had stable or mean decreased Se Cr of 10.2% and 13 had mean increase of 6.3% (range, +/- 32%) post-CTA. No patient required dialysis as a result of CTA. Conclusion(s): CTA with a moderate dose of Iodixanol contrast is a safe and effective procedure with no major clinical impact on renal function in this predialysis population. CTA provided arterial and venous road maps and influenced transplantation management in 40%. Other important findings led to additional surgery in 22% of the group.",Excluded

Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.",Excluded
1587,"Radiosurgery for solitary brain metastases using the cobalt-60 gamma unit: methods and results in 24 patients To define the role of stereotactic radiosurgery in the treatment of metastatic brain tumors we treated 24 consecutive patients (20 men, 4 women) with the 201-source 60Co gamma unit between May 1988 and March 1990. The primary tumors included malignant melanoma (n = 10), non-small cell lung carcinoma (n = 6), renal cell carcinoma (n = 3), colorectal carcinoma (n = 1), oropharyngeal carcinoma (n = 1), and adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (n = 3). All tumors were less than or equal to 3.0 cm in greatest diameter. Twenty patients received a planned combination of 30-40 Gy whole brain fractionated irradiation and a radiosurgical ""boost"" of 16-20 Gy to the tumor margins; one patient refused conventional fractionated irradiation. Three patients with recurrent, persistent, or new non-small cell lung carcinomas had radiosurgical treatment 12-20 months after receiving 30-42.5 Gy whole-brain external beam irradiation. Stereotactic computed tomographic imaging was used for target coordinate determination and imaging-integrated dose planning. All tumors were enclosed by the 50-90% isodose shell using one (n = 22), two (n = 1), or three (n = 1) irradiation isocenters. During this 23-month period (median follow-up of 7 months) no patient died from progression of a radiosurgically-treated brain metastasis. Ten patients died of systemic disease (n = 8) or remote central nervous system metastasis (n = 2) between 1 week and 10 months after radiosurgery. One patient had tumor progression and underwent craniotomy and tumor excision 5 months after radiosurgery. To date, median survival after radiosurgery has been 10 months; 1-year survival was 33.3%. Stereotactic radiosurgery eliminated the surgical and anesthetic risks associated with craniotomy and resection of solitary brain metastases. Radiosurgery also effectively controlled the growth of tumors considered ""resistant"" to conventional irradiation.",Excluded
2562,"Less is More: The Impact of Multidisciplinary Thyroid Conference on the Treatment of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma BACKGROUND: In 2006, a multidisciplinary thyroid conference (MDTC) was implemented to better plan management of thyroid cancer patients at our institution. This study assessed the clinical impact of a MDTC on radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment patterns., METHODS: A prospective database (2003-2014) collected patient and tumor characteristics, RAI doses, and tumor recurrences. Patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma >=1 cm were stratified based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification. RAI regimens were compared before initiation of MDTC (2003-2005, n = 88), after establishment of MDTC (2007-2009, n = 95), and after the release of 2009 ATA guidelines (2011-2014, n = 181). RAI doses were defined as low (<=75 mCi), intermediate (76-150 mCi), and high (>150 mCi)., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who received high-dose RAI after implementation of MDTC compared to before initiation of MDTC in the intermediate and high-risk patient groups (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01) without an associated increase in tumor recurrence (11 vs. 7%, p = 0.74). On multivariable analysis, presentation of a patient at MDTC was a negative predictor for receiving high-dose RAI (p = 0.002). As might be expected, there was also a significant decrease in use of RAI after the 2009 ATA guidelines were issued compared to after implementation of MDTC (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with implementation of a thyroid malignancy multidisciplinary conference, we observed significantly decreased postoperative dosing of RAI without increased tumor recurrence. The 2009 ATA guidelines were associated with a further decrease in RAI administration. Treatment for patients with thyroid carcinoma is optimized by a multidisciplinary approach.",Excluded
2841,"The human leulocyte test system. VII. Further investigations concerning micronucleus-derived premature chromosome condensation Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%. Staining of centromeric heterochromatin in micronuclei reveal a frequency of micronuclei with centromeric heterochromatin resembling the frequency of G2-phase PCC found in mitoses.",Excluded

Five- and 10-year local control (LC) rates were 73% and 67%, respectively. Acute and late G3-G4 toxicity rates were 32% and 12%, respectively. Two patients underwent a colostomy for a G4 anal toxicity. This study confirms the outcomes of RT +/- CT in the treatment of anal canal cancer. Concomitant CT and LC statistically influenced Overall Survival and Colostomy-Free Survival. CT also statistically reduced the risk of nodal relapse.

3378,"Axon initial segment Kv1 channels control axonal action potential waveform and synaptic efficacy Action potentials are binary signals that transmit information via their rate and temporal pattern. In this context, the axon is thought of as a transmission line, devoid of a role in neuronal computation. Here, we show a highly localized role of axonal Kv1 potassium channels in shaping the action potential waveform in the axon initial segment (AIS) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons independent of the soma. Cell-attached recordings revealed a 10-fold increase in Kv1 channel density over the first 50 microm of the AIS. Inactivation of AIS and proximal axonal Kv1 channels, as occurs during slow subthreshold somatodendritic depolarizations, led to a distance-dependent broadening of axonal action potentials, as well as an increase in synaptic strength at proximal axonal terminals. Thus, Kv1 channels are strategically positioned to integrate slow subthreshold signals, providing control of the presynaptic action potential waveform and synaptic coupling in local cortical circuits.",Excluded
870,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients. No radiation colitis or neuropathy occurred. Moderate-dose IORT and EBRT is safe, taking into account related late toxicities. It is an effective local treatment approach, resulting in an encouraging local control rate.",Excluded
3009,"Irradiation and free tissue transfer in head and neck cancer The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of surgery, irradiation, and free tissue transfer in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients. Forty-one patients with head and neck cancer were treated with surgery, irradiation, and free tissue transfer for reconstruction from 1977 to 1987. The age range was 38 to 78 years with a median age of 61. Patients were staged using the AJCC (1978) staging system. Eighty-four percent of the patients were in stage III or IV. The common sites of primary tumors were the oral cavity (22) and oropharynx (10). Forty patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 1 patient had basal cell carcinoma. Six patients had preoperative irradiation, and the rest had postoperative irradiation. The most common surgical procedures were partial glossectomy and neck dissection (17 patients) and wide excision of the primary and neck dissection (17 patients). The most common types of free tissue transfer were dorsalis pedis (13 patients) and scapular flaps (6 patients). The primary site was controlled in 22 patients (54%) and the neck in 36 patients (88%). Three patients (7.3%) had flap failure which required further surgical management. Eighteen patients are living with no evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 18 months (5-101 months), 10 patients are living with disease with a median follow-up of 9 months (3-40 months), 9 patients are dead of disease with a median survival of 13 months (6-54 months), and 4 patients are lost for follow-up.

1299,"ID: 3522009 NON-RADIATION EUS-BASED ERCP FOR CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS Background: ERCP inherently involves ionizing radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. Non-radiation EUS-based ERCP was developed and previously reported by our group. We assessed the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of non-radiation ERCP in consecutive patients with choledocholithiasis. Method(s): Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients treated by non-radiation -ERCP over a 33-month period (February 2018 to November 2020). Exclusion criteria: Surgically altered anatomy. Prior to ERCP, EUS with a standard echoendoscope was performed to document the presence, number, and size of stones. The echoendoscope was exchanged for a duodenoscope. Free-hand deep cannulation with an ultra-tapered tip sphincterotome was performed without fluoroscopy. Bile duct access was verified by visible bile aspiration. Aspiration of clear fluid indicated pancreatic duct (PD) cannulation. Precut was performed if the PD was cannulated 3 times. For stone extraction, a sphincterotomy length tailored to stone size was performed using pure cutting current. Stone(s) were removed using a 22mm Dormia basket. Clearance was confirmed by water irrigation method (water ""gush"") with optional cholangioscopy. The number of stones extracted was matched to the number seen on EUS. Result(s): Non-radiation ERCP was performed in 55 consecutive patients (69.10+17.56yrs, 20M:35F) by a single operator (KFB). Bile duct cannulation was successful in all (100%). Precut was performed in 9 patients. Complete stone removal was achieved in all. Procedural time was 24+23 min with 100% technical success. Follow up was 39 + 24 weeks in 35 patients: 35 had no adverse events and remained asymptomatic (1 patient deceased at 8 weeks post procedure). Follow-up incomplete in 20 patients. Limitation(s): Single center, single operator, retrospective study Conclusion(s): EUS-based ERCP for choledocholithiasis was technically feasible and successful in all consecutive patients and without adverse events in patients with follow-up.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
1671,"68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT, and whole-body MR imaging in detection of neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective trial Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients (34-77 y old; mean, 54.3 +/- 10.4 y old; 10 men and 9 women) underwent SSRS SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and WB DWI. Images were acquired with a maximum interval of 3 mo between them and were analyzed with masking by separate teams. Planar whole-body imaging and SPECT/CT were performed from thorax to pelvis using a double-head 16-slice SPECT/CT scanner 4 h after injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed from head to feet using a 16-slice PET/CT scanner 45 min after injection of 185 MBq of tracer. WB DWI was performed in the coronal plane using a 1.5-T scanner and a body coil. The standard method of reference for evaluation of image performance was undertaken: consensus among investigators at the end of the study, clinical and imaging follow-up, and biopsy of suggestive lesions., There are different metabolic imaging methods, various tracers, and emerging anatomic modalities to stage neuroendocrine tumor (NET). We aimed to compare NET lesion detectability among 99mTc-hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-octreotide (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy [SSRS]) SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and whole-body diffusion-weighted MR imaging (WB DWI)., Results: McNemar testing was applied to evaluate the detectability of lesions using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in comparison to SSRS SPECT/CT and WB DWI: a significant difference in detectability was noted for pancreas (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455, respectively), gastrointestinal tract (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455), and bones (P = 0.0082 and P = 0.0082). Two unknown primary lesions were identified solely by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, SSRS SPECT/CT, and WB DWI demonstrated, respectively, sensitivities of 0.96, 0.60, and 0.72; specificities of 0.97, 0.99, and 1.00; positive predictive values of 0.94, 0.96, and 1.00; negative predictive values of 0.98, 0.83, and 0.88; and accuracies of 0.97, 0.86, and 0.91., Conclusion: 68Ga PET/CT seems to be more sensitive for detection of well-differentiated NET lesions, especially for bone and unknown primary lesions. NET can be staged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. WB DWI is an efficient new method with high accuracy and without ionizing radiation exposure. SSRS SPECT/CT should be used only when 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and WB DWI are not available.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
2820,"A randomized study to assess the effectiveness of orally administered pilocarpine during and after radiotherapy of head and neck cancer BACKGROUND: This prospective randomized study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of oral pilocarpine chloratum (Salagen) during and after radiotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1999 and December 2003, 66 patients received 60 Gy of irradiation to their head and neck cancer. Half of the patients received 5 mg oral pilocarpine 3 times a day from the beginning of radiotherapy over a period of 12 weeks. The control group received similar doses of pilocarpine only in the second 6 weeks following irradiation. Patient saliva secretion was recorded, and a visual analog scale measuring overall and daily xerostomia, difficulty in sleeping, speaking, eating and wearing dentures was employed., RESULTS: Pilocarpine, given concomitantly with radiotherapy, statistically improved the salivary flow and induced better patient comfort by the end of radiotherapy. Patient comfort and symptoms related to xerostomia greatly decreased compared to patients receiving pilocarpine after irradiation in the second 6-week period of therapy. The patients' quality of life, saliva production and symptoms related to xerostomia showed significant progress by the end of the 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that stimulated salivary glands suffer less decrease in saliva production during radiotherapy. The stimulated saliva flow reduced the side-effects of irradiation.",Excluded
1317,"Kypho-IORT: Intraoperative radiotherapy in spinal metastases: Nine-month clinical results BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A new technique of combined kyphoplasty and intraoperative radiation therapy (Kypho-IORT) was introduced in 2010 [1]. The indication, rationale and possible advantages have been published in 2011 [2]. In the first clinical period several technical improvements and modifications could stabilize the method, its clinical feasibility and shortterm safety has been shown [3]. Due to the higher local radiation doses compared to extracorporal radiotherapy (EBRT) permitted by the steep dose fall off of the IORT-source a higher local tumor control can potentially be achieved by Kypho-IORT. In this study we present an intermediate prospective follow-up of 9-month after Kypho-IORT. PURPOSE: Local tumor control and clinical use of Kypho-IORT. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Evidence level IV: prospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: 62 patients suffering from 77 spinal metastases which were treated with Kypho-IORT were included in the prospective study. Data of 16 patients who finished the 4th follow-up appointment after around 9 months and were interpreted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired basic data were gender, age at surgery, tumor entity, treated vertebral level, delivered dose. Prospective collected data were pain measure by visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperative and at follow-up, Karnofsky Index, local metastasis control in the treated vertebra and general progression of metastases by CT or MRI. METHOD(S): Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. RESULT(S): 16 patients (12 females, 4 males) with an average age of 61 years were included. Twelve patients had breast cancer, two patients suffered prostate cancer and one each with lung, ovarian and sigmoid cancer. Thirteen thoracic and 4 lumbar vertebrae were treated with an average surgical time of 70 minutes per vertebra. The time from surgery to the 9-month follow-up was in average 348 days. The Karnofsky index was constant with 87 preoperative versus 86 at follow-up. The VAS average decreased from 4.1 preoperative to 1.4 postoperative and 0.8 at follow-up. In all cases but two, a dose of 8gy in a radius of 5mm was delivered successfully, two cases with second dose level at 8gy in 8mm distance to isocenter. Three patients had a local progress, one patient due to incorrect indication. Two vertebrae needed open revision surgery; one local progress was treated only with EBRT. Eight patients showed a general tumor progress. CONCLUSION(S): Kypho-IORT can offer a fast postoperative pain reduction, immediate stabilization and prevention of secondary fractures in the treated vertebrae by kyphoplasty which could be confirmed in this small cohort. The VAS decreased postoperative and this level was maintained during follow-up. Local tumor control (indication failures ignored) by intraoperative radiation could be achieved in 87% of the vertebrae over the 9 months period, which seems to be better than single fraction radiation schedules and at least comparable to multiple fraction schedules of conventional radiation. Furthermore the Karnofsky-Index stayed constant over the follow-up period which proves the low morbidity of the intervention in short and in intermediate term. All 14 of 16 patients of the 9-month-follow- up were treated with the lowest calculated treatment dose; probably an even higher local tumor control is achievable by higher local radiation doses.These results warrant further evaluation of this technique by a dose escalation and a multicenter study, which is currently under way.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: A total of 222 prospectively analyzed patients with various HN malignancies were treated with conventional and intensity-modulated RT. Stimulated individual parotid gland flow rates were measured before RT and 1 year after RT using Lashley cups at both centers. A flow ratio <25% of pretreatment was defined as a complication. The data were fitted to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Result(s): A total of 384 parotid glands (Michigan: 157; Utrecht: 227 glands) was available for analysis 1 year after RT. Combined NTCP analysis based on mean dose resulted in a TD50 (uniform dose leading to 50% complication probability) of 39.9 Gy and m (steepness of the curve) of 0.40. The resulting NTCP curve had good qualitative agreement with the combined clinical data. Mean doses of 25-30 Gy were associated with 17-26% NTCP. Conclusion(s): A definite NTCP curve for parotid gland function 1 year after RT is presented, based on mean dose. No threshold dose was observed, and TD50 was equal to 40 Gy.

2787,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for essential tremor: Retrospective analysis of a 19-year experience Background: Essential Tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder that can be disabling. Initial treatment is in the form of medical therapies. Patients with medically refractory ET seek surgical intervention which include radiofrequency thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, and radiosurgical thalamotomy. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is a minimally invasive surgical option which is especially valuable for elderly and high surgical risk patients. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients suffering from medically refractory essential tremor. Method(s): During a 19-year period (1996-2015), 73 patients underwent gamma knife thalamotomy for intractable essential tremor. A median central dose of 140 Gy (range, 130-150) was delivered to the nucleus ventralis intermedius through a single 4-mm isocenter. We used the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale to score tremor, handwriting, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. The median time to last follow-up was 28 months (range, 6-152). Result(s): After gamma knife thalamotomy, 93.2% improved in tremor. Forty-four patients (60.3%) experienced tremor arrest or barely perceptible tremor. Eighteen patients (24.7%) noted tremor arrest and complete restoration of motor function. Tremor improvement was sustained at last follow-up in 96% of patients who experience tremor relief. Mean tremor score improved from 3.19 before to 1.27 after gamma knife thalamotomy (P < 0.0001). Mean handwriting score improved from 2.97 to 1.25 (P < 0.0001). Mean drawing score improved from 3.16 to 1.26 (P < 0.0001). Mean drinking score improved from 3.14 to 1.56 (P < 0.0001). Imaging follow-up showed three types of lesions: enhancing lesion, streaking along internal capsule on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and significant reactive changes. Three patients (4%) experienced temporary adverse radiation effects.

Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with locally advanced squamous cancers (stage IV, 98%; N2/3, 81%) were treated on an intensive regimen consisting of 5-day (120-hour) infusions of paclitaxel (20 mg/m2/d) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d), oral hydroxyurea 500 mg every 12 hours for 11 doses, and radiation 1.5 Gy bid (T-FH2X). Chemoradiation was administered concomitantly on days 1 to 5 of each 14-day cycle. A full treatment course consisted of five cycles during a 10-week period to a total radiation dose of 72 to 75 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up for the group is 34 months. At 3 years, progression-free survival is 63%, locoregional control is 86%, and systemic control is 79%; overall survival is 60%. Seventeen patients died of recurrent cancer, two died of second primary cancers, and four died of other causes. Side effects observed include anemia (22% required transfusion), leucopenia (34%, grade 3 to 4), and mucositis (84%, grade 3 to 4). Organ preservation principles were maintained. At 1 year posttreatment, 61% of patients had severe xerostomia and 47% had compromised swallowing. There was little disturbance of speech quality in 97% of patients at the same follow-up point. Conclusion(s): T-FH2X is a highly active and tolerable concomitant chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen that induces sustained local tumor control and holds promise for improved survival with organ preservation in high-risk patients. Identification of less toxic therapy and improved distant disease control are needed. T-FH2X should be tested in a randomized trial and compared with a less intensive concomitant regimen that uses once-daily radiation fractionation. © 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
324,"Feasibility and acute efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter guided by real-time 3D TEE Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acute efficacy of real-time 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT3DTEE)guided ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CVTI). Background(s): The use of RT3DTEE to guide a transcatheter radiofrequency ablation procedure has never been systematically investigated. Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with CVTI-dependent atrial flutter underwent CVTI ablation. Procedural monitoring using RT3DTEE was assigned to patients who requested general anesthesia for the procedure (n = 21 [30%]). In the other 49 patients (the control group), the procedures were monitored using the standard fluoroscopic approach. Procedural time was considered as skin-to-skin electrophysiological procedure duration, not including anesthesia preparation; adequate radiofrequency ablation applications (with fixed temperature and power settings) were considered as lesions lasting < 60 s. Result(s): RT3DTEE allowed visualization of the CVTI and identified related structures in most patients (20 of 21); anatomic features such as long CVTI (n = 11), prominent Eustachian ridge (n = 9), prominent Eustachian valve (n = 6), septal recess (n = 8), and pectinate muscles (n = 10) were frequent. Also, RT3DTEE allowed continuous visualization of ablation catheter movement and contact. Compared with the control group, RT3DTEE was equally effective in achieving CVTI bidirectional block (100% in both groups), and no complications occurred. RT3DTEE shortened procedural time (median 73.0 min, interquartile range [IQR] 60.0 to 90.0 min, vs. median 115.0 min, IQR 85.0 to 133.0 min, p < 0.001), reduced radiation exposure (median fluoroscopy time 4.2 min, IQR 3.1 to 8.4 min, vs. median 19.3 min, IQR 12.9 to 36.4 min, p < 0.001; median fluoroscopy dose 575.4 cGy . cm2, IQR 428.5 to 1,299.4 cGy . cm2, vs. median 3,520.7 cGy . cm2, IQR 1,700.0 to 6,709.0 cGy . cm2, p < 0.001), and reduced the number of radiofrequency applications to achieve bidirectional block (median 7, IQR 6 to 10, vs. median 12, IQR 10 to 22, p = 0.007). A strong learning curve was detected by comparing procedural data between the first and last patients treated using RT3DTEE. Conclusion(s): RT3DTEE-guided ablation of CVTI was feasible, allowing real-time detailed morphological CVTI characterization as well as continuous visualization of the ablation catheter during radiofrequency ablation. This approach entailed marked reductions in procedural time, radiation exposure, and the number of radiofrequency applications. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded

3024,"[Technique and radiation dose of conventional X-rays and computed tomography of the sacroiliac joint] Anterior-posterior (a.p.) or posterior-anterior X-rays of the sacroiliac joint, sometimes supplemented by a transverse view, have been the method of choice for diagnosis of patients suspected of having sacroiliitis. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional X-rays are relatively low, which can delay the diagnosis of sacroiliitis. Computed tomography (CT) is superior to conventional X-rays for diagnosis of sacroiliitis, but does emit a relatively higher dose of radiation. For this reason, particularly for females, CT should be optimized by employing semi-coronal planes which require a lower radiation dose than axial planes. CT in a semi-coronal plane causes minimal radiation to the ovaries, and the effective radiation dose for women might even be lower than with conventional AP X-rays. Therefore, for suspected sacroiliitis in young women, CT in the semi-coronal plane is the preferred imaging method with respect to diagnostics and radiation protection when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available. Male gonads can be protected from radiation doses in conventional X-rays, and CT as the primary imaging method can only be justified in these cases because of its better diagnostic capabilities. Due to the lack of inherent risk factors, MRI is superior to CT for diagnostics since it provides images of inflammatory signs in addition to joint destruction. Thus, when available, MRI should be given preference for diagnosis of sacroiliitis.",Excluded
222,"Pictorial review of multidetector CT imaging of the preoperative evaluation of congenital heart disease Sequential segmental approach is an efficient method for complete evaluation of complex congenital heart diseases (CHD). Although echocardiography is the imaging technique of choice, recent advances in computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance have given a new dimension to the traditional diagnostic assessment of CHD. CT has advantages of fast speed, higher spatial resolution, and simultaneous lung and airway visualization. The purpose of this pictorial review is to discuss the role of CT and emphasize its protocol and the segmental approach for comprehensive assessment of CHD. Copyright © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

1731,"Retreatment of vestibular schwannomas with Gamma Knife surgery OBJECT: The response rate of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) to radiosurgery has reached the 97% level in several published series. When failure rarely occurs, some controversy has existed as to whether the tumor has to be resected or can be safely retreated with radiosurgery. The authors retrospectively studied the outcome of retreating 11 patients with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS)., METHODS: The authors studied 11 patients at the New England Gamma Knife Center who had undergone GKS as a second radiosurgical treatment for VS from 1994 to 2007. One patient underwent proton-beam radiotherapy as the first treatment, and the other 10 patients had undergone GKS initially. Tumor control (size before and after the first and the second treatment) was evaluated using MR imaging to demonstrate the course after the 2 treatments. Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grading system), trigeminal nerve function, hearing (Gardner-Robertson classification), and any adverse radiation effects were evaluated. The prescription dose was 12 Gy (11-13.2 Gy) for both treatments., RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 2 showed increase, 1 had no change, and, in 8, the VS decreased in size after the retreatment. One tumor remained unchanged over the first 6 months, but demonstrated signs of internal necrosis. All patients demonstrated stable facial nerve function. Regarding facial numbness, 2 patients experienced increases, 8 no change, and 1 decreased numbness. There was no functional hearing prior to the second treatment in 10 patients, and hearing was impaired in 1 patient. Adverse radiation effects (slight peduncular edema) were seen in 2 patients after the second treatment, and 1 patient had edema after the first treatment as well., CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular schwannomas can be retreated with GKS with good tumor control response and low risk of toxicity.",Excluded
1173,"Indwelling voice prosthesis insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction Objectives: Total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction is often performed in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. However, postoperative speechlessness significantly decreases patient quality of life. We investigated whether Provox insertion could preserve speech after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Method(s): A total of 130 cases of secondary Provox insertions after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction were analyzed. Communication outcomes were compared using the Head and Neck Cancer Understandability of Speech Subscale. Outcomes and complications associated with insertion site (jejunal insertion vs. esophageal insertion) and adjuvant irradiation therapy were also evaluated. Result(s): Provox insertion had favorable communication outcomes in 102 cases (78.4%). Neither the insertion site nor irradiation affected the communication outcome. Complications were observed in 20 cases (15.4%). Local infection was the most common complication. Free jejunal insertion, in which the resection range was enlarged, had a lower complication rate than did esophageal insertion, and its complication rate was unaffected by previous irradiation. For all patients, the hospitalization duration and duration of speechlessness were 13.4 days and 14.6 months, respectively. Patients receiving jejunal insertions had a significantly shorter hospitalization duration than did those receiving esophageal insertions. Unlike Provox2, ProvoxVega significantly reduced the complication rate to zero. Conclusion(s): For jejunal inserson of a Provox prosthetic, a sufficient margin can be maintained during total pharyngolaryngectomy and irradiation can be performed, and satisfactory communication outcomes were observed. Provox insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction should be considered the standard therapy for voice restoration.

765,"Sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients., METHODS: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

2941,"Radiation-induced comet-formation in human skin fibroblasts from radiotherapy patients with different normal tissue reactions Background: In clinical radiotherapy most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side effects. However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included
1293,"Racial disparities in receipt of standard chemoradiation in anal squamous cell carcinoma, an analysis of the National Cancer Database Background: Standard treatment for locally advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) consists of concurrent chemoradiation. We evaluated whether racial differences exist in the receipt of standard treatment and its association with survival. Method(s): From the National Cancer Database, we identified patients diagnosed with anal SCC (Stages 2-3) between 2004 and 2015. Using logistic regression, we evaluated racial differences in the probability of receiving standard chemoradiation. We used Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate associations between race, receipt of standard therapy and survival. Result(s): Our analysis included 19,835 patients. Patients receiving standard chemoradiation had better survival than patients receiving nonstandard therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.68; p < 0.001). Compared to White patients, Black patients were less likely to receive standard therapy (odds ratio [OR] 0.85; 95% CI 0.76-0.96; p < 0.008). We observed no statistical difference in mortality between Black and White patients overall (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.15; p = 0.24). However, for the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, Black patients had an increased mortality risk compared to White patients (HR 1.17, CI 1.01-1.35; p = 0.034). We observed no survival differences in the subgroup of patients receiving standard treatment (HR 1.00, CI 0.90-1.11, p = 0.99). Conclusion(s): Standard treatment in anal SCC is associated with better survival, but Black patients are less likely to receive standard treatment than White patients. Although Black patients had higher mortality than White patients in the subgroup of patients receiving nonstandard therapy, this difference was ameliorated in the subset receiving standard therapy.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

A change is produced in the metabolism of vitamin D in elderly people although its study has received little attention in many countries., METHODS: With the aim of evaluating vitamin D and its metabolites in the elderly people with hip fracture in our geographic environment (Madrid, Spain), 58 patients with hip fracture over the age of 70, and 39 subjects without a fracture or the similar age were studied. Both groups were evaluated during the season of minimum solar irradiation. The plasma concentrations of intact PTH and the serum concentrations of calcidiol and calcitriol were studied in all the patients., RESULTS: The patients with hip fracture presented significantly lower concentrations of calcidiol (11.7 +/- 6.4 vs. 18.4 +/- 12.7 nmol/l) and calcitriol (60.1 +/- 24.7 vs. 76.1 +/- 25.0 pmol/l) than in elderly persons without fracture, with similar PTH values being observed in both groups (4.8 +/- 1.9 vs. 5.1 +/- 2.3 pmol/l)., CONCLUSIONS: Although Madrid, Spain is considered to be a geographical area of high solar irradiation, the elderly population studied presented a vitamin D deficiency which was found to be greater in those with hip fracture.",Excluded
1518,"Radiosensitizing effects of miR-18a-5p on lung cancer stem-like cells via downregulating both ATM and HIF-1alpha Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer mortality globally. Most patients received radiotherapy during the course of disease. However, radioresistance generally occurs in the majority of these patients, leading to poor curative effect, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, miR-18a-5p expression was downregulated in irradiated lung cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-18a-5p increased the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells and inhibited the growth of A549 xenografts after radiation exposure. Dual luciferase report system and miR-18a-5p overexpression identified ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) as the targets of miR-18a-5p. The mRNA and protein expressions of ATM and HIF-1alpha were dramatically downregulated by miR-18a-5p in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, plasma miR-18a-5p expression was significantly higher in radiosensitive than in radioresistant group (P < .001). The cutoff value of miR-18a-5p >2.28 was obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in miR-18a-5p-high group than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P < .001). A tendency demonstrated that the median local progression-free survival (PFS) from radiotherapy was longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .082). The median overall survival (OS) from radiotherapy was numerically longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .281). The sensitivity and specificity of plasma miR-18a-5p to predict radiosensitivity was 87% and 95%, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-18a-5p increases the radiosensitivity in lung cancer cells and CD133+ stem-like cells via downregulating ATM and HIF-1alpha expressions. Plasma miR-18a-5p would be an available indicator of radiosensitivity in lung cancer patients. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2250,"Doses to carotid arteries after modern radiation therapy for hodgkin lymphoma: Is stroke still a late effect of treatment? Purpose Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors are at an increased risk of stroke because of carotid artery irradiation. However, for early-stage HL involved node radiation therapy (INRT) reduces the volume of normal tissue exposed to high doses. Here, we evaluate 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and proton therapy (PT) delivered as INRT along with the extensive mantle field (MF) by comparing doses to the carotid arteries and corresponding risk estimates. Methods and Materials We included a cohort of 46 supradiaphragmatic stage I-II classical HL patients. All patients were initially treated with chemotherapy and INRT delivered as 3D-CRT (30 Gy). For each patient, we simulated MF (36 Gy) and INRT plans using VMAT and PT (30 Gy). Linear dose-response curves for the 20-, 25-, and 30-year risk of stroke were derived from published HL data. Risks of stroke with each technique were calculated for all patients. Statistical analyses were performed with repeated measures analysis of variance. Results The mean doses to the right and left common carotid artery were significantly lower with modern treatment compared with MF, with substantial patient variability. The estimated excess risk of stroke after 20, 25, and 30 years was 0.6%, 0.86%, and 1.3% for 3D-CRT; 0.67%, 0.96%, and 1.47% for VMAT; 0.61%, 0.96%, and 1.33% for PT; and 1.3%, 1.72%, and 2.61% for MF. Conclusions INRT reduces the dose delivered to the carotid arteries and corresponding estimated risk of stroke for HL survivors. Even for the subset of patients with lymphoma close to the carotid arteries, the estimated risk is low. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2064,"Sun-induced changes of stratum corneum hydration vary with age and gender in a normal Chinese population BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Previous studies have demonstrated that sun-induced alteration of epidermal permeability barrier function varies with gender and age. In the present study, we assess the stratum corneum (SC) hydration in sun-exposed males and females., METHODS: A total of 168 subjects (84 males and 84 females) aged 19-75 years were enrolled. A multifunctional skin physiology monitor was used to measure SC hydration., RESULTS: In comparison with non-sun exposure, sun exposure does not cause a significant change in SC hydration in either young males or young females, whereas in aged females, a significant reduction of SC hydration is seen on the forehead and the dorsal hand of sun-exposed subjects. SC hydration on the canthus of both aged males and aged females is significantly lower than that of young subjects. Additionally, SC hydration on the dorsal hand of aged females is also significantly lower as compared with young females. Sun-induced reduction of SC hydration is more evident on the dorsal hand of aged females than that of males (P<0.001). Moreover, the SC rehydration capacity is significantly lower in sun-exposed aged females than in age-matched males., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that sun-induced changes of the SC hydration property vary with age and gender.

2023,"Expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice The aim is to clarify expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice. A mouse model of gamma-ray induced leukemia was produced, and by means of quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the expression of mRNA and protein, phosphorylation level, and protein activity of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells were investigated in these mice. The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.",Included
1404,"In vitro fertilization rate of mouse oocytes with spermatozoa from the F1 offspring of males irradiated with 1.0 Gy 137Cs gamma-rays Previous studies suggest that the spermatozoa from acutely irradiated male mice exhibit a reduced fertilization rate in vitro with the maximum decrease occurring for spermatozoa produced 6 weeks after irradiation (Y. Matsuda et al., Mutation Res. 142 (1985) 59-63). We have found that spermatozoa from unirradiated F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation also exhibit a significantly reduced fertilization rate in vitro. After acute 137Cs gamma-irradiation yielding an absorbed dose of 1.0 Gy, adult CD1 F0 male mice were mated at weekly intervals with unirradiated female CD1 mice. Unirradiated adult males from F1 litters conceived 5 and 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation were allowed to mature. Their epididymal spermatozoa were evaluated for in vitro fertilization rates using oocytes from unirradiated 8-12-week-old CD1 females. The mean fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (80.74 +/- 15.74 SD %, n = 5) did not differ significantly from the control fertilization rate (89.40 +/- 10.94 SD %, n = 8). However, the fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (56.14 +/- 21.93 SD %, n = 5) was significantly less than the fertilization rate for control spermatozoa (p < 0.006) or for that of the F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (p < 0.04). These data suggest that spermatozoa obtained 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation can transmit a decrease in fertilization rate to the F1 generation males as well as exhibit decreased fertilization rate themselves when tested directly in vitro.",Excluded
1992,"Evaluation of PRRT after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery as established technique ('Aretaieion' Protocol) using 111In-DTPA-Phe1 octreotide in inoperable liver metastases due to neuroendocrine tumors Aim/Introduction: To evaluate the efficacy of Auger and Internal Conversion Electron Emission of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide and their tumoricidal effectiveness due to their high LET, in inoperable liver metastases, positive for sst2 receptor over-expression (verified by Octreoscan and confirmed by biopsy) due to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Material(s) and Method(s): In 86 patients 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide was implemented after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery, in an average activity of 6.3+/-1.3 GBq per patient/ per session, consecutively, with a time interval between sessions of 6-8 weeks. Infusion repetition did not exceed the 12 sessions. Patients, being under repeated Sandostatin-LAR treatment (30 mg per 20 days) did not discontinued the dosage but they were intramuscularly injected 15-20 days prior to the radioactive session. To reduce myelotoxicity, 75 mg of DTPA in trip-trop diluted in about 200 ml normal saline water was infused 30 min before the initialization of the radiopeptide therapy, lasting for about 4 hrs. For the assessment of response, RECIST 1.1 standards were used. CT/MRI scans before, during and after the end of the whole procedure, as well as U/S images at monthly basis were performed. Absorbed doses delivered to metastases, kidneys and red marrow were calculated according to OLINDA/EXM 1.1 program. Toxicity (World Health Organization criteria) was measured using blood and urine tests of renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. Result(s): Three patients resulted in complete response (3.5%); partial response was assessed in 46 (53.5 %), disease stabilization in 21 (24.4 %) and progressive disease in 16 (18.6%). The median PFS and OS were estimated to be 32 and 47.5 months, respectively. The organ average radiation dose was estimated as follows: (a) Liver Tumor 15.2 mGy/MBq, (b) Liver 0.14 mGy/MBq, (c) Kidneys 0.41 mGy/ MBq, (d) Spleen 1.4 mGy/MBq and (f ) Bone marrow 0.0032 mGy/MBq. The average absorbed dose per session to a tumour for a spherical mass of 10 gr was estimated to be 10.8 mGy/MBq, depending on the histotype of the tumour. WHO toxicity grade 2 to 3 erythro-, leuko-and thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 (10.5%) cases observed about after the 3rd session. Conclusion(s): In unresectable metastatic liver lesions, positive for somatostatin receptors, repeated, transhepatic high doses of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide resulted in an optimal therapeutic outcome with a disease control (CR+PR+SD) in an about 82 % of the treated patients. Thus, 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide, intra-arterially applied, can be considered as a potent candidate in the therapeutic pharetra against NETs.",Excluded
885,"Lung dosimetry of inhaled radon progeny in mice Biological response of exposure to radon progeny has long been investigated, but there are only few studies in which absorbed doses in lungs of laboratory animals were estimated. The present study is the first attempt to calculate the doses of inhaled radon progeny for mice. For reference, the doses for rats and humans were also computed with the corresponding models. Lung deposition of particles, their clearance, and energy deposition of alpha particles to sensitive tissues were systematically simulated. Absorbed doses to trachea and bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, alveolar-interstitial regions, and whole lung were first provided as a function of monodisperse radon progeny particles with an equilibrium equivalent radon concentration of 1 Bq m(-3) (equilibrium factor, 0.4 and unattached fraction, 0.01). Based on the results, absorbed doses were then calculated for (1) a reference mine condition and (2) a condition previously used for animal experiments. It was found that the whole lung doses for mice, rats, and humans were 34.8, 20.7, and 10.7 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the mine condition, respectively, while they were 16.9, 9.9, and 6.5 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the animal experimental condition. In both cases, the values for mice are about 2 times higher than those for rats, and about 3 times higher than those for humans. Comparison of our data on rats and humans with those published in the literature shows an acceptable agreement, suggesting the validity of the present modeling for mice. In the future, a more sophisticated dosimetric study of inhaled radon progeny in mice would be desirable to demonstrate how anatomical, physiological, and environmental parameters can influence absorbed doses.",Excluded

Method(s): Pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI of 68 ESCC patients (37 responders, 31 nonresponders) were analyzed. A number of 138 radiomic features were extracted from each image sequence respectively. Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to evaluate the capability of each feature on treatment response classification. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the studied features were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were constructed based on the training set (23 responders, 20 nonresponders) for the prediction of treatment response, and then the testing set (14 responders, 11 nonresponders) validated the reliability of the models. Comparison between the performances of the models was performed by using McNemar's test. Result(s): Radiomic analysis showed significance in the prediction of treatment response. The analyses showed that complete responses (CRs) versus stable diseases (SDs), partial responses (PRs) versus SDs, and responders (CRs and PRs) versus nonresponders (SDs) could be differentiated by 26, 17, and 33 features (T2W: 11/11/15, SPAIR T2W: 15/6/18), respectively. The prediction models (ANN and SVM) based on features extracted from SPAIR T2W sequence (SVM: 0.929, ANN: 0.883) showed higher accuracy than those derived from T2W (SVM: 0.893, ANN: 0.861). No statistical difference was observed in the performance of the two classifiers (P=0.999).

1688,"Time-dependence of the effect of X-irradiation on the formation of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenases in the developing rat brain X-irradiation (100-1500 r) administered to the heads of rats 8-30 days of age inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (l-glycerol 3-phosphate-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) in the brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery. It is proposed that the inhibition of enzyme formation is related to radiation damage caused to DNA. Actinomycin D inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in a manner similar to ionizing radiation. Four other dehydrogenases also showed age-dependent radiosensitivities. ;Malic enzyme' (EC 1.1.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) ceased to be radiosensitive at about 8 days of age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.42) at 16 days.

The reference point was contoured that the main portal ven divided in the liver hilum into the left portal vein branch and the right portal vein branch on the contrast enhanced simulation CT scan set. Two different isotropic expansions from the reference point were generated as 2(zone 1) and 4 cm(zon 2). Out of zone 2 was defined as zone 3 in the rest of liver. The radiation doses of each zones were converted BED 10 and tested for correlation with liver functon tests which were obtained during follow up. Liver functions were assessed with Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) grading system for liver disease severity. Result(s): Median follow up was 10 months (range 6-36 months). Four of 76 patients were diagnosed with primary liver tumor(Hepatocellulary ca), rest of 72 patients were diagnosed secondary tumor(kolorectal 30, lung 21, breast 13, other 8). Median age was 64(range 48-76). Sixteen of patients have grade 1 liver disfunction, 4 of patients have grade 2 toxicity after radiotherapy. The prescription doses were 45-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Median tumor volume was 24.4 cc(range 8.5-39.9 cc). The volume of received 20 Gy (VBED1020) more than 50 cc in the zone 2, was significantly correlated with grade 1 toxicity(p=0.03). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the volume of received 20 Gy more than 50 cc dose to 2 cm expansion from reference point in the liver may be associated with acute liver enzyme abnormality. This dosimetric parameter has potential implications for future liver SBRT studies.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3003,"Increased occurrence of exfoliation in the male, Spanish American population of New Mexico Exfoliation syndrome was found to occur much more frequently in the male Spanish American population of New Mexico. This was based on a Veterans Administration Medical Center study in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The prevalence of exfoliation in the Spanish Americans was estimated to be from 3-6 percent and this is consistent with many other such studies performed in the United States and other countries. The Spanish American population is 5.8 times more likely to develop exfoliation than the non-Spanish American population of New Mexico. Exfoliation was found on such eye structures as the lens, iris, ciliary processes, posterior capsule, vitreous face, posterior corneal surface, and arterial chamber angle. Glaucoma capsulare was also studied and it was found that there was not a significant difference between the Spanish American and the non-Spanish American population for developing the condition. However, there was a strong association of glaucoma with the presence of exfoliation in both groups. Based on our results, patients with exfoliation are 22 times more likely to develop glaucoma than are their age-matched controls. Also, 40 percent of the exfoliation patients had glaucoma compared with only 5 percent of the age-matched controls (p less than .001). The patients with glaucoma capsulare were found to have a more medically resistant type of glaucoma, which was consistent with other reports of this condition. There are two theories we propose for the existence of exfoliation in the Spanish American population of New Mexico. The first is a geographic climatic theory that relates exfoliation to greater solar radiation levels due to a high overall altitude and sunny weather in New Mexico.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
1818,"Cancer risk estimation of genotoxic chemicals based on target dose and a multiplicative model A mechanistic model and associated procedures are proposed for cancer risk assessment of genotoxic chemicals. As previously shown for ionizing radiation, a linear multiplicative model was found to be compatible with published experimental data for ethylene oxide, acrylamide, and butadiene. The validity of this model was anticipated in view of the multiplicative interaction of mutation with inherited and acquired growth-promoting conditions. Concurrent analysis led to rejection of an additive model (i.e. the model commonly applied for cancer risk assessment). A reanalysis of data for radiogenic cancer in mouse, dog and man shows that the relative risk coefficient is approximately the same (0.4 to 0.5 percent per rad) for tumours induced in the three species. Doses in vivo, defined as the time- integrated concentrations of ultimate mutagens, expressed in millimol x kg- 1 x h (mMh) are, like radiation doses given in Gy or rad, proportional to frequencies of potentially mutagenic events. The radiation dose equivalents of chemical doses are, calculated by multiplying chemical doses (in mMh) with the relative genotoxic potencies (in rad x mMh-1) determined in vitro. In this way the relative cancer incidence increments in rats and mice exposed to ethylene oxide were shown to be about 0.4 percent per rad-equivalent, in agreement with the data for radiogenic cancer. Our analyses suggest that values of the relative risk coefficients for genotoxic chemicals are independent of species and that relative cancer risks determined in animal tests apply also to humans. If reliable animal test data are not available, cancer risks may be estimated by the relative potency. In both cases exposure dose/target dose relationships, the latter via macromolecule adducts, should be determined.",Excluded
1602,"Radiotherapy for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Purpose: Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNTs) are rare malignant neoplasms considered to be resistant to radiotherapy (RT), although data on efficacy are scarce. We reviewed our institutional experience to further delineate the role of RT for patients with PNTs. Methods and Materials: Between 1986 and 2006, 36 patients with PNTs were treated with RT to 49 sites. Of these 36 patients, 23 had radiographic follow-up data, which were used to determine the tumor response rate and freedom from local progression. Long-term toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Result(s): The overall response rate to RT was 39% (13% complete response, 26% partial response, 56% stable disease, and 4% progressive disease). A significant difference in the freedom from local progression between the groups receiving either greater than or less than the median 2 Gy/fraction biologically equivalent dose of 49.6 Gy was found, with all radiographic progression occurring in patients who had received <=32 Gy. The actuarial 3-year local freedom from progression rate was 49%. Palliation was achieved in 90% of patients, with either improvement or resolution of symptoms after RT. Of 35 patients, 33 had metastatic disease at their referral for RT, and the median overall survival for this patient population was 2 years. Three long-term Grade 3 or greater toxicities were recorded. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective modality for achieving local control in patients with PNTs. RT produces high rates of symptomatic palliation and freedom from local progression. Prospective trials of radiotherapy for PNTs are warranted. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1656,"The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cortical inhibition in healthy human subjects It has been suggested that the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are mediated through changes in cortical inhibition (CI). However, in healthy human subjects the effects of rTMS on CI have been inconsistent. Therefore, this study sought to improve on the methodological limitations of previous studies by exploring several different rTMS-stimulus conditions on inhibition in the human motor cortex. In the first experiment, 12 healthy control subjects were randomly assigned to receive regular 1, 10 or 20 Hz rTMS in a counterbalanced order with sessions separated by at least 1 week. In the second experiment, 10 of these 12 subjects received priming rTMS (600 stimuli at 6 Hz followed by 600 stimuli at 1 Hz). Cortical inhibition was indexed using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Corticospinal excitability was indexed using motor threshold and MEP amplitude. We found no significant overall change in SICI, although there was a significant correlation between changes in SICI with baseline SICI. Subjects with greater SICI at baseline tended to have reduction in SICI post-rTMS, whereas subjects with less SICI tended to have increase in SICI post-rTMS. There was also a significant lengthening of the CSP with higher stimulation frequencies compared to lower stimulation frequencies. These findings suggest that rTMS increases CI, particularly in subjects with reduced baseline inhibition, a finding consistent with the concept of homeostatic plasticity. Baseline physiological characteristics may be further explored as a method to select patients who may benefit from rTMS treatment.",Excluded
750,"Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing AIM: Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients., MATERIALS-METHODS: This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization., RESULTS: Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism., CONCLUSION: We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

645,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

Most of these tissues were radioprotected, and the degree of radioprotection depended on the dose of WR-2721 and the time interval between administration of WR-2721 and radiation treatment. WR-2721 increased resistance of jejunal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells to single doses of gamma-rays by factors of 1.64 and 1.54, respectively. Protection against hair loss was less pronounced; the dose-modifying factor here was 1.24. The radiation-induced acute damage of the lung expressed by the increased formation of tumor nodules in the lung was not decreased by treatment of animals with WR-2721 before radiation. In contrast, WR-2721 augmented the radiation-induced enhancement of metastasis formation in the lung. WR-2721 protected fibrosarcoma micrometastases in the lung against therapeutic effect of radiation by a factor of 1.238. In contrast, this compound had no effect on the therapy of an 8-mm fibrosarcoma growing in the legs of mice.",Excluded
2424,"Clinical experience with a 3D surface patient setup system for alignment of partial-breast irradiation patients Purpose: To assess the utility of surface imaging on patient setup for accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). Methods and Material: A photogrammetry system was used in parallel to APBI setup by laser and portal imaging. Surface data were acquired after laser and port-film setup for 9 patients. Surfaces were analyzed in comparison to a reference surface from the first treatment session by use of rigid transformations. The surface model after laser setup was used in a simulated photogrammetry setup procedure. In addition, breathing data were acquired by surface acquisition at a frame rate of 7 Hz. Result(s): Mean 3D displacement was 7.3 mm (SD, 4.4 mm) and 7.6 mm (SD, 4.2 mm) for laser and port film, respectively. Simulated setup with the photogrammetry system yielded mean displacement of 1 mm (SD, 1.2 mm). Distance analysis resulted in mean distances of 3.7 mm (SD, 4.9 mm), 4.3 mm (SD, 5.6 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD, 2.4 mm) for laser, port film, and photogrammetry, respectively. Breathing motion at isocenter was smaller than 3.7 mm, with a mean of 1.9 mm (SD, 1.1 mm). Conclusion(s): Surface imaging for PBI setup appears promising. Alignment of the 3D breast surface achieved by stereo-photogrammetry shows greater breast topology congruence than when patients are set up by laser or portal imaging. A correlation of breast surface and CTV must be quantitatively established. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
993,"Magnetic resonance enterocolonography is useful for simultaneous evaluation of small and large intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease BACKGROUND: We developed novel magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MREC) for simultaneously evaluating both small and large bowel lesions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MREC by comparing results of this procedure to those of endoscopies for evaluating the small and large bowel lesions of patients with CD., METHODS: Thirty patients with established CD were prospectively examined by newly developed MREC. Patients underwent ileocolonoscopy (ICS) (24 procedures) or double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) (10 procedures) after MREC on the same day. Two gastroenterologists and two radiologists who were blinded to the results of another study evaluated endoscopy and MREC findings, respectively., RESULTS: In colonic lesions the sensitivities of the MREC for deep mucosal lesions (DML), all CD lesions, and stenosis were 88.2, 61.8, and 71.4%, respectively, while the specificities were 98.1, 95.3, and 97.7%, respectively. In small intestinal lesions, MREC sensitivities for DML, all CD lesions, and stenosis were 100, 85.7, and 100%, respectively, while specificities were 100, 90.5, and 93.1%, respectively. Endoscopic scores were significantly correlated with MREC scores. Eleven (46%) of the 24 patients who were clinically not suspected to show stricture were observed to demonstrate stricture by radiologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that MREC can simultaneously detect the CD lesions of the small and large intestine. MREC can be performed without radiation exposure, the use of enema, or the placement of a naso-jejunal catheter. MREC and endoscopy have comparable abilities for evaluating mucosal lesions of patients with CD. Copyright © 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.",Excluded
2958,"Impact of treatment interruptions due to toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy alone We investigated the effect of treatment interruptions due to high-grade (> or =3) toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (Hfx RT). Of 116 patients treated with total tumour doses of 69.6 Gy, 1.2 Gy b.i.d. fractionation, 44 patients refused surgery while 72 patients were medically inoperable due to existing co-morbid states. Patients who were medically inoperable had worse KPS (P=0.0059) and more pronounced weight loss (P=0.0005). Among them, 12 patients experienced high-grade toxicity and 11 of them with either acute (n=6) or ""consequential"" late (n=5) high-grade toxicity requested interruption in the Hfx RT course (range, 12-25 days; median, 17 days). Superior survival (OS) was observed in patients who refused surgery when compared to those who were medically inoperable (P=0.0041), as well as superior local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (P=0.011), but not different distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.14). Cause-specific survival (CSS) also favoured patients who refused surgery (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis showed independent influence of the reason for not undergoing surgery on OS (P=0.035), but not on LRFS (P=0.084) or CSS (P=0.068). Patients who refused surgery did not experience high-grade toxicity (0/44), whereas 11 of 72 patients with medical inoperability and co-morbid states experienced high-grade toxicity and had treatment interruptions to manage toxicity (P=0.0064). Patients without treatment interruptions had significantly better OS (P=0.00000), LRFS (P=0.00000) and CSS (P=0.00000) than those with treatment interruptions. When corrected for treatment interruptions, the reason for not undergoing surgery independently influenced OS (P=0.040), but not LRFS (P=0.092) or CSS (P=0.068). In contrast to this, treatment interruption was independent prognosticator of all three endpoints used (P=0.00031, P=0.0075 and P=0.00033, respectively). When 11 patients with treatment interruptions were excluded, the reason for not undergoing surgery still affected OS (P=0.037) and CSS (P=0.039) but not LRFS (P=0.11). Multivariate analyses using OS, CSS and LRFS showed that the reason for not undergoing surgery affected OS (P=0.0436), but neither CSS (P=0.083) nor LRFS (P=0.080).",Excluded
254,"Long-term outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas at the BC cancer agency Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis. No secondary malignancy occurred during follow-up.

2428,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included
909,"Evaluation of focal thyroid lesions incidentally detected in F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images AIM: Increased uptake in the thyroid gland (TG) is often identified as an incidental finding on whole-body F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the non-thyroid cancer (NTC) patients. Currently, there is no consensus on the appropriate approach for management of these cases. Thyroid ultrasound, scintigraphy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are suggested to exclude malignant thyroid lesions. Our aim is to determine the importance of increased F-18 FDG uptake in TG on PET/CT in patients who are being screened for various NTC and to recommend a diagnostic strategy to identify patients with high risk of thyroid malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 1086 cases undergoing whole-body PET/CT scan between April 2011 and April 2012. Images with incidental focal FDG uptake in TG were identified. Data of the age, sex, type of primary cancer, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), size of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) on F-18 FDG-PET/CT images, and if avalaible, FNAB results were evaluated. RESULT(S): 28 of 1086 patients (2.5%) showed a focal increased F-18 FDG uptake of lesions in TG (14 men, 14 women, mean age+/-SD, 60.29+/-13 years) and the SUVmax value ranged from 1.50 to 18.00 (average SUVmax: 4.19+/-3.41). Thyroid lesions ranged in diameter from 7.0 to 55.0 milimeter (mean+/-SD:16.47+/-11.80mm). The CLN were detected in 11/28 patients (39%). The average SUVmax in CLN was 4.04+/-1.80, the mean CLN diameter was 10.13+/-2.95mm. Twelve of 28 patients (43%) were done FNAB, and the final histopathological diagnosis was malign thyroid nodules in five patient (avarage SUVmax 6.84+/-6.37 and nodule diameter 31.26+/-22.11mm), benign thyroid disease in five patient (avarage SUVmax 3.95+/-1.48 and nodule diameter 9.60+/-2.30mm) and limited and unsufficient materials in two patients. Sixteen patients did not undergo any diagnostic test. CONCLUSION(S): Focal increased FDG uptake in TG incidentally identified on FDG-PET/CT occurred at a frequency of 2.5% and this finding may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy, but the clinical significance is unclear. More data are needed to elucidate the role of SUV in the differentiation of benign and malign thyroid lesions. Clinicians should take into consideration incidentally detected PET/CT findings. Thyroid scintigraphy and, if cold nodule is present, FNAB should be suggested to clinicians for definitive diagnosis.",Excluded
2466,"Reactive oxygen species and DNA damage after ultrasound exposure The aim of this work was to detect the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals after ultrasound (US) exposure and test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species induced by ultrasound can contribute to DNA damage. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed in incubated medium after sonication with 1 MHz continuous ultrasound at the intensities of 0.61-2.44 W/cm2. Free radicals and hydrogen peroxide produced by ultrasound exposure of cells can lead to DNA damage. Comet assay was used to assess the effect of ultrasound on the level of nuclear DNA damage. The nucleated erythrocytes from fish were exposed in vitro to ultrasound at the same intensities and frequency. It was noticed that ultrasound in all used intensities induced DNA damage. The effect was not eliminated by the addition of catalase, which indicates that DNA damage was not caused by hydrogen peroxide only. The results showed that the DNA damage can be repair and this mechanism was the most effective after 30 and 60 min after sonication. Furthermore, the ultrasound-induced DNA damage in the presence of sonosensitizer (Zn- and AlCl-phthalocyanine) was studied. It was noticed that phthalocyaniens (Pcs) alone or with ultrasound did not induce significant changes in the level of DNA damage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

No other predisposing factors for developing BCC were identified, such as immune suppression or a history of other malignancies. Histologic subtypes of all tumors were considered less aggressive, and only one tumor recurred., CONCLUSIONS: Axillary BCC is rare. Factors other than ultraviolet radiation likely contribute to the development of BCC, especially at sun-protected sites.

2027,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included
1440,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded
3272,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included
420,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included
2826,"Positive psychological outcomes of spaceflight: an empirical study INTRODUCTION: Anecdotes from astronauts and cosmonauts suggest that spaceflight can be an enriching experience with enduring positive effects. These positive mental health effects may help protect flight crews from the psychological stress inherent in such high-risk missions. The goal of this study was to identify areas of personal growth likely to result from traveling in space and explore how they were patterned., METHODS: We developed a Positive Effects of Being in Space (PEBS) Questionnaire, which included a section adapted from the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as well as original items addressing experiences unique to spaceflight. We sent the anonymous questionnaire to 175 astronauts and cosmonauts who had flown on at least 1 mission; completed surveys were returned by 39 individuals., RESULTS: Every respondent had a positive reaction to being in space, the strongest of which related to the Earth's beauty and fragility. Respondents reported changes in both attitudes and behaviors. Respondents appeared to cluster into two groups based on the intensity of their reported changes. Response patterns did not vary by demographic group, number of missions flown, or total elapsed time in space., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support the idea that being in space is a meaningful experience that makes an enduring positive impression on astronauts and cosmonauts. An enhanced understanding of the salutogenic effects of space travel will contribute to the education, training, and support of future space crewmembers.",Excluded
1962,"Dysfunctional Lens Index Serves as a Novel Surgery Decision-Maker for Age-Related Nuclear Cataracts Purpose: To study the correlations between subjective and objective cataract metrics with dysfunctional lens index. To investigate the potential of the DLI as a novel surgery decision-maker. Methods: In this prospective, cross-sectional study, we measured the dysfunctional lens index (DLI), Lens Opacities Classification System III nuclear opalescence (LOCS III NO) grading, preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), objective scatter index (OSI) and Scheimpflug-based average lens density (ALD) in eyes with nuclear cataract. Eyes were classified as Surgical and Non-Surgical groups. Correlations among the DLI, OSI, ALD, LOCS III NO grading, and preoperative CDVA were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed for DLI, OSI, and CDVA to determine optimal cut-off values to separate between surgical and non-surgical cataracts. Results: The DLI showed the strongest correlation with the OSI (r= -0.712, P< .001), followed by LOCS III NO score (r= -0.661, P< .001), ALD (r= -0.596, P< .001) and preoperative CDVA (r= 0.563, P< .001). The area under ROC curves (AUCs) of the DLI, OSI and preoperative CDVA curve were 0.972, 0.912 and 0.844 (All P< .001), respectively. The DLI cut-off value of 5.7 implied higher levels of sensitivity (91.67%) and specificity (91.84%) than the OSI cut-off value of 2.9 and the CDVA cut-off value of 0.55 (sensitivity of 89.58% and 71.92%; specificity of 81.63% and 85.71%, respectively). Conclusion: The surgery criterion of DLI <= 5.7 behaved better than the surgery criterions of OSI >= 2.9 and preoperative CDVA <= 0.55 in discrimination between surgical and non-surgical nuclear cataracts.",Excluded
1269,"Treatment and prognosis of stage I follicular lymphoma in the modern era-does PET matter? Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients with stage I disease are usually treated with radiotherapy (RT). In previous studies, mostly from the pre positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) era, the 5 year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of stage I disease were 60-80% and 80-93%, respectively. This study retrospectively evaluated the outcome of stage I FL which was treated with involved field RT in the PET-CT era between 2002 and 2015. Ninety-one patients were enrolled. Five year PFS and OS rates were 73% and 97%, respectively. Relapse occurred in 19 (21%) patients, 74% occurring outside the radiation field. In conclusion, PET-CT staging of clinical stage I FL may contribute to the improved prognosis in patients treated with RT compared to historical cohorts, possibly due to better identification of ""genuine"" stage I disease.Copyright © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
1470,"Gamma knife radiosurgery in the treatment of tumor-related facial pain Background: Intracranial neoplasms can cause pain similar to trigeminal neuralgia. Literature regarding radiosurgery for this is limited. We present a retrospective review of patients with tumor-related facial pain from benign lesions treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at Wake Forest University. Objective(s): The primary objectives were to determine long-term pain relief and predictive factors for pain alleviation. Method(s): We reviewed 515 patients treated with GKRS for benign meningioma, vestibular schwannoma or trigeminal schwannoma between August 1999 and August 2010. Twenty-one eligible patients had tumor-related facial pain prior to GKRS. The median marginal tumor dose was 12 Gy. Long-term pain relief data were obtained by chart review and telephone interview. Result(s): The median follow-up for symptom evaluation was 3.8 years. Seventeen of 21 patients (81%) experienced a Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) score of I-III at 6 months following GKRS. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from BNI IV-V relapse were 66% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years. No pain relapses occurred after 2 years. Conclusion(s): GKRS of benign lesions is a noninvasive option for patients with tumor-related facial pain. Pain relief is modest, with the majority of pain relapses occurring within 2 years and approximately one half of patients maintaining relief beyond 2 years. Copyright © 2012 S.

2382,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC. There is no delay in administration of radiation or chemotherapy, and radiation is completed with minimal toxicity. © 2013 Gurka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1080,"Predictors and clinical significance of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcoma Background. Limb salvage surgery (LSS) has gained widespread acceptance as the current treatment for treating extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and has been greatly refined since its inception. Combined with improved adjuvant treatment modalities, rates of local relapse have greatly decreased. Nonetheless, local recurrence still occurs and identifying the cause and the subsequent effects of local recurrence can provide valuable insights as LSS continues to evolve. Methods. This retrospective study evaluated 278 patients treated for STS of the extremities between 2000 and 2006. Of these, 41 patients developed a local recurrence while 247 did not. Tumor characteristics and prognostic outcomes were analyzed. Wilcoxon rank sum test and either chi or Fisher's exact was used to compare variables. Kaplan Meier and Gray's test for cumulative risk were also performed. Results. Patients who had a positive margin were 3.76 times more likely to develop local recurrence when compared to those with negative margins. This corresponds to a 38% risk of local recurrence if the margins were positive after six years vs. 12% if the margins were negative. In patients who underwent a re-excision, the presence or absence of residual disease upon re-excision did not have any bearing on local recurrence (p =0.27). In comparing patients with and without local recurrence, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate and the proportion encountering distant metastasis and death due to sarcoma (p >0.05). Conclusions. Despite advancements in surgery, radiation and imaging, positive margins still occur, and the presence of positive margins following definitive treatment continues to remain as a strong predictor for local recurrence. While local recurrence represents a negative outcome for a patient, its impact on future prognosis is influenced by a variety of factors such as time to local recurrence as well as the tumor's inherent biological characteristics. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded
1782,"Long-haul flights, edema, and thrombotic events: Prevention with stockings and Pycnogenol supplementation (LONFLIT Registry Study) BACKGROUND: This registry study evaluated the effects of Pycnogenol on edema and thrombotic complications in long-haul flights; jet lag was also evaluated. METHOD(S): Four hundred and fifty subjects at different risk levels for thrombosis, flying in economy class twice in less than a week for more than 8 hours, were included; 295 completed the registry study and were subdivided in 3 groups according to their risk level - low, moderate, or high. The high-risk group also received Aspirin. Astandard management (SM) was used in all groups. In each risk category, three groups were made according to patient management: A Pycnogenol group, a SM group (control), and a stockings group. The groups were comparable at inclusion. No side effects were observed. RESULT(S): In the low risk group edema were reduced more (P<0.05) with Pycnogenol and stockings compared to control. Ankle circumference was smaller with Pycnogenol (P<0.05). No thrombosis was detected. D-dimer was negative in Pycnogenol subjects; one subject in the control group had increased values, as did two of the 36 subjects in the stockings group. In the group with moderate risk, edema and ankle circumference were lower in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). One deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one minimal superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was seen in controls. D-dimer was normal in the Pycnogenol group. In high-risk subjects, edema, and ankle circumference were significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). There were no SVT or DVT in the Pycnogenol group. One minimal DVT and one SVT were observed in controls. D-dimer was negative in all Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05); three post-flight values increased in controls and in four of the 32 subjects in the stockings group. The jet lag score was lower in low-, medium-, and high-risk Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05).

Apart from these qualitative alterations, morphometry of certain parts of microvasculature was performed and some indexes and ratios were calculated. Changes of quantitative parameters were as follows: increase of the capillaries, postcapillaries and venules diameter, increase of their surface and volume, increase of diameter of pericapillary diffusion zone; decrease of the correlation ratio between total arteriolar influx and total venular blood passage within a mesentery segment; decrease of the calculated linear speed of blood in capillaries, postcapillaries and venulas .",Included
2493,"Suppression of experimental corneal angiogenesis by focal X-ray irradiation PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of focal X-ray irradiation on experimental corneal angiogenesis in the rabbit., METHODS: A gelatin hydrogel sheet impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor was implanted into the corneal stroma of rabbits; this induced corneal angiogenesis. After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Focal X-ray irradiation may be beneficial in treating ocular angiogenesis.",Included
649,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included
3201,"Optimization of acquisition time for ultrafast parathyroid SPECT imaging using a solid state CZT camera Objective: To determine the optimal acquisition time for parathyroid SPECT imaging on a dedicated solid state camera (SSC). Method(s): A Discovery 570c SPECT/CT device (GE Healthcare) was used for fast imaging of parathyroid adenomas. Six females and 2 males suspected of having parathyroid adenoma were injected with 740 MBq Tc99m-MIBI and SPECT/CT was performed using a standard camera (Infinia Hawkeye 4, GE Healthcare) for an 18 minute SPECT acquisition time. An additional 5 minute SPECT acquisition was performed on the SSC with the detector orientation modified from the standard <> (for cardiac imaging) to <> to position the thyroid in the field-of-view with the highest sensitivity and resolution. No attenuation correction was applied. To optimize acquisition time, SSC list-mode data were reframed to provide equivalent acquisition times at 15 s and at every 30 s interval up to 5 minutes. For semi-quantitative assessment of image quality, lesion-to-background ratios were calculated for parathyroid adenomas diagnosed on the standard SPECT/CT study. Reconstructed ultrafast SPECT studies with various acquisition times were compared for image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): Diagnosis based on results of the two cameras concurred: 4 patients were positive for parathyroid adenoma, 2 were negative, and 2 were equivocal requiring further confirmation. The average lesion-to-background ratio measured on SSC for the 4 positive parathyroid adenomas increased from 1.3 at a 15 s acquisition time to 2.8 at 3 min and 3.1 at 5 min, compared to 1.9 for the standard SPECT. The incremental increase in average lesion-to-background ratio was <3% for each additional 30 s SSC acquisition time beyond the first 3 min. The visually assessed quality of SSC images showed only moderate incremental improvement for additional acquisition times above 3 min. Conclusion(s): Fast parathyroid SPECT acquisition with the Discovery 570c showed the same diagnostic results as the standard SPECT with similar or superior image quality. Reduction of SSC acquisition time from 5 to 3 min had only a moderate effect on image quality assessed visually and by the semi-quantitative lesion-to-background ratio. The fast acquisition times and the linearity in sensitivity of SSC at clinical count rates support the value of additional studies to determine whether in future the injected dose of the radiopharmaceutical could be significantly reduced for an optimal acquisition without adversely affecting image quality. This may potentially decrease radiation exposure to the patient, improve clinical throughput and provide a partial solution in times of Tc-99m shortage.",Excluded

Method(s):Forty-six patients were recruited and treated on the basis that MRI scanning had shown poor-risk tumours with threatening (1 mm) or involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Conformal RT was given using 3 or 4 fields at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 days per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. Concurrently oral capecitabine was given twice daily throughout radiotherapy continuously from days 1 to 35 and intravenous irinotecan was given once per week during weeks 1 to 4 of RT. Dose levels were gradually escalated as follows. Dose level 1: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 50 mg m 2; Dose level 2: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 3: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 4: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 70 mg m 2. Result(s):Diarrhoea (grade 3, no grade 4) was the main serious acute toxicity with lesser degrees of fatigue, neutropenia, anorexia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The recommended dose for future study was dose level 2 at which 3 of 14 patients (21%) developed grade 3 diarrhoea. Postoperative complications included seven pelvic or wound infections and two anastomotic and two perineal wound dehiscences. There were no deaths in the first 30 days postoperatively.

1977,"Malignant melanoma and other second cutaneous malignancies in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The influence of additional therapy after total skin electron beam radiation BACKGROUND: Previous large studies have shown that patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are at increased risk for basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, and anecdotal case reports have suggested an association with malignant melanoma. It has been postulated that the exposure of cutaneous structures to potentially carcinogenic therapies, such as ionizing radiation or alkylating agents, might be causally associated with the development of these second cutaneous malignancies, but, to date, no study has directly addressed this issue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of second cutaneous malignancies in a group of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with total skin electron beam therapy and to examine the additional effects of oral psoralen with UV-A phototherapy, topical mechlorethamine hydrochloride therapy, and further radiation therapy. One hundred sixty-four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma who had received total skin electron beam therapy between 1974 and 1990 were identified, and information was abstracted from their records., RESULTS: Six patients developed malignant melanoma 12 to 95 months after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the six patients, three had received oral psoralen with UV-A as additional therapy and two had received topical mechlorethamine. None had received additional radiation therapy. Twenty-four patients developed more than 37 basal cell carcinomas and 34 squamous cell carcinomas from 11 months to more than 10 years after total skin electron beam therapy. Of the 24 patients, 15 had received oral psoralen with UV-A and 12 had received mechlorethamine as additional therapy. Additional radiation therapy had been administered to nine patients. During a median follow-up of 6 years, no patients died of any second cutaneous malignancy., CONCLUSION: We found a high rate of both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The additional use of mechlorethamine or oral psoralen plus UV-A, but not radiation, was significantly associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, but not malignant melanoma.",Excluded

Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included
3123,"Determinants of vitamin D status in long-term renal transplant patients In this study, we explored the determinants of vitamin D status in a large cohort of stable, Long-term renal transplant (RTx) patients. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and bone biochemistry parameters, were retrospectively analyzed from 266 RTx patients (>10 yr post-engraftment) presenting to clinic over the course of a year. Forty-five percent of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<37.5 nM), 38% insufficient (37.5 75-nM), and 17% sufficient (>75 nM). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in patients presenting in summer (p<0.001) and in more active patients (p<0.05). RTx patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n=45) had higher 25(OH)D concentrations than patients without NMSC (n=221; p<0.05) despite these patients being older, having worse eGFR, transplanted for longer, and less active physically (p<0.05). Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with higher PTH concentrations (p<0.05) which, in the setting of widespread hypovitaminosis, suggests that secondary hyperparathyroidism was common in this cohort. In conclusion, season and activity status are important determinants of vitamin D status. We report, for the first time, that NMSC is associated with higher 25(OH)D, probably through increased UV radiation exposure. Long-term RTx patients may benefit from oral vitamin D supplementation, but this requires a randomized controlled trial to confirm. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by 40 patients with total or partial edentulous maxillary jaws underwent with 85 dental implants. The ISQ values were measured from these 85 implants at baseline and 3 months after placement. Osttell Mentor device was invented to measure the RF value of the implant fixture through the transducer or pin. Measurements were taken 4 times in each direction of the inserted oral dental implant. OPG X-ray images were also obtained to evaluate the bone and neighbouring anatomical structures. Result(s): The ISQ at baseline had a mean value of 58 (SD 5.91) for all implants placed in anterior and posterior sectors of maxillary ridges. The mean ISQ value on the 3rd month (secondary stability) after placement for all implants was 65 (SD 5.55). An ISQ value >=65 was observed in 65 implants (78.82%) after 3 months of placement. Differences between primary and secondary mean ISQ values were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The one year cumulative success rate was 98.3% for tested and inserted oral implants. Conclusion(s): The results of presented study demonstrates and suggests that the influence and reliability of Osstell ISQ values, measured immediately and 3 months after placement it's predictable for the oral implant outcomes, especially analyzing the sensibility of secondary RFA values.Copyright © 2018, Peytchinski, Gospodin Iliev ET.

477,"Infrastructure of radiotherapy in the Netherlands: Evaluation of prognoses and introduction of a new model for determining the needs Background and purpose: In the Netherlands, the radiotherapy infrastructure is regulated by a Governmental license system. This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. Result(s): The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. Conclusion(s): The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably.

444,"A comparison of thoracic CT and abdominal CT for the identification of thoracic blunt trauma BACKGROUND: In light of current trends to limit radiation exposure and costs, as well as increased traffic safety, computed tomography (CT) may have decreasing value for evaluating patients with blunt trauma. The authors examined the utility of chest x-ray and abdominal CT for identifying clinically significant thoracic blunt trauma., METHODS: In this prospective study, findings on thoracic CT, abdominal CT, and chest x-ray from trauma patients were compared to assess injury prevalence and relevance to treatment outcomes., RESULTS: Four hundred forty-four patients were identified, of whom 76% had no findings. Occult findings had significantly lower Injury Severity Scores. All clinically relevant pneumothoraces and most other injuries could be identified without thoracic CT. Two of 3 aortic abnormalities were suspected from chest x-ray., CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant injuries can be identified with abdominal CT and chest x-ray, safely allowing reductions in radiation exposure, hospital stays, and costs by limiting the use of thoracic CT.

351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded
3195,"Factors governing prepulse inhibition and prepulse facilitation of the acoustic startle response in mice The influence of prepulses on the acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured in three inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J, 129/SvHsd, and AKR/OlaHsd, and one hybrid strain produced by crossing wild mice and NMRI mice. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), i.e. reduction of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the interval between prepulses and startle stimuli was in the range of 37.5-100 ms. Prepulse facilitation (PPF), i.e. increase of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the prepulse preceded the startle stimulus by 12.5 ms. PPI increased with increasing prepulse SPL, PPF first increased then decreased when prepulse SPL was increased. Percent PPI was independent from startle stimulus SPL. All strains showed a long-term increase of PPI when tested for several days; one strain (129) also showed an increase of PPF over days. The present results clearly show that PPI and PPF are independent processes, which add to yield the final response change. PPF and the observed long-term changes of PPI and PPF are stronger expressed in mice than have been observed in rats under similar conditions. Since there were significant differences between the strains of mice with respect to PPI and PPF, genetically different strains of mice are a promising tool to study these two processes.

An Austrian consensus project To define relevant disease parameters and their respective limits indicating the initiation of TNF-alpha-blockers in individual patients. Subsequently, to analyze retrospectively patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS), who started TNF-alpha inhibition in 2006. Points to consider, regarded relevant for individual treatment decisions as well as their assessment methods, were ascertained by experts' consensus applying the Delphi technique. Subsequently, these parameters' thresholds with respect to the initiation of a TNF-alpha-blocker were identified. Thereafter, the rheumatologists representing 12 centres all over Austria agreed to retrospectively analyze their patients started on a TNF-alpha-blocker in 2006. Experts' opinion regarding disease parameters relevant to initiate TNF-alpha-blockers in RA patients only slightly differed from those applied in clinical trials, but the parameters' threshold values were considerably lower. For PsA patients, some differences and for AS patients, considerable differences between experts' opinion and clinical studies appeared, which held also true for decisive parameters' means and thresholds. Six hundred and fifty patients, started on TNF-blockers in 2006, could be analyzed retrospectively, 408 RA patients (53.3 years mean, 340 females), 93 PsA patients (48.9 years mean, 59 males) and 149 AS patients AS (42.2 years mean, 108 males), representing approximately 25% of all Austrian patients initiated on a TNF-blocker in this respective year.

1713,"The maximum tolerated dose of gamma radiation to the optic nerve during gamma knife radiosurgery in an animal study BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

741,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
48,"The relationship between occupational radiation exposure and thyroid nodules Background: Considering that thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer occur more frequently in people chronically exposed to radiation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in staff members occupationally exposed to radiation was determined by ultrasonography. The results were compared with the results of another study among the adult population of Isfahan which selected by cluster random sampling method. The 2 studied groups were matched according to sex and age. Result(s): The case and control groups included 124 and 471 persons, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the case and control groups was 22.6% and 24.6%, respectively (p > 0.05). Although thyroid nodules were significantly more prevalent in females in the control group, no such difference was observed between females and males of the case group (p > 0.05). The number of thyroid nodules (single or multiple) and calcification were not different between the two groups (p > 0.05). In addition, hypoechogenicity of thyroid nodules was not different between the two groups for (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): In our study, there was not any correlation between chronic occupational exposure to low dose of radiation and the risk of developing thyroid nodules. Further studies with larger sample sizes, at different doses of radiation, and considering iodine status and thyroid function are thus required.",Included
672,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded

We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CIRT in patients with external auditory canal (EAC) and middle ear (ME) carcinomas. Method(s): Thirty-one patients treated with CIRT at four Japanese institutions were analyzed. Fourteen patients (45.2%) had squamous cell carcinomas, 13 (41.9%) had adenoid cystic carcinomas, and four (12.9%) had other types. Nineteen (61.3%), six (19.4%), three (9.7%), and three (9.7%) patients had T4, T3, T2, and T1 disease, respectively. All patients had N0M0 status.

127,"Cerebrovascular diseases in nuclear workers first employed at the Mayak PA in 1948-1972 Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) (430-438 ICD-9 codes) have been studied in a cohort of 18,763 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of the workers were exposed to external gamma-rays only while others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation due to incorporated (239)Pu. After adjusting for non-radiation factors, there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence with total absorbed dose from external gamma-rays and total absorbed dose to liver from internal alpha radiation. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.20 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses; the data were consistent with a linear trend in risk with external dose. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-radiation doses to liver from incorporated (239)Pu greater than 0.025 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. There was no statistically significant trend in CVD mortality risk with either external gamma-ray dose or internal alpha-radiation dose to liver. The risk estimates obtained are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Further studies of the unique cohort of Mayak workers chronically exposed to external and internal radiation will allow improving the reliability and validating the radiation safety standards for occupational and public exposure.",Included
96,"Analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

1995,"Abdominal circumference but not the degree of lumbar flexion affects the accuracy of lumbar interspace identification by Tuffier's line palpation method: An observational study Background: Lumbar puncture for spinal or epidural anesthesia is commonly performed by palpating bony landmarks, but identification of the desired intervertebral level is often inaccurate. It is unclear whether such inaccuracy is related to patient factors, such as body mass index and degree of lumbar flexion. We hypothesized that overweight patients and patients with less of an ability to hyperflex their lumbar spines are prone to inaccurate lumbar spinous intervertebral level identification. Method(s): 52 adult volunteers were included in this study. 7 anesthesiologists with different years of experience identified and marked subjects' levels of the iliac crests, then marked the presumed interspaces. Lumbar X-ray was then performed with metal markers, and actual radiographic findings were identified and compared to the initial markings. Result(s): Patients with larger abdominal circumferences (mean (SD), 94.0(12.1) cm), higher body mass indices (25.9(3.9) kg/m), and aged between 50 and 70 years old had lumbar interspaces that were higher than the presumed level; patients with smaller abdominal circumferences (82.8(13.5) cm) and lower body mass indices (21.6(4.1) kg/m) had intervertebral levels that were lower than the presumed level. Cobb's angle, indicating the degree of lumbar flexion, did not affect the accuracy obtained. Conclusion(s): Patients' abdominal circumference, body mass index, and age are factors that may impact the accuracy of lumbar level identification. Tuffier's line, as identified by palpation, does not seem to be a reliable landmark for proper lumbar interspace identification in all cases.Copyright © Lin et al.",Excluded

Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included

2004,"Investigation of sinonasal anatomy via low-dose multidetector CT examination in chronic rhinosinusitis patients with higher risk for perioperative complications The aim of the study was to compare visualisation of the surgically relevant anatomical structures via low- and standard-dose multidetector CT protocol in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and higher risk for perioperative complications (i.e. presence of bronchial asthma, history of sinus surgery and advanced nasal polyposis). 135 adult CRS patients were divided randomly into standard-dose (120 kVp, 100 mAs) or low-dose CT groups (120 kVp, 45 mAs). The detectability of the vital anatomical structures (anterior ethmoid artery, optic nerve, cribriform plate and lamina papyracea) was scored using a five-point scale (from excellent to unacceptable) by a radiologist and sinus surgeon. Polyp sizes were quantified endoscopically according to the Lildholdt's scale (LS). Olfactory function was tested with the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test. On the low-dose CT images, detectability ranged from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic cases to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps. Identification of lamina papyracea on low-dose scans was significantly worse in each group and the same was the case with cribriform plates in patients with advanced polyposis and anosmia. Cribriform plates were the most poorly identified (between poor and average) among all the structures on low-dose images. Identification of anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) with reduced dose was insignificantly worse than with standard-dose examination. The AEA was scored as an average-defined structure and was the second weakest visualised. In conclusion, preoperatively, low-dose protocols may not sufficiently visualise the surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with CRS and bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps (LS > 2) and history of sinus surgery. Low mAs value enables comparable detectability of sinonasal landmarks with standard-dose protocols in patients without analysed risk factors. In the context of planned surgery, the current preferences of the tube should be carefully evaluated for different patient constitutions to minimise the risk of complications.",Excluded

Simultaneously, with the augmentation on each side a microimplant was placed vertically from the top of the alveolar crest penetrating the residual bone and the grafting material. Eight months after initial surgery the microimplants were retrieved with a surrounding bone core. The composition of residual graft material and surrounding bone was analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy., RESULTS: Residual graft material of both types was present as 10-500 mum particles in direct contact with, or completely surrounded by, newly formed bone; smaller particles were also present in non-mineralized tissue. In the case of BCP the bone-graft substitute interface showed evidence of superficial disintegration of particles into individual grains. Median Ca/P ratios (at.%), determined from >200 discreet sites within residual graft particles and adjacent bone, were: DBB: 1.61 (confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.64); BCP: 1.5 (CI 1.45-1.52); DBB-augmented bone: 1.62 (CI 1.59-1.66); BCP-augmented bone: 1.52 (CI 1.47-1.55); P=0.028 for DBB vs. BCP and DBB- vs. BCP-augmented bone. The reduction in Ca/P ratio for BCP over the healing period is consistent with the dissolution of beta-TCP and reprecipitation on the surface of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite., CONCLUSION: The beta-TCP component of BCP may be gradually substituted by calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite over the healing period. This process and superficial degranulation of BCP particles may influence the progress of resorption and healing.",Excluded

Selective enhancement of IgE antibody production by low doses of X-irradiation and by cyclophosphamide Exposure of BALB/c, A/J, and (BALB/c X A/J)F1 mice, which are IgE high responder animals, to total body x-irradiation ranging from 50 to 200 R resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of the hapten-specific IgE antibody level as compared to unirradiated control mice. In contrast, anti-hapten antibody responses of the IgG class in these same animals were rarely enhanced, and when so, were of a lesser degree. This relatively selective augmentation of the IgE vs IgG antibody responses was observed in both unprimed and primed mice. By utilizing adoptive transfer systems, it was demonstrated that the enhancing effects of x-irradiation resulted from its action on the carrier-primed cell population and not upon the responding B cells or upon macrophages. The data presented herein suggest that this enhancement phenomenon is the result of the elimination of T cells (or their products) with suppressive functions and that these cells are neither dependent upon nor specific for the carrier antigen employed in the immunization. This hypothesis is given indirect support by the observations that treatment of the same strains of mice with cyclophosphamide, in doses known to abrogate suppressive T cell functions, resulted in a similar enhancing effect to that observed after low doses of x-irradiation. In addition an interesting difference between IgE and IgG precursor B lymphocytes was observed by the ability of IgE B cells to differentiate to the secretory state at a strikingly more rapid rate than IgG B lymphocytes when exposed to comparable T cell helper influences. These observations may provide important clues to the cellular mechanisms of the immune regulation of the IgE response and its relationship to allergic diseases.",Excluded
2274,"Transanal endoscopic microsurgery for the treatment of rectal cancer: Comparison of wound complication rates with and without neoadjuvant radiation therapy Background: Neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer has led to improved tumor downstaging and higher complete pathologic response rates. At the same time, the introduction of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) technique has renewed interest in local excision of rectal cancer. There has been concern that radiation may make the more radical local excision with TEM unsuitable. Our study compared morbidity rates and wound complication rates for patients undergoing TEM and local excision with and without neoadjuvant radiation to determine whether this could be accomplished safely. Method(s): Data for all patients undergoing TEM are prospectively entered into a database. This database was queried for patients with rectal cancer undergoing TEM from November 1997 to June 2007. Of 64 patients identified, 2 were excluded because of previous radiation to the pelvis. Result(s): The study enrolled 62 patients with a final pathologic diagnosis of rectal cancer: 43 treated using neoadjuvant therapy with radiation (XRT) and 19 patients treated with TEM alone. The patients in the XRT group were 67 years of age (range, 29-86 years) and included 13 women. The patients in the non-XRT group were 66 years of age (range, 40-89 years) and included 8 women. Neither group had any mortalities. The overall morbidity rate was 33% for the XRT group and 5.3% for the non-XRT group, and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The wound complication rates were 25.6% for the XRT group (11 patients) and 0% for the non-XRT group (p = 0.015). Nine patients in the XRT group (82%) had minor wound separations, and two patients (18%) had major wound separation. Ten patients with wound separations were treated as outpatients and administered long-term oral antibiotics. One patient required additional surgery (diverting stoma). Conclusion(s): Not unexpectedly, the wound complication rate was higher in the XRT group. However, 82% of those wounds were minor, and 91% were treated without any additional surgery or intervention. Although a significant concern, wound complications do not prohibit TEM treatment after neoadjuvant treatment. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
2514,"Surgical Risk and Survival Associated With Less Invasive Surgery for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma We compared less invasive surgery with conventional surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with MPM who received surgery at Hyogo College of Medicine between July 2004 and April 2016. Patients underwent multimodal treatment comprising chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) and surgery with or without 54 Gy hemithoracic radiotherapy. Patients were grouped into 3 groups according to the surgery intended: Conventional extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 1 (until August 2009); less invasive extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 2 (after September 2009); pleurectomy/decortication was intended in Group 3 (after September 2012). We included 152 patients (median age 64 [37-71] years; 131 men, 21 women), mostly with epithelioid subtypes (91.4%). Of them, 149 (98.0%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 117 (77.0%) underwent surgery (60 had extrapleural pneumonectomy and 57 had pleurectomy/decortication). Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 94.9% (111/117), and the mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were 1.7% (2/117) and 3.4% (4/117), respectively. The overall median survival time and progression-free survival for all 152 patients were 34.9 and 17.4 months. The overall median survival time for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 18.5, 41.9, and 43.4 months, respectively. The progression-free survival for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 12.0, 24.5, and 21.8 months, respectively. Compared with conventional surgical techniques, less invasive surgery for MPM yielded lower surgical risks and comparable or improved survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
255,"Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis-a rare osteosclerotic bone disorder We present a case of osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OS-CS) in an 18 year old female who presented to our clinic for evaluation of cranial sclerosis (CS). The diagnosis of CS followed work-up for sensorineural hearing loss, which revealed bilateral internal auditory canal stenosis. On presentation, she complained of daily frontal headaches, weekly migraines and right knee pain. Medical history was remarkable for a cleft palate, delayed dental eruptions, hearing loss necessitating hearing aids and irregular menses. She had not sustained any fractures. Family history was negative for bone disorders, neurological disorders or endocrinopathies. Examination revealed a well-nourished female below the mid-parental height who was normocephalic with evidence of a prominent jaw, blue sclera and hypertelorism. Musculoskeletal exam was remarkable for scoliosis and shortened 4th and 5th metacarpals. Neurologic exam was remarkable for myopia and deafness. She had a normal intellect. Work-up revealed normal bone specific alk phos, TRAP, calcium, phosphate, PTH and IGF-1 levels. 24 hr urine calcium studies were normal. Vitamin D level was 21ng/ml. Head CT imaging revealed diffuse osteosclerosis of the calvarium and the skull base with osseous encroachment of the bilateral middle ear cavities. There was hypo-pneumatization of the mastoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. DXA scan showed Z scores of: 4.1 at lumbar spine, 2.0 at left total hip, 4.7 at left femoral neck and -1.5 at 1/3 radius. Thoracic spine X-ray showed mild scoliosis. Radiographs of the femurs revealed vertically orientated sclerotic striations extending from the metaphysis to the diaphysis. Radiographs of the pelvis revealed radiating striations extending into the iliac crests. OS-CS, also known as Horan-Beighton syndrome, is a rare X-linked dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia, characterized by dense linear striations of long bones & pelvis, CS and extra-skeletal anomalies such as congenital heart disease, respiratory & renal tract abnormalities. It is caused by a mutation in the WTX (Wilm Tumor on X chromosome) gene and is often lethal in males (1). Patients may remain asymptomatic or present with complications secondary to CS, namely cranial nerve entrapment. It is important to make a diagnosis of OS-CS to enable appropriate genetic testing and enable further testing for extra-skeletal anomalies.",Excluded

2085,"Postoperative radiotherapy-induced morbidity in rectal cancer OBJECTIVES: We analyzed long-term morbidity and bowel function alteration after postoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer following resection with anastomosis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients who underwent surgery with intention to cure and a minimal follow-up period of 3 years were included. These patients were divided into two groups: in the first group, 14 patients received postoperative chemo-radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid, and 45 Gy plus 5 Gy boost. In the second group, there were 23 patients regarded as controls. We designed a questionnaire about their bowel function and analyzed the morbidity detected in their follow-up., RESULTS: The group that was treated with postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had more daily bowel movements (p = 0.03) and night-time movements (p = 0.04); incontinence (69.2 vs. 17.4% in the control group; p = 0.002), and perianal skin irritation (p = 0.04) versus the control group. Although without meaningful differences, the group under treatment wore a pad more often, had more defecatory urgency, could distinguish worse gas from stool, and needed more frequently antidiarrheal measures. Major complications were present in 28.6% of the under-treatment group: three intestinal resections were performed due to actinic stenosis; one patient had a residual stercoral fistula; another had several occlusive crises solved with medical treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative chemo-radiotherapy had a high morbidity rate, which determined a significant alteration in quality of life. Accuracy in indication is therefore necessary, as well as a consideration of other alternatives for treatment, such as preoperative chemo-radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision.",Excluded
1356,"UCP-3 uncoupling protein confers hypoxia resistance to renal epithelial cells and is upregulated in renal cell carcinoma Tumor cells can adapt to a hostile environment with reduced oxygen supply. The present study aimed to identify mechanisms that confer hypoxia resistance. Partially hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-resistant proximal tubular (PT) cells were selected by exposing PT cultures to repetitive cycles of H/R. Thereafter, H/R-induced changes in mRNA and protein expression, inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSI(m)), formation of superoxide, and cell death were compared between H/R-adapted and control PT cultures. As a result, H/R-adapted PT cells exhibited lower H/R-induced hyperpolarization of DELTAPSI(m) and produced less superoxide than the control cultures. Consequently, H/R triggered DELTAPSI(m) break-down and DNA degradation in a lower percentage of H/R-adapted than control PT cells. Moreover, H/R induced upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) in H/R-adapted PT but not in control cultures. In addition, ionizing radiation killed a lower percentage of H/R-adapted as compared to control cells suggestive of an H/R-radiation cross-resistance developed by the selection procedure. Knockdown of UCP-3 decreased H/R- and radioresitance of the H/R-adapted cells. Finally, UCP-3 protein abundance of PT-derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma and normal renal tissue was compared in human specimens indicating upregulation of UCP-3 during tumor development. Combined, our data suggest functional significance of UCP-3 for H/R resistance.",Excluded
633,"Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester county, Massachusetts A study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure and its radioactive progeny was performed with 200 cases (58% male, 42% female) and 397 controls matched on age and sex, all from the same health maintenance organization. Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included

3119,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included

Method(s): Patients with gastroesophageal (GE) junction (Siewert type II and III) or gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant CRT followed by planned surgical resection at Duke University between 1987 and 2009 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Forty-eight patients were included. Most (73%) had proximal (GE junction, cardia and fundus) tumors. Median radiation therapy dose was 45 Gy. All patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients (75%) underwent surgery. Pathologic complete response and R0 resection rates were 19% and 86%, respectively. Thirty-day surgical mortality was 6%. At 42 months median follow-up, 3-year actuarial OS was 40%. For patients undergoing surgery, 3-year OS, LC and DFS were 50%, 73% and 41%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Preoperative CRT for gastric cancer is well tolerated with acceptable rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. In this patient cohort with primarily advanced disease, OS, LC and DFS rates in resected patients are comparable to similarly staged, adjuvantly treated patients in randomized trials.

387,"18F-sodium fluoride pet bone scans Background Information: 18 F-fluoride is a bone seeking positron emitting tracer with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of osseous lesions, and in particular osteolytic lesions. It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Role of 18 F-NaF PET imaging in detection of malignant and benign osseous disease.

759,"Changes in symptom clusters in patients undergoing radiation therapy GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT.

668,"Stage I-II non-small-cell lung cancer treated using either stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): outcomes of a propensity score-matched analysis BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) are both used for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. We carried out a propensity score-matched analysis to compare locoregional control (LRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: VATS lobectomy data from six hospitals were retrospectively accessed; SABR data were obtained from a single institution database. Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.

2205,"Thoracic spine fracture in the course of severe nocturnal hypoglycemia in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus - The role of low bone mineral density Thus far, only a few spine fracture cases related to severe nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes patients have been reported. Due to the relatively young age of these subjects, osteoporosis was not taken into consideration and bone mineral density was not assessed. We report three type 1 diabetes cases in young patients with durations of 2, 4, and 19 years. These patients had severe hypoglycemic attacks during night sleep with subsequent compression thoracic vertebrae fractures. Laboratory parameters for diabetes control, calcium, phosphate metabolismand celiac-specific antibodies were assessed. Moreover, kidney, thyroid, and parathyroid gland functions were also measured. Bone mineral density was assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Lumbar spine x-ray absorptiometry revealed very low bone mineral density in all three patients. In all subjects, metabolic control was good, no chronic diabetes complications were found and other laboratory parameters were within a normal range. For the first time, itwas demonstrated that lowbone mineral density in young type 1 diabetes patients may contribute to an increased compression fracture risk of the dorsal spine during severe nocturnal hypoglycemia courses. The possibility of osteoporosis in young patients with short diabetes durations suggests it might be advisable to perform bone mineral density testing during diabetes diagnoses. Spinal pain occurrences in young patients after severe nocturnal hypoglycemia should be investigated using procedures for the diagnosis of vertebral compression fracture, even if there is no evident trauma. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded

SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of atypical manifestations in patients with acid reflux disease and the effect of PPI treatment. Patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of reflux were enrolled. Erosive esophagitis was stratified using the Los Angeles classification. Demographic data and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and included typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia), and atypical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, sialorrhea, hoarseness, globus sensation, chronic coughing, episodic bronchospasm, hiccup, eructations, laryngitis, and pharyngitis). Symptoms were reassessed after a 3-month course of b.i.d. PPI therapy. A total of 266 patients with a first diagnosis of GERD (erosive, 166; non-erosive, 100) were entered in the study. Presentation with atypical symptoms was approximately equal in those with erosive GERD and with non-erosive GERD, 72% vs 79% (P = 0.18). None of the study variables showed a significant association with the body mass index. PPI therapy resulted in complete symptom resolution in 69% (162/237) of the participants, 12% (28) had improved symptoms, and 20% (47) had minimal or no improvement. We conclude that atypical symptoms are frequent in patients with GERD. A trial of PPI therapy should be considered prior to referring these patients to specialists.",Excluded
2883,"Partial-brain radiotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma: multi-institutional experience Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been an important component of treatment for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), but delayed neurotoxicity has been a matter of concern. We have employed partial-brain radiotherapy (PBRT) with wide margins for PCNSL patients with a single lesion or a few lesions. In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome in PCNSL patients undergoing PBRT. Between 2003 and 2014, 24 patients were treated with PBRT; 16 received high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) -containing chemotherapy before PBRT. Conventional fractionation with a median dose of 54 Gy was used. For reference, 15 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT were also analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 60% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 68% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy plus PBRT. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 41% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 36% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. The in-field recurrence rate was 26% and the out-of-field recurrence rate was 15% at 3 years for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT. The rates for in-field recurrence and the out-of-field recurrence were 27% and 21%, respectively, for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. CNS-recurrence rates were similar in patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and PBRT to the rates in those undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT. Neurocognitive dysfunction developed in 3 of the 16 patients undergoing MTX + PBRT and in 4 of 15 patients undergoing MTX + WBRT (P = 0.68).

1515,"Diffusion tensor imaging study on radiation-induced brain injury in nasopharyngeal carcinoma during and after radiotherapy AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to monitor the mircostructure change of temporal lobe during the acute and subacute stage of radiation-induced brain injury using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients., METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Eighty patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and treated with the first radiotherapy from July 2010 to May 2012 were enrolled. Routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI were conducted in all patients before and during radiotherapy (radiation dose was 20, 40, and 60 Gy, respectively). The MRI and DTI were also performed in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month after radiotherapy in 47 cases of 80 patients. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI during different stages were dynamically observed and analyzed., RESULTS: The ADC values were increased and the FA values were decreased with the increase of radiation dose (20, 40, and 60 Gy) during the radiotherapy, but there was no significant difference in ADC value or FA value between before and during radiotherapy (p>0.05). Compared with before radiotherapy, the ADC values were significantly increased and the FA values were significantly decreased at the 1st month, 2nd month, and 3rd month after radiotherapy (all p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging reflects the microstructure change of radiation-induced brain injury in the acute and subacute stage, which provides an objective basis for early intervention of potential irreversible brain injury in the late delayed stage, and has important significance for improving the overall efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded
219,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded
2013,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers Background: Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Method(s): Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Result(s): Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 muSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusion(s): [18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
1062,"Environmental radioactivity and high incidence rates of stomach and esophagus cancer in the Van Lake Region: A causal relationship? This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey. Further investigations with long-term detailed environmental radiation measurements are needed regarding the relationship between cancer cases and environmental radioactivity in the city of Van.",Excluded
1371,"A Comparative Evaluation of 3 Different Free-Form Deformable Image Registration and Contour Propagation Methods for Head and Neck MRI: The Case of Parotid Changes During Radiotherapy Purpose: To validate and compare the deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation process for head and neck magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated with radiotherapy using 3 different approaches-the commercial MIM, the open-source Elastix software, and an optimized version of it. Material(s) and Method(s): Twelve patients with head and neck cancer previously treated with radiotherapy were considered. Deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation were evaluated by considering the magnetic resonance images acquired before and after the end of the treatment. Deformable image registration, based on free-form deformation method, and contour propagation available on MIM were compared to Elastix. Two different contour propagation approaches were implemented for Elastix software, a conventional one (DIR_Trx) and an optimized homemade version, based on mesh deformation (DIR_Mesh). The accuracy of these 3 approaches was estimated by comparing propagated to manual contours in terms of average symmetric distance, maximum symmetric distance, Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, and inclusiveness. Result(s): A good agreement was generally found between the manual contours and the propagated ones, without differences among the 3 methods; in few critical cases with complex deformations, DIR_Mesh proved to be more accurate, having the lowest values of average symmetric distance and maximum symmetric distance and the highest value of Dice similarity coefficient, although nonsignificant. The average propagation errors with respect to the reference contours are lower than the voxel diagonal (2 mm), and Dice similarity coefficient is around 0.8 for all 3 methods. Conclusion(s): The 3 free-form deformation approaches were not significantly different in terms of deformable image registration accuracy and can be safely adopted for the registration and parotid contour propagation during radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging. More optimized approaches (as DIR_Mesh) could be preferable for critical deformations.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
1251,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included
522,"Correlation between fracture healing status and euroqol score (EQ-5D) during conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health related quality of life outcome. There are few reports investigating the relationship between fracture healing status and EQ-5D after conservative treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHOD(S): Forty consecutive patients (5 male, 35 female, average age: 78) had fresh VCFs due to primary osteoporosis diagnosed by MRI. They were treated in hospital for 2 to 3 weeks by conservative therapy consisting of medication (NSAIDs, Alendronate, Calcitonin) and brace. EQ-5D and questionnaires were collected at pre-fracture (retrospective) and post-fracture at first visit, at discharge and after 12-week conservative therapy. Radiographic evaluation was conducted by flexion-extension X-ray and CT. Pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed when the intervertebral cleft was seen in both X-ray and CT, and there was a motion more than 3-degrees in flexion-extension X-rays. Correlations among fracture healing status, brace compliance, and EuroQOL score were investigated. Final follow-up rate was 85% (34/40). RESULT(S): There were 30 patients who could move by themselves (Group A), and other 10 patients who could not even turn over due to severe pain (Group B). EQ-5D at pre-fracture, post-fracture, discharge, and after conservative therapy were 0.9067, 0.5030, 0.7538, and 0.7688 in Group A, 0.7359, -0.0179, 0.5546, and 0.7948 in Group B, respectively. Post-fracture EQ-5D in Group B was significantly lower (p<0.0001). Pseudoarthrosis was found in 6 cases (18%), while the intervertebral cleft was observed in 41 at 12-weeks. All these 6 cases answered as the brace compliance, almost all day"". Average EQ-5D in these 6 cases was 0.2657 at first visit and 0.689 after 12-week therapy, which was significantly lower than that of other fracture healed cases(0.8029, p=0.0001). DISCUSSION: Successful fracture healing rate in this conservative therapy was 82%. Eighteen percent of pseudoarthrosis patients with lower EQ-5D could be candidates for the interventional therapy.""",Excluded
2706,"X-irradiation removes endogenous primordial germ cells (PGCs) and increases germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are embryonic precursors of germline cells with potential applications in genetic conservation, transgenic animal production and germline stem cell research. These lines of research would benefit from improved germline transmission of transplanted PGCs in chimeric chickens. We therefore evaluated the effects of pretransplant X-irradiation of recipient embryos on the efficacy of germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Intact chicken eggs were exposed to X-ray doses of 3, 6 and 9 Gy (dose rate = 0.12 Gy/min) after 52 h of incubation. There was no significant difference in hatching rate between the 3-Gy-irradiated group and the nonirradiated control group (40.0 vs. 69.6%), but the hatching rate in the 6-Gy-irradiated group (28.6%) was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). No embryos irradiated with 9 Gy of X-rays survived to hatching. X-irradiation significantly reduced the number of endogenous PGCs in the embryonic gonads at stage 27 in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonirradiated controls. The numbers of endogenous PGCs in the 3-, 6- and 9-Gy-irradiated groups were 21.0, 9.6 and 4.6% of the nonirradiated control numbers, respectively. Sets of 100 donor PGCs were subsequently transferred intravascularly into embryos irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays and nonirradiated control embryos. Genetic cross-test analysis revealed that the germline transmission rate in the 3-Gy-irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (27.5 vs. 5.6%; P<0.05). In conclusion, X-irradiation reduced the number of endogenous PGCs and increased the germline transmission of transferred PGCs in chimeric chickens.",Excluded
3264,"Ultrasonographic Features of the Major Salivary Glands after Radioactive Iodine Ablation in Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic features of the major salivary glands (MSGs) after post-operative radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The study population comprised 202 consecutively registered PTC patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy, RIA and follow-up neck ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic features of the MSGs in each patient were retrospectively evaluated by a single radiologist, and the presence of post-RIA changes was determined by direct comparisons of pre- and post-RIA follow-up ultrasonographic scans. Of the 202 patients, 94 (46.5%) had post-RIA changes in the MSGs on follow-up ultrasonography. RIA dose was closely associated with the prevalence of post-RIA changes. Post-RIA changes were more common in the parotid glands (n = 93, 46.0%) than in the submandibular glands (n = 7, 3.5%). Common ultrasonographic findings representing post-RIA changes in MSGs included coarse echotexture, decreased echogenicity, lobulated margin and decreased gland size.

252,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded
2661,"Influence of cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment on clinical outcome following medial openwedge osteotomy Objectives: High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is an established treatment method for cartilage damage of the medial compartment with concurrent varus deformity. The influence of lateral compartment cartilage lesions on the final clinical outcome remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of those lesions on the functional outcome in patients suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and undergoing a valgus high tibial osteotomy. Method(s): From January 2005 to December 2013, there were 156 patients, suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and an underlying varus deformity, who were treated by a biplane HTO. In all of the cases, a preoperative diagnostic arthroscopy was performed, and the presence of underlying cartilage lesions of the lateral compartment (LC) was assessed and evaluated using the ICRS classification. Preoperatively, the Lysholm score, pain levels (VAS) as well as the presence of pain in the lateral compartment were recorded. Clinical outcome parameters were raised at final follow-up (post-OP: VAS, Lysholm, KOOS, IKDC, WOMAC). Analysis of the pre-and post-operatively recorded X-Rays was performed by means of using a planning software (mediCAD\, Hectec GmbH, Germany), as well as a statistical analysis was carried out with the aid of SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA.) software. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): 37 patients (= 24%) had noticed pain in the LC before the day of surgery. 76. 3% (n = 119, group A) of the patients had no cartilage damage of the LC, 10.3% (n = 16) had a single lesion of the lateral tibial plateau or femoral condyle (group B), 13.4% (n = 21) had corresponding lesions of the LC (group C). Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups concerning mean follow-up, BMI, the Lysholm score or VAS score (p > 0.05). Differences could be found concerning patient age (group A, B > group C; p > 0.001) and preoperative varus deformity (group A < group B,C; p < 0.003). In all patients, HTO was planed aiming for a comparable mild postoperative valgus alignment (p = 0.53). With regard to clinical outcome parameters, group A had the best results reaching statistical significance in the final WOMACpain score (p = 0.032) and WOMACfunction score (p = 0.049). ICRS score of the LC cartilage lesions correlated significantly with WOMACpain and the WOMACfunction. Nonetheless, all of the groups A to C showed a significant increase in the Lysholm score (p< 0.001) and decrease in pain level (VAS score) at final follow up (p < 0.001). Preoperative patient selection prior to the performance of a valgus high tibial osteotomy is of major importance. Presence of cartilage damage of the lateral compartment is adversely influencing final clinical outcome and has to be seen as a relative contraindication for valgus high tibial osteotomy. Nonetheless, even in those patients a significant improvement of functional parameters and decrease of pain levels can be observed.",Excluded
249,"Inter-laboratory consistency and variability in the buccal micronucleus cytome assay depends on biomarker scored and laboratory experience: results from the HUMNxl international inter-laboratory scoring exercise The buccal micronucleus cytome (BMNcyt) assay in uncultured exfoliated epithelial cells from oral mucosa is widely applied in biomonitoring human exposures to genotoxic agents and is also proposed as a suitable test for prescreening and follow-up of precancerous oral lesions. The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

2177,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

3258,"Chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone following induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with stage iii lung cancer Purpose: It is unclear whether adding concurrent chemotherapy (CT) to definitive radiotherapy (RT) following induction CT is a tolerable and cost effective treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged 70 years or older with comorbidities. This study evaluated the actual clinical outcomes between concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and RT alone following induction CT or not in patients (>=70 years) in a single institution's clinical practice. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 82 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Their treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRR), treatment toxicities and distant metastasis (DM) were evaluated. Early mortality rates were also evaluated as 4-month mortality after RT. Result(s): Fifty-four patients received CCRT and 28 patients received RT alone. Induction CT before RT was performed for 68.5% and 50.0% in CCRT and RT alone groups. Treatment tolerance was significantly worse in CCRT (p = 0.046). The median survival was 21.1 and 18.1 months for CCRT and RT alone, which was not statistically significant. LRR and DM were also not different. Most early deaths after CCRT were attributed to non-cancer-related mortality. Acute esophagitis of grade >=2 occurred more following CCRT (p = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of >=5 and a weight loss of >=5% after RT were associated with poor OS. The factors adversely affecting 4-month survival were a CCI of >=5 and CCRT. Conclusion(s): There were no significant differences in OS, LRR, and DM between CCRT and RT alone treatment in elderly patients. However, there was a poorer tolerance and higher incidence of acute esophagitis in the CCRT group. Specifically, when the patients had a CCI of >=5, RT alone seems to be reasonable with a low probability of early death.Copyright © 2019. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded

The positions of the stents in the segmental bronchi were analyzed and compared with the bronchoscopic findings, which were reference standard. Patency versus lack of patency of stents was classified with five levels of confidence, and a definitive diagnosis was assigned to each stent. Prediction of stent dislodgment, follow-up findings, and complications occurring during the observation period were recorded. Consensus reading was performed by two radiologists. Statistical analysis was conducted by receiver operating characteristic analysis or four-field table., RESULTS: Seven patients underwent implantation of 37 stents (mean, 5 +/- 2 [SD] stents per patient; range, 2-8 stents). The area under the curve for differentiating patent from occluded stents was 0.995 with resulting sensitivity and specificity of 86.5% and 98.1%. The correct diagnosis of patency was established with MDCT for all but one stent (sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity for prediction of dislodgment were 80% and 91%. Five stents were not identified during inspection bronchoscopy but were found in a regular position at MDCT. Three instances of minor bleeding and one of pneumothorax resolved spontaneously.

Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation.

Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded
3285,"Effects of radiation therapy on the meibomian glands and dry eye in patients with ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) is the treatment of choice in patients with low-grade ocular adenexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (OAML) and many of them experience post-RT dry eye with varying severity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate ocular effects of RT on meibomian glands and dry eye by directly visualizing structural changes. Secondly, we focused on the comparison of two groups of patients according to tumor location and radiation technique. METHOD(S): Sixty-four eyes with OAML of conjunctiva, orbit, lacrimal gland, or lacrimal sac were grouped into conjunctival lymphoma and ""orbital-type"" lymphoma (i.e., orbit, lacrimal gland, and lacrimal sac). Subjects were investigated for morphological changes in meibomian glands by meiboscore grading system. Radiation technique was examined and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, Schirmer's test, tear film break-up time (TBUT), slit lamp examination of corneal surface and lid margin abnormality were conducted before and after RT. RESULT(S): The increase in meiboscore was statistically significant over time after RT in both groups (P <0.001). The extent of increase in meiboscore was significantly greater in the ""orbital-type"" lymphoma group than in the conjunctival lymphoma group (P <0.001). The changes in OSDI, TBUT, corneal fluorescein staining score and lid margin abnormality score after RT were significantly different across two groups (P =0.042, 0.001, 0.035 and 0.001, respectively). Schirmer's value decreased after RT in both groups. Dry eye symptoms were most severe right after RT in both groups, but a gradual resolution was noted in most patients with conjunctival lymphoma, whereas symptoms persisted in ""orbital-type"" lymphoma patients. The OSDI score and corneal fluorescein staining score were positively correlated with meiboscore in ""orbital-type"" patients at post-RT 6months (r =0.43, P =0.04; r =0.39, P =0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Patients with OAML had different degrees of morphological changes in meibomian glands according to tumor location and radiation technique. ""Orbital-type"" lymphoma patients are more likely to experience severe injury to meibomian glands, which eventually leads to persistent dry eye. Patients with ""orbital-type"" lymphoma should be well informed of post-RT damage on meibomian glands and persistent dry eye.",Excluded
1503,"Clinical experience in 89 consecutive cases of chronic radiation enterocolitis BACKGROUND: Pelvic irradiation has been a popular therapy modality for cervical cancer for many years, and its usage in rectal cancer and prostate cancer cases is on the rise. However, it is associated with significant side effects. In this study, we compared the different characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients who were treated for radiation enterocolitis, the treatment results, posttreatment quality of life (QOL), nutrition status, and predisposing factors for surgery., METHODS: From 1985 to 2009, the records of a total of 89 patients with chronic radiation enterocolitis in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, operative data and long-term treatment results. Posttreatment QOL and nutrition status were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predicting factors associated with surgical intervention. Characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients were compared., RESULTS: Radiotherapy before 1995, concomitant radiation uropathy and smoking were independent predictive factors for surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical cases had similar Kaplan-Meier curves. Although the recurrence rate of radiation enterocolitis was much higher for the surgical group (p = 0.031), both groups had similar QOL score (median: 8 vs.7; p = 0.709), serum albumin level (3.29 g/dL vs. 3.16 g/dL; p = 0.095), and body mass index (20.19 vs. 19.86; p = 0.603)., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that as compared with recently developed innovative techniques, early primitive radiotherapy techniques were associated with more severe radiotherapy complications that required surgery. Smoking may enhance patients' vulnerability to severe radiation injury. Surgery for radiation-induced intestinal obstruction, intestinal fistula and perforation is warranted because QOL, serum albumin level and body mass index were similar between the surgical and nonsurgical groups.

1218,"Radiation therapy in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.",Included

1155,"Diagnostic and prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score of zero: Is it time for guidelines to change? Introduction: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) use has progressively increased as the preferred initial test to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) when clinical likelihood is low. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected by CT is a well-established marker for cardiovascular risk. However, it is not recommended for diagnosis of obstructive CAD. Absence of CAC, defined as an Agatston score of zero, has been associated to good prognosis despite underestimation of non-calcified plaques. Purpose(s): To evaluate whether zero CAC score could help ruling out obstructive CAD in a safely manner. Method(s): Observational study based on a prospective database of patients (pts) referred to cardiac CT between 2017 and 2019. Pts with an Agatston score of zero were selected. Result(s): We included 176 pts with zero CAC score and non-invasive coronary angiography performed. The median duration of follow-up was 23.9 months. Baseline characteristics of the population are shown in Table 1. In 117 pts (66.5%), cardiac CT was indicated as part of their chest pain evaluation. Mean age was 57.2 years old, 68.2% were women and only and 9.4% were active smokers. Normal coronary arteries were found in 173 pts (98.3%). Obstructive CAD, defined as >=50% luminal diameter stenosis of a major vessel, was present in 1/176 (0.6%); while non-obstructive atherosclerotic plaques were found in 2 pts (1.1%). During follow-up, one patient died of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. None either suffered from myocardial infarction or needed coronary revascularization. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, a zero CAC score detected by cardiac CT rules out obstructive coronary artery disease in 98.3%, with only 1.7% of non-calcified atherosclerosis plaques and 0.6% of major adverse events. Although further research on this topic is needed, these results support the fact that non-invasive coronary angiography could be avoided in patients with low clinical likelihood of CAD and zero CAC score, facilitating the management of the increasing demand for coronary CT and reduction of radiation dose.",Excluded
638,"Dose-response study of intracoronary beta-radiation with 32P in balloon- and stent-injured coronary arteries in swine Purpose: A dose-response study was performed in swine to investigate the vascular effects of 32P over a broad range of doses in order to define the therapeutic window of intracoronary radiotherapy (ICR) with 32P. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included

The aim of this study was to report the usefulness of external radiotherapy (RT) for penoscrotal EMPD in an inoperable elderly patient. This report presents the treatment of an 89-year-old man with widespread penoscrotal EMPD. A multidisciplinary treatment team decided on radical RT. The patient received a radiation dose of 61.8 Gy in 30 fractions through electron and photon beams. His treatment tolerance was good, and no severe toxicity had been observed up the last follow-up. At 6.5 years after the RT, the patient showed no evidence of recurrence. Definitive RT resulted in excellent disease control and minimal toxicity; thus, it could be a promising nonsurgical therapeutic option for penoscrotal EMPD, even in extremely elderly individuals.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded

Values of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for peak neon ions compared with 60Co gamma radiation were 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, at the 1% and 10% survival levels. Following irradiation with peak neon ions, the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLD) was comparable to that observed after gamma irradiation. When misonidazole (1 mg/g intraperitoneal dose) was administered in combination with extended-peak neon ions, the drug enhancement ratio (ER) at the 1% survival level was 1.5 if the tumors were removed and plated in vitro immediately following irradiation, and 1.9 if tumor excision and plating were delayed for greater than 6 hours.

In the liver, an area of low attenuation corresponding to the radiation port (or an area of hyperattenuation if the underlying liver tissue shows fatty change) can be seen at computed tomography (CT) performed within 3-6 months after therapy. Later, the liver may be fibrotic and contracted. In the stomach, small intestine, and colon, wall thickening and edema are early manifestations. Ulcers may also be observed. Long-term complications include strictures and fistulas. After irradiation of the kidneys, altered attenuation of the renal parenchyma may be seen at CT. Ureteral strictures, typically involving the distal ureter, may be observed after pelvic irradiation. The bladder may be small and contracted with a thickened wall after radiation exposure. Fistulas between the bladder and other pelvic organs sometimes occur. Typical musculoskeletal changes include growth abnormalities in skeletally immature patients, fatty replacement of bone marrow, and radiation osteitis.

660,"A little to a lot or a lot to a little? An analysis of pneumonitis risk from dose-volume histogram parameters of the lung in patients with lung cancer treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy PURPOSE: To determine whether a little dose to a large normal lung volume or a high dose to a small lung volume is more critical for induction of clinical pneumonitis. The second question is if dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters are more reliable, if the lungs are analyzed as separate organs or as a whole organ., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and DVH data from 49 patients treated for a thoracic malignancy using 3-D conformal treatment plans. 18 patients had developed a clinical pneumonitis (CTC II or III). The majority of patients (n = 48) received radiochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients were generally treated 5 fx/week, single dose 2 Gy, using a two-series approach (shrinking field) up to a total dose of 60-70 Gy. For every individual patient, the overall dose distribution was recalculated in the Helax-TMS by means of adding dose plans according to the total dose applied in each series. The lungs were defined both as separate organs and as a whole organ. Low-dose volume ( 10-40 Gy, Vmod) and high-dose volume (> 40 Gy, Vhigh), as well as V10-V40 and mean lung dose (MLD) were defined from the cumulative DVH. Dose-effect relationships were fitted with a logistic regression model., RESULTS: Manifestation of clinical pneumonitis was within 3 months from termination of irradiation in all cases. For the ipsilateral lung, the incidence of pneumonitis was closely correlated to Vhigh. The pneumonitis rate increased from 13% up to 60%. By contrast, with increasing Vlow the pneumonitis rate dropped to < 10%. A similar but less pronounced effect was seen for the total lung. The lung volumes Vlow, Vmod and Vhigh of the ipsilateral, contralateral and whole lung were significantly correlated to the corresponding MLD. The incidence of pneumonitis increased with increasing MLD for the ipsilateral lung with a D50 of 32 Gy and a gamma 50 of 0.98. For the whole lung, the observed increase was less steep. MLD showed a close correlation to NTCP calculated by the Kutcher model. However, NTCP calculation overestimated the pneumonitis risk for the ipsilateral lung and underestimated the risk for the whole lung due to the steeper gradient. The logistic regression curve for the DVH parameters V10-V40 showed an increase of steepness toward higher doses. From the logistic regression curves, a DVH template indicating critical borders of V10-V40 was generated for the ipsilateral as well as for the total lung., CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that it is reasonable to disperse the dose outside the target volume over large areas in order to reduce the volumes of lung receiving > 40 Gy. Reducing the high-dose volume reduces the pneumonitis rate more than a corresponding reduction in the low-dose regions of the DVH. Landmarks for DVH optimization as defined in this analysis may serve as a basis for DVH contrains in IMRT planning. Separate organ analysis produced more reliable results and should be preferred to whole-organ analysis, if techniques mainly involving one side of the lung are applied. Further validation of these constraints is necessary prior to general recommendation.",Excluded
2988,"Toxoplasma gondii: effect of sublethal irradiation on host resistance in mice The effect of sublethal whole-body irradiation (500 rad) on the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to infection with Toxoplasma gondii was studied. Mice irradiated 1 day before or 4 days after infection via the intraperitoneal or peroral route with cysts of the mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died sooner than did unirradiated controls. The time to death of irradiated mice was suggestive of impaired acquired immunity. Irradiated mice infected intraperitoneally with T. gondii cysts exhibited reduced levels of Thy-1+CD4-CD8- cells, less natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 targets, and lower levels of IFN-gamma than controls. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also lower in infected, irradiated mice. Irradiated mice immunized with a vaccine strain of T. gondii, and later challenged with a highly virulent strain, were less well protected than unirradiated controls. Irradiation appears to impair early, CD4(+)- and CD(8+)-independent resistance to T. gondii, as well as acquisition of immunity.",Excluded
3153,"Identification of circulating tumor cells using 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization: Validation of a noninvasive aid for ruling out lung cancer in patients with low-dose computed tomography-detected lung nodules Background: Approximately one third of needle biopsies that are performed to rule out malignancy of indeterminate pulmonary nodules detected radiologically during lung cancer screening are negative, thus exposing cancer-free patients to risks of pneumothorax, bleeding, and infection. A noninvasive confirmatory tool (eg, liquid biopsy) is urgently needed in the lung cancer diagnosis setting to stratify patients who should receive biopsy versus those who should be monitored. Method(s): A novel antigen-independent, 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based method was developed to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with abnormalities in gene copy numbers in mononuclear cell-enriched peripheral blood samples from patients with (n = 107) and without (n = 100) lung cancer. Result(s): Identification of CTCs using FISH probes at 10q22.3/CEP10 and 3p22.1/3q29 detected lung cancer cases with 94.2% accuracy, 89% sensitivity, and 100% specificity compared with biopsy.

2441,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included
1875,"Independent roles of calcium and voltage-dependent potassium currents in controlling spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons The calcium-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that follows trains of action potentials is responsible for controlling action potential firing patterns in many neuronal cell types. We have previously shown that the slow AHP contributes to spike frequency adaptation in pyramidal neurons in the rat lateral amygdala. In addition, a dendritic voltage-gated potassium current mediated by Kv1.2-containing channels also suppresses action potential firing in these neurons. In this paper we show that this voltage-gated potassium current and the slow AHP act together to control spike frequency adaptation in lateral amygdala pyramidal neurons. The two currents have similar effects on action potential number when firing is evoked either by depolarizing current injections or by synaptic stimulation. However, they differ in their control of firing frequency, with the voltage-gated potassium current but not the slow AHP determining the initial frequency of action potential firing. This dual mechanism of controlling firing patterns is unique to lateral amygdala neurons and is likely to contribute to the very low levels of firing seen in lateral amygdala neurons in vivo.",Excluded
963,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
3432,"Nasal cytological changes as late effects of radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal cancer Background: Radiation therapy is a cornerstone in nasopharyngeal cancer treatment. However, it can induce acute and long-term adverse effects, such as acute mucositis and late submucosal fibrosis. Late toxicities could not only affect submucosa but also mucosal cells, determining long-term cytological changes. Objective(s): Evaluation of delayed nasal cytological alterations in patients who underwent radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): In this case-control study, we analyzed 30 healthy subjects and 30 patients treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy for NPC between 2003 and 2011, with a median follow-up of 59 months. All subjects underwent symptoms anamnestic evaluation (rhinorrea, nasal obstruction), endoscopic fiber optic nasal examination, skin-prick tests, and nasal scraping for cytological exam. Result(s): A higher percentage of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, mucosal hyperemia, and presence of nasopharyngeal secretions at fiber optic endoscopic exam was found in radiated subjects (p < 0.05). Nasal cytology analysis demonstrated a higher percentage of neutrophilic inflammation and squamous cell metaplasia and mucous cell metaplasia in treated patients (p < 0.05). No cytological atypia was seen. No statistically significant correlation between nasal cytological changes and objective findings, patients' age, tobacco smoking, and gastroesophageal reflux has been found in the radiotherapy group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy induces late nasal mucosal changes, which may be related to clinical consequences, such as abundant mucus production and its consequent endonasal stagnation. In the future, detailed knowledge of cytological changes in patients' nasal mucosa could represent a key prerequisite for the choice of effective interventions for late radiation-induced rhinitis.Copyright © 2015, OceanSide Publications, Inc., U.S.A.",Excluded
456,"Effective surgical adjuvant therapy for high-risk rectal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy as an adjunct to surgery for rectal cancer has been shown to reduce local recurrence but has not improved survival. In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy. We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone., METHODS: Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent). Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent). In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent). Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects were seldom severe. Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone.",Excluded
