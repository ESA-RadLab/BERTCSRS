2997,"CT-guided iodine-125 seed permanent implantation for recurrent head and neck cancers Background: To investigate the feasibility, and safety of 125I seed permanent implantation for recurrent head and neck carcinoma under CT-guidance. Result(s): A retrospective study on 14 patients with recurrent head and neck cancers undergone 125I seed implantation with different seed activities. The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds ranged from 90 to 218 Gy (median, 157.5 Gy). The follow-up was 3 to 60 months (median, 13 months). The median local control was 18 months (95% CI, 6.1-29.9 months), and the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5- year local controls were 52%, 39%, 39%, and 39%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, 3-, and 5- survival rates were 65%, 39%, 39% and 39%, respectively, with a median survival time of 20 months (95% CI, 8.7-31.3 months). Of all patients, 28.6% (4/14) died of local recurrence, 7.1% (1/14) died of metastases, one patient died of hepatocirrhosis, and 8 patients are still alive to the date of data analysis. Conclusion(s): CT-guided 125I seed implantation is feasible and safe as a salvage or palliative treatment for patients with recurrent head and neck cancers. © 2010 Jiang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1281,"Radiographic changes of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis that persisted into adulthood Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a rare non-infectious autoinflammatory disorder typically seen in young women. We describe the case of a young man who presented at 13 years of age with pain in the tibia, humerus, clavicle and hip. Worsening of the condition through clinical presentation and radiographic imaging was observed over 10 years. Radiographic imaging initially showed some sclerotic changes, but worsened to osteolytic lesions of the proximal tibia, elevation of the lateral cortex and thickening of the anterior cortex. Bone biopsy of his right anterior proximal tibia showed no infection or neoplasia. But, laboratory results showed elevation of inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. The patient was diagnosed with CRMO and treated with antibiotics for suspicion of chronic bacterial osteomyelitis. Chronic bone pain, abnormal imaging and elevation of inflammatory markers suggesting that chronic bacterial osteomyelitis can lead to difficulties with the diagnosis of CRMO.Copyright © BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2020.

1377,"A Comparative Evaluation of 3 Different Free-Form Deformable Image Registration and Contour Propagation Methods for Head and Neck MRI: The Case of Parotid Changes During Radiotherapy Purpose: To validate and compare the deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation process for head and neck magnetic resonance imaging in patients treated with radiotherapy using 3 different approaches-the commercial MIM, the open-source Elastix software, and an optimized version of it. Material(s) and Method(s): Twelve patients with head and neck cancer previously treated with radiotherapy were considered. Deformable image registration and parotid contour propagation were evaluated by considering the magnetic resonance images acquired before and after the end of the treatment. Deformable image registration, based on free-form deformation method, and contour propagation available on MIM were compared to Elastix. Two different contour propagation approaches were implemented for Elastix software, a conventional one (DIR_Trx) and an optimized homemade version, based on mesh deformation (DIR_Mesh). The accuracy of these 3 approaches was estimated by comparing propagated to manual contours in terms of average symmetric distance, maximum symmetric distance, Dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity, and inclusiveness. Result(s): A good agreement was generally found between the manual contours and the propagated ones, without differences among the 3 methods; in few critical cases with complex deformations, DIR_Mesh proved to be more accurate, having the lowest values of average symmetric distance and maximum symmetric distance and the highest value of Dice similarity coefficient, although nonsignificant. The average propagation errors with respect to the reference contours are lower than the voxel diagonal (2 mm), and Dice similarity coefficient is around 0.8 for all 3 methods. Conclusion(s): The 3 free-form deformation approaches were not significantly different in terms of deformable image registration accuracy and can be safely adopted for the registration and parotid contour propagation during radiotherapy on magnetic resonance imaging. More optimized approaches (as DIR_Mesh) could be preferable for critical deformations.Copyright © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Excluded
2112,"Nucleoid sedimentation analysis of DNA superstructure, gamma-radiation-induced damage and repair in human and chacma baboon (Papia ursinus) peripheral lymphocytes The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes. The effects of sedimentation conditions and advantages of using vertical-tube rotors in the nucleoid sedimentation technique are also discussed.",Included
2241,"'Plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer using helical tomotherapy Background and purpose: This study assessed the potential of tomotherapy based Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) to increase the accuracy of bladder irradiation using a 'plan of the day' adaptive radiotherapy (ART) technique. Material(s) and Method(s): Ten patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer underwent bladder preservation with trimodality therapy in an ongoing trial. All patients received 64 Gy/32# to the whole bladder and seven of them received a boost of 68 Gy/32# to the tumour bed. The ART technique entailed the generation of six IMRT plans for each patient, using six isotropic PTVs of 5-30 mm applied to the bladder volume (CTV) to generate the PTVs. Megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging was done to correct positioning errors and choose the 'plan of the day'. Result(s): Post treatment MVCT scans (315 scans) were used to generate multiple anisotropic PTVs for three hypothetical scenarios. Overall, coverage of anterior and superior walls required larger margins than other walls. Maximum geographical miss, in spite of IGRT, was noted for the superior (13.8%) and anterior walls (10.3%). Conclusion(s): Plan of the day ART is a feasible and promising technique for optimal treatment and dose escalation in bladder cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd All rights reserved.

1275,"Reduced ultraviolet-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in human skin with topical application of a photolyase-containing DNA repair enzyme cream: Clues to skin cancer prevention The exposure of human skin to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) results in the formation of DNA photolesions that give rise to photoaging, mutations, cell death and the onset of carcinogenic events. Photolyase (EC 4.1.99.3) is a DNA repair enzyme that reverses damage caused by exposure to UVR. We sought to investigate whether addition of photolyase enhances the protection provided by a traditional sunscreen (SS), by reducing the in vivo formation of cyclobutane-type pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and UVR-induced apoptosis in human skin. Ten volunteers (Fitzpatrick skin type II) were exposed to solar-simulated (ss) UVR at a three times minimal erythema dose for 4 consecutive days. Thirty minutes prior to each exposure, the test materials [vehicle, SS (sun protection factor 50) alone, and SS plus photolyase from Anacystis nidulans] were applied topically to three different sites. One additional site was left untreated and one received ssUVR only. Biopsy specimens were taken 72 h after the last irradiation. The amount of CPDs and the extent of apoptosis were measured by ELISA. Photolyase plus SS was superior to SS alone in reducing both the formation of CPDs and apoptotic cell death (both P<0.001). In conclusion, the addition of photolyase to a traditional SS contributes significantly to the prevention of UVR-induced DNA damage and apoptosis when applied topically to human skin.",Excluded
3048,"Protected and unprotected radiation exposure to the eye lens of vascular surgeons during endovascular procedures in hybrid operating rooms Objective: Radiation induced cataract has been observed at lower threshold doses than expected. Therefore, the annual limit for equivalent dose to the eye lens has been reduced from 150 to 20 muSv. We aimed to evaluate radiation exposure to the eye lens of vascular surgeons working in a hybrid operating room before and after a dose reduction program was established. Method(s): Prospective non-randomized trial with a historic control group. From April-October 2019, radiation exposure to the operator was measured during all endovascular procedures performed in the hybrid operating room using BeOSL Hp(3) eye lens dosimeters placed outside the 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses on the side of the radiation source and behind the lead glasses. Measured values were compared to data from a prospective study performed at the same center in the years of 2012 and 2013 before a dose reduction program had been implemented. Result(s): A total of 181 consecutive patients underwent an endovascular procedure in the hybrid operating room. The mean unprotected eye lens dose of the main operator was 0.119 muSv for EVAR (n=30), 0.118 muSv for TEVAR (n=23), 0.312 muSv for more complex aortic procedures (F/BrEVAR; n=15) and 0.046 muSv for peripheral interventions. Compared to the control period, EVAR had 75% lower, TEVAR 79% lower and more complex aortic procedures 55% lower radiation exposure unprotected eye lens of the operator. The 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses led to a median reduction of the exposure to the eye lens by the factor 3.43. Behind the lead glasses at the level of the eye lens, radiation exposure exceeding the detection limit of 0.042 muSv was measured only in 22 of 181 cases. There was a significant correlation between DAP between both protected and unprotected eye lens dose (p<0.0001, r2 = 0.512 and 0.282). DAP correlated significantly with patients' body mass index, operating time, fluoroscopy time and digital subtraction angiography time. Conclusion(s): The dose reduction program at our institution has led to a relevant reduction of the radiation dose to the head and the eye lens of the main operator in endovascular procedures. With optimum radiation protection measures including a ceiling-mounted shield and 0.75mm lead equivalent glasses, more than 440 EVARs, 280 TEVARs or 128 FEVARs could be performed per year until the dose limit for the eye lens of 20 muSv would be reached.",Excluded
1686,"Radiological evolution of coral substitute implanted into lower limb cancellous bone madreporic coral versus coralline hydroxyapatite Purpose: The study aimed to compare two successive series of procedure using first pieces of natural madreporic coral, then coralline hydroxyapatite in traumatology. The goal of this work was to evaluate long term radiological features of absorption and influencing factors. Material: Within six years, 65 pieces were used; only impaction articular fracture on the lateral tibial plateau (31) and calcaneum fractures (23) were included 21 cases completed inclusion criteria. As there were 3 secondary infections, 18 had therefore, an aseptic evolution and were included in this series. Method(s): Absorption was evaluated in five degrees according to the volume of the remaining piece on X-rays. We also took into consideration the position of the pieces and the amount of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone. Result(s): Among the 18 pieces followed up for more than 19 months (average 40), there were 4 sequestrations (1 tibia, 3 calcaneum), all were natural madreporic coral, the others presented osteointegration. Only natural madreporic coral pieces were absorbed, but never completely and the absorption was slow (3 to 7 years) and never complete. A radiolucent line was present in 7 out of 10 pieces of madreporic coral and none around coralline hydroxyapatite. Three developed favorably. Four were sequestered. Number of surfaces in contact with cancellous bone was correlated with osteointegration. Discussion(s): The calcium carbonate which makes up the natural madreporic coral pieces is the Site of destruction by osteoclasts. The radiolucent line is the specific witness of this biochemical activity. The radiolucent line preceeds sequestrations. No substitute of coralline hydroxyapatite has presented the same sign of peripheral absorption or sequestration. Coralline hydroxyapatite could be the correct coralline material to fill cancellous defect after elevation of an articular depression. In every case, the piece of coral must be fitted in contact with the cancellous bone in the depth of the bone. Conditions of osteoconduction of madreporic coral must be reconsidered. The degree and speed of peripheral absorption must be controlled before weight bearing is allowed.",Excluded
234,"Comparison of 51chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and iohexol as blood markers for intestinal permeability testing in Beagle dogs (51)Chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) is the gold standard probe for assessing intestinal permeability (IP) in dogs, but exposure to radioactivity is a disadvantage. Iohexol is a safe contrast medium commonly used for medical imaging purposes and has been successfully applied more recently for the assessment of IP in animal models and humans. This study aimed at comparing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol as IP blood markers in dogs. A test solution containing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol was administered intragastrically to seven healthy laboratory Beagle dogs, and percentage recoveries in serum were calculated. The strong linear association (correlation, r=0.76 and linear regression, y=0.03+5.04x) between (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol supports the potential usefulness of iohexol as an IP blood marker in dogs.

1614,"Effectiveness of First-Line Bevacizumab in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: The Observational Cohort Study GRETA Background: Scant real-world data exist on the clinical outcomes associated with the use of bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy (B+CT) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The primary objective of the GRETA cohort study was to compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with mCRC treated with first-line B+CT versus chemotherapy (CT) alone, in an Italian clinical practice setting. Material(s) and Method(s): Incident patients with mCRC were identified during the period 2010-2012 from five population-based cancer registries in Italy. Cases were linked to regional health care utilization databases to obtain the entire spectrum of health services provided to each patient. Patients starting a first-line treatment with B+CT or CT alone within 90 days from the diagnosis were included in the study cohort. A propensity score (PS) method was applied to account for residual confounding. Result(s): Of 480 patients with mCRC included in the study cohort, 21.0 received first-line B+CT, and 79.0% received CT. Patients receiving B+CT were younger (p <.001) and underwent surgery more frequently (p =.001). The median OS was 22.5 and 14.6 months for B+CT and CT, respectively (p =.011). The corresponding hazard ratios adjusted by multivariate modeling and PS matched analysis were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.08) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.56-1.33), respectively. Similar results were observed after subgrouping by age and surgery. Conclusion(s): In this Italian real-world setting of unselected mCRC, the OS of patients treated with B+CT was consistent with previous observational and patient-registry studies. However, definitive evidence of an improvement in OS cannot be drawn. Implications for Practice: Bevacizumab is a well-established first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. However, there is scarce evidence in the literature about its effectiveness in clinical practice. Evaluating this topic should be of interest for both clinicians and regulatory agencies. In this study, the median overall survival of the bevacizumab cohort was strikingly coherent with that reported in large observational series of unselected patients, thus suggesting a consistent and reproducible effect of the drug in clinical practice. Although consistent results were observed both in the overall population and in age and surgery subgroups, the present study did not offer definitive evidence of an improvement in OS.Copyright © AlphaMed Press 2018",Excluded
3042,"Use of neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation and diffusion tensor imaging to avoid motor cortex complications in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy planning Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this preliminary study was to find out if motor cortex and the motor tract can be avoided in robotic stereotactic radiation therapy/radiosurgery (RT/SRS) planning by using individually made maps from these areas. Materials/Methods: Before radiation therapy planning, the motor cortex was mapped from 2 meningioma patients using neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) combined with a neuronavigation system. In addition, the descending motor pathways were determined with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography. Planning CT and MRI scans were also taken. Images were registered in treatment planning software by using a mutual image information algorithm and, in the case of nTMS, map manual registration via external markers. Two RT plans were made both with and without using the motor cortex and descending motor pathways as organs at risk (OARs). Dosimetric analysis was conducted comparing these plans with a focus on target coverage and motor cortex sparing. Result(s): Individual anatomical information from the motor cortex and motor pathways were imported into the RT planning system. Dosimetric analysis is described in Table 1. (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): For the 2 patients, the motor cortex and descending motor pathways were mapped before robotic stereotactic RT for meningioma. These are both noninvasive procedures and easy for the patients. The new OARs were able to be spared without compromising target irradiation. Sparing of the motor cortex and descending motor pathways was noticeable in their 0.01 mL maximum doses, being respectively 11.4% and 6.3% for patient 1 and 54.4% and 16.1% for patient 2. There were no differences in mean values, due the large volume of these OAR structures and the high dose gradients of the robotic stereotactic RT. Target coverage and mean dose were not affected by sparing of the motor cortex with either patient. With using this individual functional information to avoid motor cortex areas in RT planning we were able to spare selected patients from possible adverse effects without compromising target dose coverage. As the study is in a preliminary stage, in the future, motor area information will be mapped from more intracranial RT patients, and this information will be used to spare the motor area better than has thus far been possible. The potential RT-induced aftereffects will be studied during a follow-up period.",Excluded
705,"Assessment of radiation-induced liver injury with computed tomography OBJECTIVE: To review the appearance of radiation-induced liver injury on computer tomography for quantitative assessment of dosimetric changes in different radiological reactions and the influence of time-effect. METHOD(S): The focal liver reactions of 35 patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) for liver malignancies were evaluated, with the applied doses of 36-65 Gy in 4-28 fractions completed in 8-41 days. All patients received nonenhanced CT scan and arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scan 1-6 months after therapy. The liver tissue density in irradiated and nonirradiated liver was compared, and the reaction type and the threshold dose determined radiologically. RESULT(S): On at least one follow-up examination, 51.4% of patients were found to have a focal radiation reaction in the liver. The radiation reaction was hypodense in 43.75% of the follow-up nonenhanced CT examinations and in 19.23% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. It was hyperdense in 42.31% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. The median threshold dose inducing a radiation reaction was 30.8 Gy (range 18-42.8 Gy). The detected threshold dose was positively correlated with the time of detection of the reaction (P=0.041), with a correlation coefficient of -0.473. On arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans, the threshold dose was significantly higher for hyperdense than for hypodense changes (P=0.017). In additional follow-up, the reaction volume decreased and the reaction types changed on arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. CONCLUSION(S): The threshold dose can be different in different radiological reaction types on multiphase CT scans. The detected threshold dose is inversely correlated with the time of detection of the early reaction. Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT is helpful to distinguish radiation reactions from recurrent tumors.",Excluded
213,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
1516,"Neuropsychological function in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy A neuropsychological test battery was administered to 27 adult patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who had received radiotherapy, 28 adult patients with NPC awaiting radiotherapy, and 35 normal adult controls. The 27 patients with radiotherapy had a conventional dosage, 220 cGy per fraction, or less. The median interval between the completion of radiotherapy and the evaluation of neuropsychological function was 1.7 years. Groups were matched for age and educational level. The results showed that our NPC group with radiotherapy had neuropsychological impairments in the areas of auditory attention/concentration, immediate and delayed verbal recall and immediate visual recall, and recent memory, higher-order visuospatial abilities, and bimanual dexterity. Thus neuropsychological dysfunction may occur in patients with NPC within the first 2 years after radiotherapy.",Included
2169,"Radiation exposure of extracranial organs at risk during stereotactic linac radiosurgery BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stereotactic radiosurgery of intracranial tumors and vascular malformations can be performed by either a linear accelerator (Linac) or gamma knife. The aim of this first study on patients was to determine the radiation exposure of organs at risk and assess the risk for late effects including secondary tumors and/or hereditary disorders after stereotactic Linac radiosurgery., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thermoluminescent dosimetry (TLD) measurements were done on 21 consecutively admitted patients with various intracranial lesions scheduled for Linac radiosurgery. The TLD chips were placed on the eyelid, thyroid, breast and the regions of the ovary or testes., RESULTS: The mean doses in organs at risk were 276 +/- 200 mGy (eye lens), 155 +/- 83 mGy (thyroid), 47 +/- 22 mGy (breast), 20 +/- 12 mGy (ovary), and 9 +/- 3 mGy (testes). The doses decreased significantly with a larger distance from the isocenter., CONCLUSION: The absorbed doses to the extracranial organs at risk in patients undergoing Linac radiosurgery were very low, ranging from 0.025% (testes) to 0.76% (eye lens) of the mean maximum target dose (36 Gy). Nevertheless, while the majority of radiosurgery patients have benign tumors or arteriovenous malformations and their life expectancy is long, all doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable. This could be accomplished by the use of modern irradiation techniques including conformal beams with micro-multileaf collimator and avoiding beams directed to the trunk.",Excluded
2835,"Hearing Assessment after Treatment of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma with CRT and IMRT Techniques OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the long-term hearing loss after treatment of primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma to elucidate its causal factors., METHODS: Ninety-two nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients were treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Pure tone audiometry was performed before the therapy and annually up to 9 years after completing treatment. The hearing thresholds were corrected for age-related deterioration and compared to the results without adjusting for age., RESULTS: The mean air and bone conduction threshold with and without correction for age-related deterioration differed significantly 2-9 years after completing radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The audiometry results with age correction showed a flattened configuration compared to the results without age correction. The total radiation dose and radiation modality showed a causal relationship with a greater incidence of hearing loss after therapy (p < 0.05). There was more deterioration in the air and bone hearing thresholds with conformal radiotherapy than intensity-modulated radiotherapy (p < 0.001). A radiation dose >72 cGy resulted in more severe hearing loss than <72 cGy (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Hearing loss after completing therapy should be corrected for age-related hearing deterioration to reveal the true extent to which the loss is a therapeutic complication. Both the radiation modality used and the dose were significantly associated with hearing loss.",Excluded
696,"A noninvasive objective measure of sunscreen use and reapplication OBJECTIVES: To study whether a noninvasive swabbing technique can detect sunscreen use for up to 6 hours, and whether the technique can detect reapplication of sunscreen., METHODS: Thirty volunteer office workers were randomly assigned to have one of a variety of sunscreens applied using recommended application techniques, and half were randomly assigned to have sunscreen reapplied after 3 hours. Alcohol-based swabs were used to obtain a sample from participants' arm at 20 minutes, and hourly from 1 to 6 hours post-application.

The absorption readings between 20 minutes and 6 hours were significantly higher than control swabs. There were no differences between the group that had sunscreen reapplied and the group that did not., CONCLUSION: The sunscreen swabbing technique is an effective noninvasive method for detecting a variety of sunscreen products in adults over a 6-hour period. No differences in absorption readings were found with sunscreen reapplication. This procedure will be a useful adjunct to other objective measures of sun protection and UV radiation exposure, resulting in a more accurate picture of the sun protection habits of individuals.",Excluded

3249,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy for high-risk head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the use of postoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy, with either weekly cisplatin or carboplatin, for high-risk head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a single institutional setting., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between July 1999 and January 2003, 47 patients were treated with postoperative chemoradiotherapy., RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 41 (87%) had Stage III-IV disease. The predominant primary site was the oral cavity in 24 patients (51%), 27 had nodal disease with extracapsular extension, and 26 had positive or close mucosal margins (<5 mm). Ten patients had undergone resection of recurrent disease after previous surgery. Twenty-seven (57%) were treated with cisplatin, and the remaining patients received carboplatin because of contraindications to cisplatin. The median radiotherapy dose was 60 Gy (range, 50-66 Gy). Of the 47 patients, 45 (96%) completed at least four of the six planned doses of chemotherapy and 45 (96%) completed the planned course of radiotherapy. Nineteen patients (40%) had confluent mucositis, eight (17%) had Grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity, and four (9%) had febrile neutropenia. No treatment-related deaths occurred. The estimated 2-year locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate was 73%, 56%, and 62%, respectively. Excluding the 10 patients with recurrence after previous surgery, the locoregional control, progression-free survival, and overall survival rate was 81%, 64%, and 71%, respectively. Five cases of Grade 3-4 late treatment-related sequelae developed., CONCLUSION: Treatment with postoperative concurrent weekly cisplatin or carboplatin and radiotherapy was reasonably well tolerated. Acute and late toxicity was acceptable. The overall results achieved are comparable with the preliminary results of recent randomized trials. Patients treated after resection of recurrent disease (after previous surgery alone) fared worse than those treated at the initial resection.",Excluded
324,"Feasibility and acute efficacy of radiofrequency ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter guided by real-time 3D TEE Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acute efficacy of real-time 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT3DTEE)guided ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CVTI). Background(s): The use of RT3DTEE to guide a transcatheter radiofrequency ablation procedure has never been systematically investigated. Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with CVTI-dependent atrial flutter underwent CVTI ablation. Procedural monitoring using RT3DTEE was assigned to patients who requested general anesthesia for the procedure (n = 21 [30%]). In the other 49 patients (the control group), the procedures were monitored using the standard fluoroscopic approach. Procedural time was considered as skin-to-skin electrophysiological procedure duration, not including anesthesia preparation; adequate radiofrequency ablation applications (with fixed temperature and power settings) were considered as lesions lasting < 60 s. Result(s): RT3DTEE allowed visualization of the CVTI and identified related structures in most patients (20 of 21); anatomic features such as long CVTI (n = 11), prominent Eustachian ridge (n = 9), prominent Eustachian valve (n = 6), septal recess (n = 8), and pectinate muscles (n = 10) were frequent. Also, RT3DTEE allowed continuous visualization of ablation catheter movement and contact. Compared with the control group, RT3DTEE was equally effective in achieving CVTI bidirectional block (100% in both groups), and no complications occurred. RT3DTEE shortened procedural time (median 73.0 min, interquartile range [IQR] 60.0 to 90.0 min, vs. median 115.0 min, IQR 85.0 to 133.0 min, p < 0.001), reduced radiation exposure (median fluoroscopy time 4.2 min, IQR 3.1 to 8.4 min, vs. median 19.3 min, IQR 12.9 to 36.4 min, p < 0.001; median fluoroscopy dose 575.4 cGy . cm2, IQR 428.5 to 1,299.4 cGy . cm2, vs. median 3,520.7 cGy . cm2, IQR 1,700.0 to 6,709.0 cGy . cm2, p < 0.001), and reduced the number of radiofrequency applications to achieve bidirectional block (median 7, IQR 6 to 10, vs. median 12, IQR 10 to 22, p = 0.007). A strong learning curve was detected by comparing procedural data between the first and last patients treated using RT3DTEE. Conclusion(s): RT3DTEE-guided ablation of CVTI was feasible, allowing real-time detailed morphological CVTI characterization as well as continuous visualization of the ablation catheter during radiofrequency ablation. This approach entailed marked reductions in procedural time, radiation exposure, and the number of radiofrequency applications. © 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
1539,"Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound as a Radiation-Free Alternative to Fluoroscopic Nephrostogram for Evaluating Ureteral Patency PURPOSE: We compared contrast enhanced ultrasound and fluoroscopic nephrostography in the evaluation of ureteral patency following percutaneous nephrolithotomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort, noninferiority study was performed after obtaining institutional review board approval. We enrolled eligible patients with kidney and proximal ureteral stones who underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy at our center. On postoperative day 1 patients received contrast enhanced ultrasound and fluoroscopic nephrostogram within 2 hours of each other to evaluate ureteral patency, which was the primary outcome of this study., RESULTS: A total of 92 pairs of imaging studies were performed in 82 patients during the study period. Five study pairs were excluded due to technical errors that prevented imaging interpretation. Females slightly predominated over males with a mean +/- SD age of 50.5 +/- 15.9 years and a mean body mass index of 29.6 +/- 8.6 kg/m2. Of the remaining 87 sets of studies 69 (79.3%) demonstrated concordant findings regarding ureteral patency for the 2 imaging techniques and 18 (20.7%) were discordant. The nephrostomy tube was removed on the same day in 15 of the 17 patients who demonstrated antegrade urine flow only on contrast enhanced ultrasound and they had no subsequent adverse events. No adverse events were noted related to ultrasound contrast injection. While contrast enhanced ultrasound used no ionizing radiation, fluoroscopic nephrostograms provided a mean radiation exposure dose of 2.8 +/- 3.7 mGy., CONCLUSIONS: A contrast enhanced ultrasound nephrostogram can be safely performed to evaluate for ureteral patency following percutaneous nephrolithotomy. This imaging technique was mostly concordant with fluoroscopic findings. Most discordance was likely attributable to the higher sensitivity for patency of contrast enhanced ultrasound compared to fluoroscopy.

171,"In vitro schistosomicidal activity of the lignan (-)-6,6'-dinitrohinokinin (DNHK) loaded into poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles against Schistosoma mansoni CONTEXT: (-)-6,6'-Dinitrohinokinin (DNHK) display remarkable antiparasitic activity and was, therefore, incorporated into a nanoparticle formulation., OBJECTIVE: Incorporation of DNHK in poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles aiming to improve its biological activities., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Synthesis, characterization and incorporation of DNHK into glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation method. The nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, field emission electron microscopic scanning mansoni (FESEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). For the in vitro test with Schistosoma mansoni, the DNHK-loaded PLGA was diluted into the medium, and added at concentrations 10-200 microM to the culture medium containing one adult worm pair. The parasites were kept for 120 h and monitored every 24 h to evaluate their general condition, including: pairing, alterations in motor activity and mortality., RESULTS: The loaded PLGA nanoparticles gave an encapsulation efficiency of 42.2% and showed spherical characteristics in monodisperse polymeric matrix. The adult worm pairs were separated after 120 h of incubation for concentrations higher than 50 microM of DNHK-loaded PLGA. The groups incubated with 150 and 200 microM of DNHK-loaded PLGA for 24 and 120 h killed 100% of adult worms, afforded LC50 values of 137.0 +/- 2.12 microM and 79.01 +/- 1.90 microM, respectively, which was similar to the effect displayed by 10 microM of praziquantel., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of DNHK-loaded showed schistosomicidal activity and allowed its sustained release. The loaded PLGA system can be administered intravenously, as well as it may be internalized by endocytosis by the target organisms.",Excluded
1182,"A single antegrade intramedullary k-wire for fifth metacarpal neck fractures OBJECTIVES: Antegrade intramedullary nailing (AIMN) using 2k-wires seems to be superior to other modalities in treating displaced fractures of the fifth metacarpal neck (FFMN). Few reports demonstrated similar results retrospective with a single k-wire. The aim of the study is to describe our single k-wire technique and evaluate the related results. METHOD(S): This is a retrospective study of a continuous series of patients treated with a single intramedullary k-wire for FFMN. It includes 30 patients who met the criteria for surgery: a dorsal angulation of more than 30degree, malrotation, or both. The mean clinical follow-up period was 7+/-14.9 months. RESULT(S): The mean pre-operative angle was 50degree+/-11.35degree and the mean immediate post-operative angle was 4.86degree+/-2.8degree. The mean immediate correction was 47degree+/-9.3degree. The mean correction at last follow-up was 45.14degree+/-8.55degree. Healing was obtained in all patients and bone union was achieved at a mean of 5.6+/-1.2 weeks. The mean operative time was 8.5 min. The mean C-arm usage (number of clicks) was 7.2 times. The mean exposure radiation time was calculated at 3.6 s. The mean radiation dose was 0.08 mGy/mm2. The mean satisfaction score was 1.26+/-0.45. Quick-DASH and EQ-5D scores yielded excellent values. CONCLUSION(S): With potential benefits like lesser surgical time, radiation and cost, the use of a single AIMN could be safer, quicker and cheaper while reproducing similar clinical, functional and radiological outcomes to those reported with the use of 2k-wires.",Excluded
1905,"High pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels are associated with shorter overall survival in patients with small cell lung cancer OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels and survival in Chinese patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC)., METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 82 patients with SCLC treated at Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 2012 to January 2015. All patients were followed up. Associations between pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels measured by immunoturbidimetric assay and clinical outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses, using a cut-off level of 0.55 mg/L fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU)., RESULTS: Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in patients with low D-dimer levels (<=0.55 mg/L FEU; 8.0 and 17.0 months, respectively) compared with patients with high levels (>0.55 mg/L FEU; 5.0 and 9.0 months, respectively). Plasma D-dimer levels, Karnofsky performance status, N stage, TNM stage, treatment, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels were significantly associated with PFS, while D-dimer levels, N stage, TNM stage, and treatment were significantly associated with OS. Multivariate analysis revealed that TNM stage, treatment, and NSE levels were independently associated with PFS, while D-dimer levels and treatment were independently associated with OS., CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment plasma D-dimer levels were independently associated with OS in patients with SCLC.",Excluded
344,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included

3348,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and systemic treatments for extracerebral oligometastases, oligorecurrence, oligopersistence and oligoprogression from lung cancer BACKGROUND: Stereotactic irradiation (SBRT) is a standard of care for inoperable stage I lung cancer and brain oligometastases from lung cancer but is controversial for extracranial oligometastases. We assessed outcomes of lung cancer patients with extracranial metastases in oligometastatic, oligorecurrent, oligopersistent and oligoprogressive settings (""oligometastatic spectrum"") under strategies using SBRT +/- systemic treatments., METHODS: A retrospective multicentric study of consecutive lung cancer adult patients with 1-5 extracranial metastases treated with SBRT was conducted., RESULTS: Of 91 patients (99 metastases, median age 63, 64.8% adenocarcinomas, 19.8% molecular alterations), 11% had oligometastases, 49.5% oligorecurrence, 19.8% oligopersistence and 19.8% oligoprogression. Of 36% of patients under systemic treatments at initiation of SBRT, systemic treatment interruption was performed in 58% of them. With median follow up of 15.3 months, crude local control at irradiated metastases was 91%, while median distant progression-free survival (dPFS) and overall survival were 6.3 and 28.4 months (2-year survival 54%). Initial nodal stage and oligometastatic spectrum were prognostic factors for dPFS; age, initial primary stage and oligometastatic spectrum were prognostic factors for survival on multivariate analysis. Patients with oncogene-addicted tumors more frequently had oligoprogressive disease. Repeat ablative irradiations were preformed in 80% of patients who had oligorelapses. Worst acute toxicities consisted of 5.5% and one late toxic death occurred., CONCLUSION: The oligometastatic spectrum is a strong prognosticator in patients undergoing SBRT for extracranial metastases. Median survival was over two years but dPFS was about 6 months. Continuation of systemic therapy in oligoprogressive patients should be investigated.",Excluded
867,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
144,"Endoscopic esophageal reconstruction for the treatment of a total and extensive disruption of the esophagus using a ''rendez-vous'' technique INTRODUCTION: Complete esophageal obstruction leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses as an alternative to surgery that has high morbid-mortality. AIMS & METHODS: This is a case series report about six patients referred for complete esophageal disruption classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (> 5cm), one after caustic ingestion and two due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal. Two had an associated loss of the SES; 2/ Short disruption (< 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy for a neck neoplasia. They had been fasting for 3 to 18 months. All the procedures were performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, under anesthesia and with CO2 insufflation and X-rays guidance. RESULT(S): There were 3 men and women between 25 and 71 years old. All the reconstructions have been successful in one to three endoscopic sessions, using the non hydrophilic tip of a guide wire passed through a straight catheter in 5 cases and a EUS needle in only one case. In 2 cases, a neo-SES had to be created, by transillumination (n=1) or head and neck surgery (n=1). In order to guide the reconstruction, SEMS was used in one case, NGT in one case, and both were used in one patient. The first dilation was performed with a CRE balloon (12-15mm). All the patients could eat mixed after 2 POD. There was no intraoperative or post-operative complication. Then, the patients underwent 3 to 18 dilations sessions during 1.5 to 15 months; two are still undergoing dilations and all eat normally. CONCLUSION(S): Endoscopic rendez-vous for esophageal reconstruction is safe and effective in case of esophageal disruption even with loss of SES, avoiding surgery.",Excluded
1833,"Dose, volume, and function relationships in parotid salivary glands following conformal and intensity-modulated irradiation of head and neck cancer PURPOSE: To determine the relationships between the three-dimensional dose distributions in parotid glands and their saliva production, and to find the doses and irradiated volumes that permit preservation of the salivary flow following irradiation (RT)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-eight patients with head and neck cancer irradiated with parotid-sparing conformal and multisegmental intensity modulation techniques between March 1994 and August 1997 participated in the study. The mean dose and the partial volumes receiving specified doses were determined for each gland from dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Nonstimulated and stimulated saliva flow rates were selectively measured from each parotid gland before RT and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the completion of RT. The data were fit using a generalized linear model and the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of Lyman-Kutcher. In the latter model, a ""severe complication"" was defined as salivary flow rate reduced to < or =25% pre-RT flow at 12 months., RESULTS: Saliva flow rates data were available for 152 parotid glands. Glands receiving a mean dose below or equal to a threshold (24 Gy for the unstimulated and 26 Gy for the stimulated saliva) showed substantial preservation of the flow rates following RT and continued to improve over time (to median 76% and 114% of pre-RT for the unstimulated and stimulated flow rates, respectively, at 12 months). In contrast, most glands receiving a mean dose higher than the threshold produced little saliva with no recovery over time. The output was not found to decrease as mean dose increased, as long as the threshold dose was not reached. Similarly, partial volume thresholds were found: 67%, 45%, and 24% gland volumes receiving more than 15 Gy, 30 Gy, and 45 Gy, respectively. The partial volume thresholds correlated highly with the mean dose and did not add significantly to a model predicting the saliva flow rate from the mean dose and the time since RT. The NTCP model parameters were found to be TD50 (the tolerance dose for 50% complications rate for whole organ irradiated uniformly) = 28.4 Gy, n (volume dependence parameter) = 1, and m (the slope of the dose/response relationship) = 0.18. Clinical factors including age, gender, pre-RT surgery, chemotherapy, and certain medical conditions were not found to be significantly associated with the salivary flow rates. Medications (diuretics, antidepressants, and narcotics) were found to adversely affect the unstimulated but not the stimulated flow rates., CONCLUSIONS: Dose/volume/function relationships in the parotid glands are characterized by dose and volume thresholds, steep dose/response relationships when the thresholds are reached, and a maximal volume dependence parameter in the NTCP model. A parotid gland mean dose of < or =26 Gy should be a planning goal if substantial sparing of the gland function is desired.",Excluded
510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies. Watchful monitoring, corrections to calculated dose when changes observed are significant and radiotherapy accessories modification during the course of treatment are strongly recommended.",Excluded
2090,"Up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in radiation-induced heart injury in rats To explore the expression level and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in radiation-induced heart injury in a rat model, thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (the control group, the 15-Gy irradiation group and the 18-Gy irradiation group). Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation. PPAR-gamma may play an important role in radiation-induced heart injury.",Included
1167,"Clinical and Spectrophotometric Evaluation of Skin Photoadaptation in Vitiligo Patients after a Short Cycle of NB-UVB Phototherapy BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of photoadaptation to narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) radiation has been previously described in vitiligo and has usually been clinically measured by the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) after phototesting., OBJECTIVES: To assess the photoadaptive response in vitiligo and healthy skin after NB-UVB phototherapy not only clinically, but also by spectrophotometry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients affected by generalized vitiligo underwent NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly for 12 weeks. Before and after phototherapy, a phototesting procedure was administered on vitiligo patches and adjacent healthy skin with a solar simulated radiation (SSR). Visual assessment of the MED took place after 24 h. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the a* value and the melanin index (MI*), as signs of skin erythema and pigmentation. The photoadaptation factor (MED-PF) and the a* photoadaptation factor (a*-PF) were calculated., RESULTS: After NB-UVB phototherapy, both vitiligo and healthy skin showed an increase in MED and MI* values and a reduction of skin erythema compared to baseline (p < 0.05). MED-PF data showed a photoadaptation in 10 (71.4%) vitiligo lesions and in 12 (85.7%) healthy skin areas. The assessment of the a*-PF showed a negative mean percentage value in all affected and unaffected skin areas., CONCLUSIONS: A short cycle of NB-UVB phototherapy can induce photoadaptation in vitiligo by increasing the MED and reducing skin erythema after stimulation with SSR. This is most likely due to the physical filter function induced by ultraviolet radiation. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
3276,"Management of mediastinal relapse after treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy for stage I/II non-small-cell lung cancer Purpose/Objective(s): Regional failures occur in up to 15% of patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for stage I/II lung cancer. This report focuses on the management of the unique scenario of isolated regional failures. Method(s): Patients treated initially with SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy were screened for curative intent treatment of isolated mediastinal failures (IMFs). Local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and distant control were estimated from the date of salvage treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Among 160 patients treated from 2002 to 2012, 12 suffered IMF and were amenable to salvage treatment. The median interval between treatments was 16 months (2-57 mo). Median salvage dose was 66 Gy (60-70 Gy). With a median follow-up of 10 months, the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval, 5.8-37 mo). When estimated from original treatment, the median overall survival was 38 months (95% confidence interval, 17-71 mo). No subsequent regional failures occurred. Distant failure was the predominant mode of relapse following salvage for IMF with a 2-year distant control rate of 38%. At the time of this analysis, three patients have died without recurrence while four are alive and no evidence of disease. High-grade toxicity was uncommon. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is first analysis of salvage mediastinal radiation after SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung cancer. Outcomes appear similar to stage III disease at presentation. Distant failures were common, suggesting a role for concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. A standard full course of external beam radiotherapy is advisable in this unique clinical scenario.© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Reassessment was done at week 10. Thirty-one patients (males=17, females=14, median number of pretreatments: 3) were treated in seven cohorts. Escalation of injected activity was carried out in steps of 5 mCi/m2. Dosimetry was performed in the first 20 patients., RESULTS: The MTD was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities. Significant anemia only occurred at dose level 7. We observed the nadir of platelets after a median of 36 days from treatment with 177Lu-D-R and a nadir of granulocytes after a median of 50 days from 177Lu-D-R treatment. Non-hematological toxicity was negligible. We observed clinical responses at all dose levels and for all lymphoma entities. Some of the responses were durable; the longest follow up in complete remission is currently over eight years., CONCLUSION: The MTD of 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Non hematologic toxicity was negligible. Responses were seen in all lymphoma entities and at all dose levels tested. Further testing seems to be most promising mainly in follicular and marginal zone lymphoma in particular as the results compare well to other therapy options for these patients with regard to effectiveness, toxicity and discomfort for the patients.",Excluded
1224,"Handheld gamma probe used to detect accessory spleens during initial laparoscopic splenectomies BACKGROUND: Preoperative determination of the accessory spleen still is a major factor in the failure of both laparoscopic and conventional techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the practicability and efficacy of a handheld gamma probe in identifying accessory spleens at the initial intervention., METHODS: This study evaluated 17 patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy attributable to benign hematologic disorders. All the patients had preoperative ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scan, and nuclear scintigraphic examination of the abdominal cavity to assess the size of the spleen, and to determine the existence of the accessory spleen or spleens. For all the patients, a handheld gamma probe count was used intraoperatively as an adjuvant method to define the presence and location of the accessory splenic tissue. Control nuclear scintigraphic examinations of all the patients were performed 1 month after the surgical procedure., RESULTS: In two cases, intraoperatively accessory splenic tissue was detected by gamma probe, confirming the preoperative CT findings for the patients. One of these patients had three accessory spleens, although preoperative CT scan showed only two of them. However, by the help of the gamma probe, a third spleen located retroperitoneally was defined. For two patients, laparoscopic exploration and handheld gamma probe count did not identify any accessory splenic tissue, although preoperative CT scan indicated accessory spleens. For detecting accessory splenic tissue, the sensitivities of the studied techniques were 0% for ultrasonography, 75% for CT scan, 0% for preoperative nuclear scintigraphy, 75% for laparoscopic exploration, and 100% for perioperative gamma probe examination., CONCLUSION: Preoperative imaging methods for accessory spleen determination still have limited benefits because of their limited sensitivity. Thus, the handheld gamma probe technique may be an adjuvant method for laparoscopic exploration ensuring that no accessory splenic tissue is missed during the initial surgical treatment of benign hematologic disorders.",Excluded
693,"Reduction of patient radiation dose with a new organ based dose modulation technique for thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) (Liver dose right index) PURPOSE: To evaluate the radiation dose reduction, image quality and diagnostic confidence with thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography (TACT) using a new organ based dose modulation system (liver dose right index [Liver DRI]), compared to TACT using a standard automatic exposure control adjusting mA according to attenuation., METHODS: A total of 37 patients who had two TACT examinations on 2 different CT scanners, one using standard automatic exposure control (combination of a DoseRight automatic current selection and Z modulation) and one using Liver DRI were included. There were 19 men and 18 women with a mean age of 67.6+/-11.7 (SD) years (range: 36-85 years) For each patient, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated at each anatomic level (lung, breast, liver and pelvis area) for each protocol. Two radiologists assessed independently image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence., RESULTS: The radiation dose decreased significantly using Liver DRI compared to standard automatic exposure control on the total scan length, lung, breast and pelvis area, with a significant CTDIvol reduction of 27% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002), 24% (P=0.0002) and 31% (P=0.0001), respectively; and a significant SSDE reduction of 23% (P=0.0001), 28% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002) and 29% (P=0.0001), respectively. No significant SNR reductions were observed in all measured tissues at the level of the aortic arch, celiac trunk and iliac bifurcation, except in the muscle (P=0.0013) and fat tissue (P=0.0052) at the level of the ureteral meatus. No significant differences were noted between both protocols in overall image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence with an excellent inter observer agreement between radiologists (Kappa values of 0.83, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Liver DRI organ based dose modulation technique allows significant dose reduction compared to standard automatic exposure control while preserving diagnostic image quality in all thoraco-abdominopelvic areas.

638,"Dose-response study of intracoronary beta-radiation with 32P in balloon- and stent-injured coronary arteries in swine Purpose: A dose-response study was performed in swine to investigate the vascular effects of 32P over a broad range of doses in order to define the therapeutic window of intracoronary radiotherapy (ICR) with 32P. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
834,"Brachytherapy for early oral tongue cancer: low dose rate to high dose rate To examine the compatibility of low dose rate (LDR) with high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, we reviewed 399 patients with early oral tongue cancer (T1-2N0M0) treated solely by brachytherapy at Osaka University Hospital between 1967 and 1999. For patients in the LDR group (n = 341), the treatment sources consisted of Ir-192 pin for 227 patients (1973-1996; irradiated dose, 61-85 Gy; median, 70 Gy), Ra-226 needle for 113 patients (1967-1986; 55-93 Gy; median, 70 Gy). Ra-226 and Ir-192 were combined for one patient. Ir-192 HDR (microSelectron-HDR) was used for 58 patients in the HDR group (1991-present; 48-60 Gy; median, 60 Gy). LDR implantations were performed via oral and HDR via a submental/submandibular approach. The dose rates at the reference point for the LDR group were 0.30 to 0.8 Gy/h, and for the HDR group 1.0 to 3.4 Gy/min. The patients in the HDR group received a total dose of 48-60 Gy (8-10 fractions) during one week. Two fractions were administered per day (at least a 6-h interval). The 3- and 5-year local control rates for patients in the LDR group were 85% and 80%, respectively, and those in the HDR group were both 84%. HDR brachytherapy showed the same lymph-node control rate as did LDR brachytherapy (67% at 5 years). HDR brachytherapy achieved the same locoregional result as did LDR brachytherapy. A converting factor of 0.86 is applicable for HDR in the treatment of early oral tongue cancer.",Excluded
321,"Longstanding symptomatic choroidal hemangioma managed with limited PDT as initial or salvage therapy Purpose: To describe the use of limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of symptomatic choroidal hemangiomas. Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma were treated with limited PDT 6 min following a 1-min infusion with verteporfin (6 mg/m2 body surface area), using a diode laser (692 nm) and a single spot large enough to cover only the most prominent part of the tumor. Exposure time was 166 s in the first three patients and 83 s in the last ten patients, resulting in a radiance exposure of respectively 100 and 50 J/cm2. Result(s): In all 11 not previously conventionally treated patients, visual acuity improved following PDT treatment. The two remaining patients with prior radiation treatment both reported widening of the visual field and sharper vision, but did not show an increase in ETDRS vision. In all but four patients the tumor became ultrasonographically undetectable by the first follow-up visit at 6 weeks, with only a slight irregularity at the level of the previous tumor remaining. In four patients the residual tumor was still detectable, and they received a second treatment, following which the tumor flattened completely. In all patients the retinal detachment disappeared. Conclusion(s): The present series demonstrates that even limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is an effective first-line treatment for choroidal hemangiomas.",Excluded
675,"Modalities of surveillance in treated nasopharyngeal cancer OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of different modalities in the detection of disease during the early posttreatment period of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We prospectively evaluated 57 patients with NPC who were treated with radiation. A postnasal space (PNS) biopsy, an endoscopic examination, and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 4 months after treatment. RESULT(S): Four patients had evidence of disease in the PNS biopsy specimen. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the endoscopic examination were 75%, 94.3%, 50%, and 98%, respectively, while those of the CT scan were 50%, 49.1%, 6.9%, and 92.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In the early postradiation period for patients with NPC, an endoscopic examination is a suitable surveillance modality, but routine CT scanning has no added clinical benefit. SIGNIFICANCE: When an endoscopic examination of the PNS yields normal results, a biopsy is not necessary because the likelihood of disease is low.",Excluded
3444,"Myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplantation for acute leukemia patients between 50 and 55 years of age: Single institutional retrospective comparison with patients younger than 50 years of age Increasing recipient age is a well-known risk factor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and treatment-related mortality (TRM) and has a negative impact on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Since the incidence of severe GVHD after cord blood transplantation (CBT) is lower than that after transplants using bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood grafts from adult cells, we should expect better outcomes from CBT in older patients. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of myeloablative unrelated CBT in patients aged between 50 and 55 years, we performed a retrospective comparison of 100 patients with acute leukemia who received cord blood grafts at our institution. Nineteen older patients (median age, 52; range, 50-55) and 81 younger patients (median, 36; range, 16-49) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen including 12 Gy of total body irradiation and chemotherapy. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine with (n = 96) or without (n = 4) methotrexate. There were no significant differences in the incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD, extensive-type chronic GVHD, TRM, and the probability of overall and disease-free survival between these groups. These results suggest that, in patients with acute leukemia, myeloablative CBT might be as safe and effective in patients aged between 50 and 55 years as in younger patients. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",Excluded
2703,"Measuring and assessing individual external doses during the rehabilitation phase in Iitate village after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011, Iitate village was placed under an evacuation order because the level of radioactive materials drifting from the nuclear plant to the village was above a government-set level for allowing residents to live in the area. The evacuation advisory for most of the village was lifted on 31 March 2017. For displaced residents deciding whether or not to return to their homes, it is important to correctly understand and estimate the realistic individual external doses they will receive after returning to the village. In this study, with the support of residents of the village, we used a personal dosimeter (D-Shuttle) coupled with a global positioning system device to measure and thus understand realistic individual external doses while the residents were in Iitate village and to project the individual external doses for different administrative districts as of 1 April 2017. The measured individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle for 38 study participants showed that the doses measured during time spent inside the village were higher and more widely distributed than the doses measured during time spent outside the village. The exposure ratio (ER) was defined as the ratio of additional individual external dose measured by D-Shuttle to the additional ambient dose based on an airborne monitoring survey. The medians of the average ERs were 0.13 (min-max 0.06-0.27) for time spent at home and 0.18 (min-max 0.08-0.36) for time spent outdoors. Projected additional annual individual external doses as of 1 April 2017 for different administrative districts in the village were calculated using ERs obtained in this study. Assuming that individuals spent 8 h per day on outdoor activities and 16 h on indoor activities, additional annual individual external doses were estimated to be below 3 mSv using the mean of the average ERs for most districts in the village, and these values were well below the individual external doses estimated using the approach taken by the central government. The results of this study provide valuable information both for understanding realistic radiological situations in the village and for those who want to know their future individual external dose in order to make a decision on whether or not to live in the village.",Excluded
1113,"Diagnostic yield of CT pulmonary angiography for pulmonary embolism in clinically suspected patients ABSTRACT: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common medical problem. Its diagnostic criteria must be reviewed to determine the need for confirmatory testing. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the current standard of care, which provides accurate diagnosis with rapid turnaround. This study aimed to estimate the diagnostic yield of CTPA in clinically suspected PE patients in a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia.Radiology records of all patients with clinically suspected PE who underwent CTPA between January 1, 2012 and September 30, 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. A radiologist with 10 years of professional experience interpreted and reported all cases. The Wells score with 2 tiers (likely and unlikely) was used to raise the clinical suspicion of PE.Positive results for PE were reported in 177 out of 534 clinically suspected cases (33%). Among the positive PE cases, 143 were acute (81%) and 34 (19%) were chronic. Bilateral, right-sided, and left-sided PE were found in 115 (65%), 37 (21%), and 25 (14%) cases, respectively. Involvement of the segmental branches, subsegmental branches, and the pulmonary trunk were noted in 152 (86%), 70 (40%), and 9 cases (5%), respectively. Saddle PE was found in (4%) of the cases. The lower lobe branches (right 55%, left 53%) and the upper lobe branches (right 47%, left 41%) were the most common sites of involvement.CTPA had a higher positive detection rate for PE among clinically suspected cases than its published diagnostic yield. Adequate clinical evaluation when selecting patients for CTPA is emphasized to minimize unjustified exposure of the patients to radiation and intravenous contrast administration. It is crucial for radiologists to provide detailed reports commenting on all relevant findings, including pertinent negatives. A template for reporting radiological findings for CTPA can be recommended for this purpose.Copyright © 2021 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
2368,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009).

3459,"Osteoradionecrosis of the cervical vertebrae in patients irradiated for head and neck cancers Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is one of the common late adverse effects that follow radiation therapy for head and neck cancers. ORN usually develops on the mandible and less frequently on the maxilla. We present three cases of ORN of the cervical vertebrae, which is rarely reported. Two patients suffered from secondary osteomyelitis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy with a hyperfractionated and an accelerated hyperfractionated regimen, respectively. For these patients, the high intensity of treatment was considered the cause of ORN. The third patient underwent concurrent chemoradiation therapy for upper thoracic esophageal cancer and subsequently underwent endoscopic laser resection and radiation therapy for hypopharyngeal cancer. ORN developed in the area of reirradiation. In this case, an excessive radiation dose was considered the cause. ORN of cervical vertebrae, different from that of the mandible and maxilla, has a risk of radiculopathy and myelopathy. In the future, ORN of cervical vertebrae will increase because metachronous double cancers will increase and opportunities for reirradiation, in turn, will increase. To prevent this, it is necessary to optimize the treatment schedule for radiation therapy, including the total dose, fractionation, and concurrent chemotherapy, and to decrease the volume of cervical vertebrae within the irradiation field. © 2010 Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
2268,"Impact of PET/CT on precise radiotherapy planning for non-small cell lung cancer OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of PET/CT on the clinical staging, target volume delineation and precise radiotherapy (PAR) planning for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): PET/CT scanning was performed in 58 histologically proven NSCLC patients for radical radiotherapy or surgery. The clinical staging of all patients was determined by PET/CT according to 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) staging system. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated and three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) planning was established with identical parameters based on CT image and PET/CT fused image, respectively. The indexes including volume of GTV (V(GTV)), percentage of the total lung volume which received more than 20 Gy (V(20)), mean lung dose (MLD), tumor control probability (TCP), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), and dose to spinal cord (Ds) were selected and evaluated. The quality of the two plans and the impact of PET/CT on PAR planning was compare and analyzed. RESULT(S): 1. PET/CT image results changed the clinical stages in 21 of 58 (36.2%) patients with 14 upstaged and 7 downstaged, therefore, the management decisions were modified in 16 (27.6%) patients. 2. Among 32 patients who underwent surgery, PET/CT staging result was consistent with pathologic staging in 29 with one false negative and 2 false positive in lymph node staging. The sensitivity of PET/CT was 96.9% and accuracy 90.6%. 3. The differences of indexes including V(GTV) (P = 0.004), V(20) (P = 0.000) and MLD (P = 0.004) between the two radiotherapy plannings were statistically significant, whereas, the Ds, TCP and NTCP (left lung, right lung, skin and spinal cord) was not. CONCLUSION(S): 1. The impact PET/CT on clinical staging of NSCLC and PAR planning was remarkable. 2. PET/CT is more consistent with pathology in staging than CT and, therefore, is an important compensatory staging measure. 3. Compared with CT, PET/CT can reduce the V(GTV) in patients with atelectasis and obstructive pneumonitis when contouring the target volume, so can provide better protection for normal surrounding lung tissue. On the other hand, PET/CT is more sensitive in detecting mediastinal lymph node metastasis than CT, and the V(GTV) can be more precise and guaranteed. 4. Radiopneumonitis may be more effectively prevented because of significant decrease in V(20) and MLD by more precise planning based on PET/CT results. 5. PET/CT not only can provide satisfactory Ds, TCP and NTCP within clinical demand, but also more precise delineation of the radiation target volume and precise radiotherapy planning for NSCLC.",Excluded

We prospectively studied the dose-volume relationship for larynx substructures and aspiration. Method(s): Forty nine patients with stage III/IV head-and-neck (H&N) squamous cell carcinoma were prospectively enrolled in this IRB-approved, federally funded study. All patients received IMRT-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and were scheduled for videofluorography (VFG) prior to CRT and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months post-CRT. Twelve laryngeal substructures were contoured in each patient: thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, total epiglottis, suprahyoid epiglottis, infrahyoid epiglottis, total larynx, supraglottic larynx, subglottic larynx, glottic larynx, arytenoids, aryepiglottic (AE) folds, and glossoepiglottic fold. After exclusions, 29 patients were included in the final analysis. Incidence of aspiration at 1 year following CRT was correlated with dose-volume data to laryngeal substructures using logistic regression. Result(s): The median age was 54 years with 79% being non-smokers. Tumor sites included oropharynx (22), unknown primary (6), and hypopharynx (1). One year following CRT, 10/29 (34%) showed aspiration on VFG. Dose to the AE folds showed the highest correlation with aspiration at 12 months and was significant on multivariate analysis (p = 0.025). A mean dose cutpoint of 6500 cGy or higher to the AE folds was associated with an increased risk of aspiration at 1 year [positive likelihood ratio (+LR) 2.81, positive predictive value (PPV) 60%, negative predictive value (NPV) 92.9%, relative risk (RR) 8.4]. Conclusion(s): In this analysis, mean dose to the AE folds was associated with an increased risk of aspiration at 1 year.

2661,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included
753,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancer-a phase I-II study of radiotherapy with dose escalation of weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine chemotherapy Background: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil improves gastric cancer outcome. We previously demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy with a more intensified-and therefore potentially more effective-schedule with daily cisplatin and oral capecitabine is feasible. Because such an intensive schedule requires an extensive logistic infrastructure which is not available in every hospital, we additionally investigated the tolerability of this combined regimen with weekly instead of daily cisplatin in a dose-escalation study. Patients and Methods: After R0 or R1 resection, treatment initiated with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 2 weeks and 1-week rest. Subsequently, patients received capecitabine (575-650 mg/m2 orally b.i.d., 5 days/week) and cisplatin (20-25 mg/m2 i.v., once weekly) according to a predefined dose-escalation schedule concurrent with radiation. Radiotherapy was given to a fixed total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Result(s): Thirty-one patients were eligible and started treatment. During chemoradiotherapy, seven patients developed 10 items of grade III and one episode of grade IV (mainly hematological) toxicity (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0). The maximum tolerable dose was determined to be for cisplatin 20 mg/m2 i.v. weekly and for capecitabine 575 mg/m2 b.i.d. orally.

804,"Cause-of-death registers in radiation-contaminated areas of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan Since the early 1990s, information on radiation-exposed populations other than those exposed from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 has become increasingly available for international scientific research. It is essential to understand how the cohorts of exposed populations have been defined and what mechanisms can be used to study their health outcomes. Different international scientific research collaborations currently investigate four population groups chronically exposed to ionizing radiation during the late 1940s and early 1950s in the Russian Federation and in Kazakhstan. In this framework, collaborations have been established to develop cause-of-death registers in each of these four areas for future mortality follow-up purposes with the aim of studying the health effects of ionizing radiation. The emphasis of this effort is on assessing the information sources available, the mechanisms of data collection and coding, and the data quality and completeness of the information collected. One of the major challenges is the harmonization of all these aspects between the four different centers to the extent possible, taking into account that much of the actual data has been collected over many decades.",Excluded
3471,"Magnetic navigation in left-sided AV reentrant tachycardias: Preliminary results of a retrograde approach Introduction: A novel magnetic navigation system allows remote guidance of floppy radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheters. We evaluated the feasibility of mapping and ablation of left-sided accessory pathways (APs) using the retrograde transaortic approach with this system. This might open the gate to retrograde ablation of left atrial arrhythmias. Methods and Results: Twenty consecutive patients were included. A Helios II was used in five and in 15 a Celsius RMT RF catheter with higher magnetic mass and different flexibility was used. Mapping and ablation were attempted. The learning curve was analyzed. Ablation was acutely successful in 60% of the patients using the Helios II and in 80% using the Celsius RMT. Median procedure time was 158 minutes, with median patient and physician fluoroscopy times of 26 and 4 minutes. In the last 10 patients, procedure times became significantly shorter (median 122 minutes, only Celsius RMT catheters) and standard catheters had to be used only twice. No complications occurred. Conclusion(s): Remote retrograde transaortic RF ablation of left-sided APs is feasible, safe, and reduces the physician's fluoroscopy exposure. There is a very steep initial learning curve, with the success rate increasing from 50% in the first 10 cases to 80% in the last 10 cases.

Method(s): In a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, 13 healthy participants were randomized to rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., or placebo. On day 3, fasting gastric volume was measured using intravenous 99mTc- pertechnate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After the last dose of study medication, an 111In-chloride egg meal (300 kcal) was ingested, and postprandial gastric volume and emptying were measured by SPECT. Symptom ratings using a visual analogue scale (fullness, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, aggregate score) were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min postprandially. Group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in gastric volume or emptying in the two groups. However, there was a borderline increase in gastric volume with rabeprazole compared with placebo.

2613,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: comparison of conventional radiotherapy and hyperfractionation chemoradiotherapy in two groups Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a highly aggressive neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Curative management of these tumors has been difficult secondary to delayed diagnosis and advanced disease at presentation. Treatment modalities including surgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success in controlling these tumors. Median survival time is often measured in months. A review of all patients treated between 1952 and 1999 identified 32 patients with anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Patients were divided into two groups: those treated between 1952 to 1980 (9 patients, group 1) and those treated between 1981 and 1999 (23 patients, group 2). Most group 1 patients received once-daily radiotherapy and most group 2 patients received twice-daily radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy. A variety of radiotherapy techniques were used. Chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, vincristine, or cisplatin. Eleven patients presented with lymph node metastasis and two patients had distant metastases at diagnosis. The most common clinical presentation was a neck mass in 17 patients. In group 1, one patient was treated with surgery only, four with surgery and radiotherapy and four with radiotherapy alone. In group 2, 1 patient was treated with surgery only; 3 with surgery and radiotherapy; 10 with radiotherapy and chemotherapy; 5 with surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy; and 5 with radiotherapy alone. Overall 2-year survival rates were 44% for group 1 and 52% for group 2. Two-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 53% for group 1 and 38% for group 2. Five (16%) patients died within 60 days of diagnosis. Severe side effects included skin sequelae (one patient) and osteoradionecrosis of the mandible (one patient). There were 10 (52%) long-term survivors (>2 years). Clinicopathologic features associated with extended survival were limited extent of disease and inclusion in group 2. Among patients with ATC surgery, hyperfractionated radiotherapy in conjunction with chemotherapy is associated with better survival but not PFS compared to conventional radiotherapy.",Excluded
2592,"The value of enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of endocochlear disease BACKGROUND: Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (GdMRI) is routinely used in the evaluation and management of suspected retrocochlear pathology such as vestibular schwannoma. However, its value in the evaluation and diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been less clear., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of case histories and imaging studies of patients with SNHL and cochlear enhancement on GdMRI diagnosed between 1998 and 2000., RESULTS: Five patients with SNHL who required gadolinium administration to establish the diagnosis of endocochlear disease were identified. Diagnosed lesions included an intralabyrinthine schwannoma, intracochlear hemorrhage, radiation-induced ischemic change, autoimmune labyrinthitis, and meningogenic labyrinthitis. In these illustrative cases, the GdMRI demonstrated intrinsic high signal or contrast enhancement within the cochlea and labyrinth in the absence of a retrocochlear mass. In one patient with meningogenic labyrinthitis, cochlear enhancement on MRI led to prompt cochlear implantation before the potential development of cochlear ossification., CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that GdMRI plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of cochlear pathology associated with sensorineural hearing loss and may directly impact patient management.",Excluded
2940,"Sunlight exposure in inflammatory bowel disease outpatients: Predictive factors and correlation with serum vitaminD INTRODUCTION: Sunlight exposure is the main source of vitaminD. Our aim was to describe both sun exposure and sun protection behaviour in a series of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to study their potential association with vitaminD concentration., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross sectional, observational study. The clinical-demographic variables were obtained via clinical interviews and medical history review. The sunlight exposure assessment was carried out using the Sun Exposure Questionnaire and the concentration of 25-hydroxy vitaminD (25OHD) was measured by an electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay. Questionnaires were conducted on quality of life, physical activity, weekly vitaminD intake and sun protection behaviour., RESULTS: 149 patients were included. In 69% of patients, deficient or insufficient 25OHD values were recorded. 67% showed low sun exposure. A modest significant correlation was observed between the total score of the solar exposure questionnaire and the 25OHD concentration in the complete series (r=0.226, P=.006) and in the summer (r=0.274, P=.01). The sun protection behaviour questionnaire score did not influence the 25OHD concentration. In the multivariate analysis, only the presence of clinical activity was associated with low sun exposure (OR=3.23)., DISCUSSION: Sun exposure according to the questionnaire used was low, was associated with the presence of clinical activity and was weakly correlated with serum 25OHD concentration. More studies are needed to explore the use of individual questionnaires for sun exposure and its relationship with vitaminD in patients with IBD. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

2859,"Efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma Background: Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is primary extranodal lymphoma, most common in young women and characterized mainly by the growth of locally tumor within the upper mediastinum with frequent development of pleuritis, pericarditis and syndrome of the vena cava superior. Until now, there is not standard of first line therapy, in particular, discussed the efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens and feasibility of radiation therapy. The risk of developing secondary tumors and cardiopulmonary complications, on the one hand, and extremely poor prognosis in the case of relapse, on the other hand, do highly relevant research in this area. Method(s): We identified 86 pts with PMBCL treated in N.N. Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center during last 10 years (2004-2014). The median age was 29 years (15-63), 56% were female, 62% had I/ IIE stages, LDH elevated in 81% pts. Patients received three different regimens chemotherapy (CT): MACOP-B +/- R- 52 patients (group 1), R-CHOP -18 patients (group 2), R-EPOCH - 16 patients (group 3). Radiation therapy to the mediastinum received 69 (80%) patients. Result(s): With a median follow 34 months, progression-free survival (PFS) was 80%, overall survival (OS) - 86%. There is no significant differences in PFS and OS depending on the CT regimens (p = 0.1). It should be noted that none of the 16 patients treated on EPOCHR, had relapse or disease progression. Conclusion(s): Immunochemotherapy combined with local irradiation is standard treatment PMBCL. Perhaps, more number of patients will be able to demonstrate significant benefit of intensive chemotherapy regimens before the R-CHOP.",Excluded
2943,"Radiation-induced coronary artery disease Excessive unprotected radiation to the heart appears to lead to the development of CAD, even in the absence of significant cardiovascular risk factors. The coexistence of such factors may enhance the probability of CAD. The presence of hypercholesterolemia and concomitant or sequential use of chemotherapeutic agents (especially doxorubicin) could further increase this risk. Therapeutic decisions, as with any other manifestation of CAD, relate to the extent of myocardium at jeopardy and to the overall diffuseness of CAD. Management options possible are PTCA or coronary artery bypass surgery. The latter may be required in left main artery stenosis and complicated ostial lesions. Use of shielding should decrease the associated risk of radiation-induced CAD in future years. However, clinicians should continue to have a high degree of suspicion of CAD in patients treated with thoracic radiation without cardiac shielding.",Excluded
2277,"Tolerability of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older Purpose: To determine the rate of treatment deviations during combined modality therapy for rectal cancer in elderly patients aged 75 years and older. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the records of consecutively treated patients with rectal cancer aged 75 years and older treated with combined modality therapy at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham & Women's Hospital from 2002 to 2007. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment deviation, defined as a treatment break, dose reduction, early discontinuation of therapy, or hospitalization during combined modality therapy. Patient comorbidity was rated using the validated Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27 Test (ACE-27) comorbidity index. Fisher's exact test and the Mantel-Haenszel trend test were used to identify predictors of treatment tolerability. Result(s): Thirty-six eligible patients had a median age of 79.0 years (range, 75-87 years); 53% (19/36) had no or mild comorbidity and 47% (17/36) had moderate or severe comorbidity. In all, 58% of patients (21/36) were treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and 33% (12/36) with postoperative CRT. Although 92% patients (33/36) completed the planned radiotherapy (RT) dose, 25% (9/36) required an RT-treatment break, 11% (4/36) were hospitalized, and 33% (12/36) had a dose reduction, break, or discontinuation of concurrent chemotherapy. In all, 39% of patients (14/36) completed >=4 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 17% (6/36) completed therapy without a treatment deviation. More patients with no to mild comorbidity completed treatment than did patients with moderate to severe comorbidity (21% vs. 12%, p = 0.66). The rate of deviation did not differ between patients who had preoperative or postoperative CRT (19% vs. 17%, p = 1.0). Conclusion(s): The majority of elderly patients with rectal cancer in this series required early termination of treatment, treatment interruptions, or dose reductions. These data suggest that further intensification of combined modality therapy for rectal cancer should be performed with caution in elderly patients, who require aggressive supportive care to complete treatment. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1428,"Scanning beyond anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT: findings, radiation dose, and automatic tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine additional radiation dose associated with scanning beyond the anatomic limits of the thorax in chest CT protocol and to assess the effect of z-axis modulation on the additional radiation dose associated with the scanning protocol. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ""Extra"" images for routine chest CT were defined as those above lung apices (supraapical) and those caudal to the lowermost portion of lung parenchyma (infrapulmonary), including images obtained beyond the adrenal glands (infraadrenal). One hundred and forty-eight consecutive chest CT examinations (70 men, 78 women; age range, 15-90 years) performed September 13-25, 2003, were reviewed to determine the number of supraapical, infrapulmonary, and infraadrenal extra images. All examinations were performed using z-axis modulation (n = 70) or fixed tube current (n = 78). The CT dose index volume and dose-length product (DLP) values for the extra images were calculated. Two radiologists reviewed these extra images for pathologic findings. Student's t test was used to perform the statistical analysis. RESULT(S): One hundred forty-four (97%) examinations had supraapical extra images and 145 (98%) had infrapulmonary extra images. A total of 31 additional findings were observed in extra images. Most clinically important findings were identified in patients with a history of malignancy. With z-axis modulation, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 39.98 mGy x cm and 132.59 mGy x cm, respectively. With fixed tube current, the mean DLP for supraapical and infrapulmonary extra images was 30.31 mGy x cm and 95.91 mGy x cm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): A substantial number of extra images are acquired during chest CT that do not add clinically important information in patients with nonmalignant indications. The use of z-axis modulation increased radiation dose for the extra images.",Excluded
3246,"Prospective trial of the detection of urolithiasis on ultralow dose (Sub mSv) noncontrast computerized tomography: Direct comparison against routine low dose reference standard Purpose: In this prospective trial we compared ultralow dose computerized tomography reconstruction algorithms and routine low dose computerized tomography for detecting urolithiasis., Materials and Methods: A total of 48 consenting adults prospectively underwent routine low dose noncontrast computerized tomography immediately followed by an ultralow dose series targeted at a 70% to 90% reduction from the routine low dose technique (sub mSv range). Ultralow dose series were reconstructed with filtered back projection, and adaptive statistical and model based iterative reconstruction techniques. Transverse (axial) and coronal images were sequentially reviewed by 3 relatively inexperienced trainees, including a radiology resident, a urology fellow and an abdominal imaging fellow. Three experienced abdominal radiologists independently reviewed the routine low dose filtered back projection images, which served as the reference standard., Results: The mean effective dose for the ultralow dose scans was 0.91 mSv (median 0.82), representing a mean+/-SD 78%+/-5% decrease compared to the routine low dose. Overall sensitivity and positive predictive value per stone for ultralow dose computerized tomography at a 4 mm threshold was 0.91 and 0.98, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy per patient were 0.87, 1.00, 1.00, 0.94 and 0.96, respectively. At a 4 mm threshold the sensitivity and positive predictive value per stone of the ultralow dose series for filtered back projection, and adaptive statistical and model based iterative reconstruction was 0.89 and 0.96, 0.91 and 0.98, and 0.93 and 1.00, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy per patient at the 4 mm threshold were 0.82, 1.00, 1.00, 0.91 and 0.94 for filtered back projection, 0.85, 1.00, 1.00, 0.93 and 0.95 for adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and 0.94, 1.00, 1.00, 0.97 and 0.98 for model based iterative reconstruction, respectively. Sequential review of coronal images changed the final stone reading in 13% of cases and improved diagnostic confidence in 49%., Conclusions: At a 4 mm renal calculus size threshold ultralow dose computerized tomography is accurate for detection when referenced against routine low dose series with dose reduction to below the level of a typical 2-view plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder. Slight differences were seen among the reconstruction algorithms. There was mild improvement with model based iterative reconstruction over filtered back projection and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction. Coronal images improved detection and diagnostic confidence over axial images alone.Copyright © 2014 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded
913,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas? Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included
1164,"A review of the effects of uranium and depleted uranium exposure on reproduction and fetal development Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating munitions, military vehicle armor, and aircraft, ship and missile counterweighting/ballasting, as well as in a number of other military and commercial applications. Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded
1326,"Meteorological factors and psychiatric emergencies Introduction. Studies conducted in the psychiatric setting and related with biometeorology generally coincide that there is a seasonal rhythm between seasons and depressive disorders, violent suicides and manic episodes. However, there are many discrepancies about the correlation of specific meteorological variables with the remaining clinical pictures. This work has aimed to study a wide sample of psychiatric cases in this area (Baix Camp/Tarragona) to see whether there is a relationship between meteorological variables and the total number of daily emergencies. Method. We recorded the data of 3,048 cases attended in the Emergency Department of the Hospital Pere Mata de Reus (Tarragona) from January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2005. The possible relationship between the number of daily visits and different meteorological end- points (such as wind direction and speed, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure and solar radiation) were analyzed statistically. Results. The results were statistically significant for the meteorological cndpoints of medium temperature (TMED), maximum temperature (TMAX) and minimum temperature (TMIN). The relationship between humidity and number of daily visits was also statistically significant (non-linear form). The remaining comparisons did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions. The main conclusion of our study is that there is a direct relationship between environmental temperature increase and the number of patients attended in the hospital emergency department. A relationship could also be observed in regards to humidity. This fact may suggest the need to have suitable medical attendance planning for the hottest and most humid periods.",Excluded
231,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
2094,"Aldehyde dehydrogenase, a therapeutic target in chordoma: Analysis in 3d cellular models Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors of the axial skeleton. These tumors are locally aggressive and refractory to conventional therapies. Radical surgery and radiation remain the first-line treatments. Despite these aggressive treatments, chordomas often recur and second-line treatment options are limited. The mechanisms underlying chordoma radioresistance remain unknown, although several radioresistant cancer cells have been shown to respond favorably to aldehyde de-hydrogenase (ALDH) inhibition. The study of chordoma has been delayed by small patient cohorts and few available models due to the scarcity of these tumors. We thus created cellular 3D models of chordoma by using low-adherence culture systems. Then, we evaluated their radiosensitivity using colony-forming and spheroid size assays. Finally, we determined whether pharmacologically inhibiting ALDH increased their radiosensitivity. We found that 3D cellular models of chordoma (derived from primary, relapse, and metastatic tumors) reproduce the histological and gene expression features of the disease. The metastatic, relapse, and primary spheroids displayed high, me-dium, and low radioresistance, respectively. Moreover, inhibiting ALDH decreased the radiore-sistance in all three models.Copyright © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
2190,"Pulmonary emphysema: radiation dose and section thickness at multidetector CT quantification--comparison with macroscopic and microscopic morphometry PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate the effects of radiation dose and section thickness on quantitative multidetector computed tomographic (CT) indexes of pulmonary emphysema., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Seventy patients (49 men, 21 women; age range, 38-79 years) referred for surgical resection of a lung tumor underwent multidetector CT with 4 x 1-mm collimation, 120 kVp, and 20 and 120 effective mAs. At each radiation dose, 1.25-, 5.0-, and 10.0-mm-thick sections were reconstructed at 10-mm intervals. From scans of the lobe or whole lung to be resected, relative areas (RAs) of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than nine thresholds and eight percentiles of the distribution of attenuation coefficients were compared with the histopathologic extent of emphysema, which was measured microscopically--by using the corrected mean interwall distance (MIWD) and the corrected mean perimeter (MP)--and macroscopically. Correlations between the data obtained by using attenuation thresholds and percentiles and the parameters macroscopic extent of emphysema, MIWD, and MP were investigated by using Spearman coefficients., RESULTS: The 1st percentile (r range, -0.394 to -0.675; P < .001) and attenuation coefficients of -980, -970, and -960 HU (r range, 0.478-0.664; P < .001) yielded the strongest correlations with macroscopic extent, MIWD, and MP, regardless of radiation dose or section thickness. The effects of radiation dose and section thickness on RAs of lung with attenuation coefficients lower than -960 HU (P = .007 and P < .001, respectively) and lower than -970 HU (P = .001 and P < .001, respectively) were significant. The effect of section thickness on the 1st percentile was significant (P < .001), whereas the effect of dose was not (P = .910)., CONCLUSION: At CT quantification of pulmonary emphysema, the tube current-time product can be reduced to 20 mAs, but both tube current-time product and section thickness should be kept constant in follow-up examinations.",Excluded

Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage.

1206,"Focal radiation therapy of brain metastases after complete surgical resection Brain metastases are a frequent occurrence in cancer patients and result in significant morbidity and mortality. The three main treatments for brain metastases include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy, alone or in combination. After resection alone, local recurrence rates are high. Whole brain radiation therapy can decrease the probability of recurrence; however, this has some disadvantages. Focal radiation therapy (FRT) may provide many of the same benefits without some of these disadvantages. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed patients with single brain metastases treated with FRT after surgery. Doses ranged from 14 Gy as single dose stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to 54 Gy in 27 2-Gy fractions as conformal fractionated radiotherapy. Four of the seven patients had a same-site recurrence, with an average time to recurrence of 115.5 d. Median dose in the patients that had same-site recurrence was 42 Gy. One of these patients is currently living. Two patients did not have recurrence, and one patient had a recurrence at a different site within the brain. The low rate of out-of-field recurrences during the patients life indicates focal radiation may be a reasonable therapeutic alternative. Given the number of patients with same-site recurrences, wide field margins around the tumor volume or higher radiation doses than those typically used in palliative regimens may be useful in post-excisional FRT. Additionally, we found that a longer delay in the initiation of FRT after initial diagnosis may result in a decreased time to same-site recurrence. However, further studies are warranted given the small number of patients in this study.",Excluded

3278,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

2373,"The complex relationship between lung tumor volume and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated by definitive radiotherapy: A prospective, observational prognostic factor study of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG 99.05) Background and purpose: To investigate the hypothesis that primary tumor volume is prognostic independent of T and N stages in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by definitive radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Multicenter prospective observational study. Patient eligibility: pathologically proven stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer planned for definitive radiotherapy (minimum 50 Gy in 20 fractions) using CT-based contouring. Volumes of the primary tumor and enlarged nodes were measured according to a standardized protocol. Survival was adjusted for the effect of T and N stage. Result(s): There were 509 eligible patients. Five-year survival rates for tumor volume grouped by quartiles were, for increasing tumor volume, 22%, 14%, 15% and 21%. Larger primary tumor volume was associated with shorter survival (HR = 1.060 (per doubling); 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.029). However, after adjusting for the effects of T and N stage, there was no evidence for an association (HR = 1.029, 95% CI, 0.96-1.10, P = 0.39). There was evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume was associated with an increased risk of dying, independently of T and N stage, in the first 18 months but not beyond. Conclusion(s): In patients treated by non-surgical means we were unable to show that lung tumor volume, overall, provides additional prognostic information beyond the T and N stage (TNM, 6th edition). There is evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume adversely affects outcome only within the first 18 months. Larger tumor size alone should not by itself exclude patients from curative (chemo)radiotherapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1977,"The risk of cataractogenesis after gamma knife radiosurgery: a nationwide population based case-control study BACKGROUND: Medical radiation is considered a factor responsible for cataractogenesis. However, the incidence of this ophthalmologic complication resulting from gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has not yet been reported. The present study aimed to determine the risk of cataractogenesis associated with radiation exposure from GKRS., METHODS: This study used information from a random sample of one million persons enrolled in the nationally representative Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The GK group consisted of patients who underwent GKRS between 2000 and 2009. The non-GK group was composed of subjects who had never undergone GKRS, but who were matched with the case group for time of enrollment, age, sex, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes., RESULTS: There were 277 patients in the GK group and 2770 matched subjects in the non-GK group. The GK group had a higher overall incidence of cataracts (10.11% vs. 7.26%; crude hazard ratio [cHR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.36; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25; 95% CI, 0.82-1.90) than the non-GK group. Patients who had undergone computed tomography and/or cerebral angiography (CT/angio) studies had a higher risk of developing cataracts than those who did not (10.82% vs. 6.64%; cHR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.31-2.30; aHR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.22-2.23). The age group between 30 and 50 years had the highest risk of cataractogenesis in both the GK and CT/angio groups (cHR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.58-7.72; aHR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.02-5.81; cHR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.47-5.99; aHR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.05-4.93, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure due to GKRS and CT/angio study may be independently associated with increased risk of cataractogenesis. We suggest routine dosimetry measurement of eye lens and proper protection for patients with benign lesions during GKRS. Regular follow-up imaging studies should avoid the use of CT/angio, and particular care should be taken in the 30-50-year-old age group, due to their significantly increased risk of cataract formation.",Included
2744,"[Study of nitroblue tetrazolium reduction by granulocytes in workers handling x-ray equipment] In 44 persons (25 women and 15 men), workers handling X-ray equipment in X-ray laboratories the ability was studied of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by neutrophils. The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2. Neutrophil phagocytic activity is weakened in persons working over five years with X-ray equipment.",Included
282,"Isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis by use of 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine-treated cells Irradiated McCoy cells have provided a useful technique for the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis strains, among which are found the etiological agents of trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded
2451,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included
1713,"Clinical and procedural characteristics associated with higher radiation exposure during percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary angiography BACKGROUND: We aim to study the clinical and procedural characteristics associated with higher radiation exposure in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) and coronary angiography., METHODS AND RESULTS: Our present study included all coronary angiography and PCI procedures in 5 PCI centers in the Western part of Sweden, between January 1, 2008, and January 19, 2012. The radiation exposure and clinical data were collected prospectively in these 5 PCI centers in Sweden as part of the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (SCAAR). A prediction model was made for the radiation exposure (dose-area product) expressed in Gy.cm(2). A total of 20 669 procedures were included in the present study, consisting of 9850 PCI and 10 819 coronary angiography procedures. In multivariable analyses, body mass index (beta=1.04; confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.04; P<0.001); history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery (beta=1.32; CI, 1.28-1.32; P<0.001); 2, 3, or 4 treated lesions (2 treated lesions: beta=1.95; CI, 1.84-2.03; P<0.001; 3 treated lesions: beta=2.34; CI, 2.16-2.53; P<0.001; and 4 treated lesions: beta=2.83; CI, 2.53-3.16; P<0.001); and chronic total occlusion lesions (beta=1.39; CI, 1.31-1.48; P<0.001) were associated with the highest radiation exposure. After adjusting for procedural complexity, radial access route was not associated with increased radiation exposure (beta=1.00; CI, 0.98-1.03; P=0.67)., CONCLUSIONS: In the largest study population to assess radiation exposure, we found that high body mass index, history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery, number of treated lesions, and chronic total occlusions were associated with the highest patient radiation exposure.

2915,"Tumorigenicity of human malignant lymphoblasts: comparative study with unmanipulated nude mice, antilymphocyte serum-treated nude mice, and X-irradiated nude mice The ability of unmanipulated, antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated, and X-irradiated nude BALB/c female mice (in their 13th backcross generation) to serve as hosts for 10 human lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as for peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy humans was compared. The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included
3231,"Transfer of perceptual-motor training and the space adaptation syndrome Perceptual cue conflict may be the basis for the symptoms which are experienced by space travelers in microgravity conditions. Recovery has been suggested to take place after perceptual modification or reinterpretation. To elucidate this process, 10 subjects who repeatedly experienced a visual/vestibular conflict (Purkinje) over trials and days, were then tested in a similar but not identical perceptual situation (pseudo-Coriolis) to determine whether any savings in perceptual adaptation had occurred as compared to an unpracticed control group (N = 10). The practiced subjects experienced lessening dizziness and ataxia within and over sessions. Their response to the new perceptual situation was markedly less than the control group (p less than 0.001). Assessment of ""adaptability,"" in addition to the provocative vestibular tests now in use, may improve prediction of susceptibility to the space adaptation syndrome. An adaptability trait may exist in humans which, properly measured, could be used to predict who would adapt more readily to visual/vestibular conflict and perhaps to environmental stressors in general.",Excluded
1305,"ID: 3522009 NON-RADIATION EUS-BASED ERCP FOR CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS Background: ERCP inherently involves ionizing radiation exposure to the patient and operating staff. Non-radiation EUS-based ERCP was developed and previously reported by our group. We assessed the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of non-radiation ERCP in consecutive patients with choledocholithiasis. Method(s): Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients treated by non-radiation -ERCP over a 33-month period (February 2018 to November 2020). Exclusion criteria: Surgically altered anatomy. Prior to ERCP, EUS with a standard echoendoscope was performed to document the presence, number, and size of stones. The echoendoscope was exchanged for a duodenoscope. Free-hand deep cannulation with an ultra-tapered tip sphincterotome was performed without fluoroscopy. Bile duct access was verified by visible bile aspiration. Aspiration of clear fluid indicated pancreatic duct (PD) cannulation. Precut was performed if the PD was cannulated 3 times. For stone extraction, a sphincterotomy length tailored to stone size was performed using pure cutting current. Stone(s) were removed using a 22mm Dormia basket. Clearance was confirmed by water irrigation method (water ""gush"") with optional cholangioscopy. The number of stones extracted was matched to the number seen on EUS. Result(s): Non-radiation ERCP was performed in 55 consecutive patients (69.10+17.56yrs, 20M:35F) by a single operator (KFB). Bile duct cannulation was successful in all (100%). Precut was performed in 9 patients. Complete stone removal was achieved in all. Procedural time was 24+23 min with 100% technical success. Follow up was 39 + 24 weeks in 35 patients: 35 had no adverse events and remained asymptomatic (1 patient deceased at 8 weeks post procedure). Follow-up incomplete in 20 patients. Limitation(s): Single center, single operator, retrospective study Conclusion(s): EUS-based ERCP for choledocholithiasis was technically feasible and successful in all consecutive patients and without adverse events in patients with follow-up.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
1005,"Initial evaluation of safety of wide-field irradiation in the treatment of hematopoietic neoplasia in the cat Localized radiation therapy is well tolerated in cats with confined tumors; however, the use of wide-field radiation therapy to treat disseminated neoplasia has not been evaluated systematically in this species. Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected. In summary, wide-field external beam radiation therapy can be administered safely to, and may provide therapeutic benefit for, cats with disseminated hematopoietic neoplasia. © 2010 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.",Included

A total of 80 patients with unresectable HCC treated in the First People's Hospital of Qinhuangdao from March 2009 to March 2015 were randomly divided into TACE group (n=40) and TACE + RT group (n=40). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of p53 in both groups before and after treatment. The biochemical indexes of liver function [alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)] were detected. Moreover, adverse reactions were compared between the two groups of patients, the short-term therapeutic effect was evaluated, and effects of two treatment methods on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were detected. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical data between the two groups of patients (P>0.05). The p53 protein levels were significantly downregulated in both treatment methods, and it was decreased more significantly in TACE + RT group than that in TACE group (P<0.05). Compared with those before treatment, AFP and GGT levels in both groups of patients after treatment were decreased, but the levels of ALT were increased (P<0.05), and TACE + RT group had a better curative effect than TACE group (P<0.05). Besides, the incidence rate of adverse reactions in TACE + RT group (37.5%) was obviously lower than that in TACE group (65%) (P<0.05). The number of patients with stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) and disease control rate (DCR) in TACE + RT group were superior to those in TACE group (P<0.05). The 2-year survival rate and median PFS of patients in TACE + RT group were also significantly better than those in TACE group (P<0.05).

A new iterative reconstruction algorithm (flash 3D) has been recently proposed for (SPECT). The aim of work was to evaluate radiation exposure to practitioners and patients by reliance on reconstructions methods that aid in reducing the injected dose Methods: Forty-eight patients (30 M, 18F) who were referred to our department forMPI were randomly selected and divided into 3 groups: Group (1): contained two sub-groups, one scanned with full administrated dose (25+/-3.2 mCi) and half dose (10 +/-2.5mci) Group (2): contained two sub-groups, one scanned with 32 projections per scan, the other with 16 projections per scan. Group (3): contained two sub-groups, one scanned at a time per projection of 20 s and the other scanned at 10 s per projection. The three groups were processed using 3D reconstruction algorithm(flash 3 D) (4 subsets, 13 iterations, FWHM=14 mm). Dose rate was recorded using a calibrated standard survey meter for all patients after dose administration. Besides, Dose calculations were also considered the time elapsed during staff exposure that included dose prepration, injection, patient imaging, and release times. Myocardial functional parameters such as Ejection Fraction (EF), End Diastole Volume (EDV), End Systole Volume (ESV) and Total Perfusion Defect (TPD) were compared for each group. Result(s): Qualitative assessments results from all groups showed which include (full dose (25+/-3.2mci) and half dose (10+/-2.5mci), one scanned with 32 projections per scan, the other with 16 projections per scan and a time per projection of 20 s and the other scanned at 10 s per projection Images were visually scored as very-good quality and sufficiently convergent and identical. Quantitative results using ( 3D) showed insignificant difference of the EF, EDV, ESV and TPD between the different groups. Dose rate reduced by 48%. when reducing to half dose (dose rate was 33+/-4.5 reduced to 14.8+/-3.6 along one meter from patient, also dose rate was reduced from 120+/-5.6 muSv/h to 67 +/-3.9.6 muSv/h in patients' rest room) for that reason the effective dose 15.2 +/- 2.4 was reduced to 7.1 +/- 1.8 when using half protocols with 3D . Conclusion(s): New 3D enable reduction of dose administration or total acquisition time plays a significant role in staff exposure. Further investigations can be performed to assess these results on large patients cohort with further dose reduction.",Excluded

However, the main causes of failure of this therapy are relapse and toxicity. In order to selectively deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the bone marrow and to spare normal organs, we explored 52Fe therapy before a conventional BMT conditioning regimen. Twenty-four patients at high risk for relapse after BMT were included in a phase II study. The median follow-up was 42 months. The median 52Fe dose was 59 mCi. This resulted in a median radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) to the BM of 626 rad. The median RAD to the liver was 338 rad. No untoward effects were noted after the injections of 52Fe. The patients recovered hematopoiesis without toxicity in excess of that expected with conventional conditioning alone. The 3-year DFS probability was 49% (95% CI: 20-78%), Eight patients have relapsed,three of them in extramedullary sites. 52Fe should provide a way to boost the radiation dose to marrow-based diseases before bone marrow transplantation without excessive toxicity.",Excluded
1221,"Characterization of neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius pars centralis Esophageal sensory afferent inputs terminate principally in the central subnucleus of the tractus solitarius (cNTS). Neurons of the cNTS comprise two major neurochemical subpopulations. One contains neurons that are nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactive (-IR) while the other comprises neurons that are tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-IR. We have shown recently that TH-IR neurons are involved in esophageal-distention induced gastric relaxation. We used whole cell patch clamp techniques in rat brainstem slices combined with immunohistochemical and morphological reconstructions to characterize cNTS neurons. Postrecording reconstruction of cNTS neurons revealed two morphological neuronal subtypes; one group of cells (41 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 31%) had a multipolar soma, while the other group (87 out of 131 neurons, i.e., 66%) had a bipolar soma. Of the 43 cells in which we conducted a neurochemical examination, 15 displayed TH-IR (9 with bipolar morphology, 6 with multipolar morphology) while the remaining 28 neurons did not display TH-IR (18 with bipolar morphology, 10 with multipolar morphology). Even though the range of electrophysiological properties varied significantly, morphological or neurochemical distinctions did not reveal characteristics peculiar to the subgroups. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) recorded in cNTS neurons had a frequency of 1.5 +/- 0.15 events s(-1) and an amplitude of 27 +/- 1.2 pA (Vh = -50 mV) and were abolished by pretreatment with 30 muM AP-5 and 10 muM CNQX, indicating the involvement of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Some cNTS neurons also received a GABAergic input that was abolished by perfusion with 30-50 muM bicuculline.

In this study, we aim to retrospectively evaluate the effectiveness of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous infiltration in a series of consecutive PS patients who have symptoms that are refractory to conservative therapies. An institutional database search identified 20 such consecutive patients who underwent infiltration with a mixture of long-acting corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Preoperational evaluation included physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. The correct position of the 22-gauge spinal needle was verified with CT scan after contrast medium injection. Pain measured before the procedure and at 1 wk and 1, 6, and 12 mo after the procedure was compared by means of a numeric visual scale (NVS) questionnaire. The mean pain score before CT-guided percutaneous infiltration was 8.95 +/- 1.432 NVS units. This score was reduced to a mean value of 0.85 +/- 0.933 units at 1 wk, 0.90 +/- 0.852 at 1 mo, 1.10 +/- 1.165 at 6 mo, and 1.20 +/- 1.399 at 12 mo follow-up (p < 0.001).

Assessment of life quality and accelerated biological aging of accident liquidators] In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered.

2568,"Technological Advances in Arrhythmia Management Applied to Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease. Numerous challenges to managing arrhythmias include vascular access issues, intracardiac shunts, unconventional locations of the conduction system, and anatomical complexities. Technological advances are improving our ability to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. Implantable loop recorders and various technologies developed for consumers to record electrocardiographic tracings using smartphone applications, watches, and dedicated portable devices are expanding our armamentarium of diagnostic tools. Remote magnetic-guided catheter ablation is enhancing access to otherwise difficult to reach arrhythmia substrates. Cryoablation allows perinodal arrhythmias to be safely treated in patients with displaced or difficult to predict locations of the atrioventricular conduction system. Interventions that minimize radiation exposure to near 0 levels are gaining interest and pulmonary vein isolation procedures to treat atrial fibrillation are increasingly performed. Cardiac implantable electronic devices compatible with magnetic resonance imaging have become the norm. Subcutaneous defibrillators and leadless pacemakers are providing effective solutions to patients in whom transvenous leads are contraindicated or not desired. His-bundle pacing is emerging as a viable option to provide more physiological pacing. Progressive advances in multicomponent communicating leadless devices carry the promise of providing leadless dual chamber pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the near future. The safety of transvenous lead extraction procedures is likely to improve with advances such as the low-pressure balloon to manage superior vena cava lacerations. Awareness of these developments and referral to sites with dedicated expertise could contribute to further improving outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

Volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), dose length product (DLP), background noise (BN), attenuation values, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), scan time, effective tube current-time product (eff. mAs), subjective diagnostic image quality and artifact burden were compared., RESULTS: CTDIvol (5.5 +/- 0.8 mGy vs. 12.4 +/- 1.4 mGy), DLP (172 +/- 27 mGycm vs. 344 +/- 60 mGycm, p<0.0001), eff. mAs (98 +/- 15 mAs vs. 183 +/- 20 mAs, p<0.0001) and scan time (0.64 +/- 0.05 s vs. 8.21 +/- 0.72 s) were lower for group 1. BN was higher (p<0.001) for group 1 with a mean difference of 2.6 HU. SNR for sternocleidomastoid and pectoral muscle was lower (6.6-12.3 vs. 7.8-19.1) for group 1. Subjective image quality (1.55 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.42 +/- 0.5) and artifact burden (1.62 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.57 +/- 0.9) were not rated significantly different (p=0.47 and p=0.80) with a good inter-observer agreement (kappa=0.59-0.90)., CONCLUSION: High-pitch DSCT allows reduction of patient dose for cervical lymphoma staging while diagnostic image quality is preserved.

309,"Treatment outcomes of T4 locally advanced head and neck cancers with soft tissue invasion or bone and cartilage invasion PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S):: T4 locally advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) with bone and cartilage invasion (BCI) traditionally have been treated with resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

357,"Dynamic change of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease PURPOSE: To evaluate the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease (DED) by using a double-pass system., METHODS: Fifty-six patients with DED and 35 control subjects were included in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford scale), and Schirmer I test. Using the tear film analysis program of the Optical Quality Analysis System, we recorded the objective scatter index (OSI) every 0.5 seconds within a 20-second period with the subjects asked to blink freely. Several parameters were established to evaluate the dynamic alterations of optical quality and the effects of blinks: OSI standard deviation (SD), DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, blinking change (BC), blinking frequency (BF), and tolerant limitation (TL)., RESULTS: Patients with DED had significant alterations of optical quality compared to control subjects. The DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, BC, and BF were significantly higher and TL was significantly lower in DED patients than controls. Furthermore, the DELTAOSI and DELTAOSI/time were also significantly higher in patients with severe DED than patients with mild disease. In univariate analysis, both TBUT and corneal staining were correlated with DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, and BC. In multivariate analysis, DELTAOSI/time was correlated to the corneal staining score., CONCLUSIONS: The double-pass system allowed the monitoring of the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with DED. Optical quality should be evaluated in patients with DED because these alterations cannot be determined from the classical DED clinical tests.",Excluded
1077,"Impact of vitamin D correction on circulating irisin: A 12 month interventional study Irisin, a novel myokine secreted by skeletal muscle, promotes browning of white fat and influences glucose and energy homeostasis. Irisin and vitamin D are also known for their roles in the musculoskeletal system. In this study, we examined the impact of vitamin D correction on circulating irisin in Saudi subjects. For this, vitamin D deficient subjects (<=50 nmol/l) were advised to receive adequate sunlight, eat vitamin D enriched foods and retain normal physical activity for correction/improvement in vitamin D status. Seventy-eight (30 male and 48 female) subjects, who responded to vitamin D intervention, were selected for further analyses. Anthropometry and routine biochemical assay were performed. Serum 25 (OH) D was analyzed using electrochemiluminiscence. Irisin levels were analyzed at baseline and after 12-month of intervention. Serum 25 (OH) D levels were significantly increased at post-intervention compared to baseline value (51.0+/-4.0 vs. 27.8+/-2.3 in males and 69.1+/-4.5 vs. 27.1+/-1.8 in females). With an increase in the levels of vitamin D adjusted for age and BMI, a corresponding increase in irisin level was observed in males (P=0.026) and to a lesser extent in females (P=0.093). Thus, vitamin D correction had a significant impact on irisin levels in male Saudi subjects but in females it failed to reach at significance. Further studies are needed in other ethnic population to better understand the influence of vitamin D on irisin regulation and secretion.Copyright © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

978,"Management of mandibular osteoradionecrosis corresponding to the severity of osteoradionecrosis and the method of radiotherapy PURPOSE: : To demonstrate appropriate treatment methods for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) by evaluating previous results., METHODS: : The relationship between the time interval after radiation therapy (RT) and the severity of ORN was examined. Eighty-seven patients were classified according to the extent of the lesion (grades), and the cure rates were calculated according to the RT modality, the grade, and the treatment method for ORN., RESULTS: : The later ORN developed and the higher the dose of irradiation, particularly among the patients who received external RT, the more it progressed. The initial cure rates for conservative management, marginal, and segmental mandibulectomy were 39.7%, 50%, and 86.7%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: : Conservative management should be limited to early-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without a low dose of external irradiation. Marginal mandibulectomy is appropriate for the late-onset ORN after brachytherapy with or without low-dose external irradiation. Segmental mandibulectomy is required for late-onset ORN after a high dose of external irradiation. Copyright 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 25: 181-186, 2003",Excluded

1128,"Irradiated laboratory animal diets: dominant lethal studies in the mouse In 4 separate dominant lethal experiments groups of mice of either Charles River CD1 or Alderley Park strains were fed laboratory diets (Oakes, 41B, PRD, BP nutrition rat and mouse maintenance diet No. 1). The diets were either untreated (negative control diets) or irradiated at 1, 2.5 and 5 megarad and were freshly irradiated, or stored. The animals were fed their test diets for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. Groups of mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg cyclophosphamide per kg body weight served as the positive controls. Freshly irradiated PRD diet fed to male mice of both strains caused an increase in early deaths in females mated to the males in week 7 and to a lesser extent in week 4. The increase due to irradiation was small by comparison with that produced by the positive control compound. The responses for the other irradiated diets showed no significant increases in early deaths although some values for Oakes diet were high. The effect of storage was examined with PRD and BPN diet on one occasion and produced conflicting results. Thus there was some evidence that irradiated PRD diet has weak mutagenic activity in the meiotic and/or pre-meiotic phase of the spermatogenic cycle which appeared to be lessened on storage; the inclusion of such a diet in toxicological studies would therefore need to be carefully considered.",Excluded
2616,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences., METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system., RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded

Breakpoint distribution in induced chromosome aberrations A total of 660 breakpoints were identified in the chromosome aberrations detected in lymphocytes from cancer patients after radiotherapy. The results show that chromosomes 1, 3, and 7 were significantly more affected than other chromosomes by ionizing radiation in vivo. Chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 7q, and 11p were also significantly more affected. Some bands also showed a special sensitivity to radiation, and band 1q32 was the most affected. This band is proposed as a hot point"" for the clastogenic effect of ionizing radiation. A significant clustering of breakpoints in G bands was also found, especially at the telomeres, as previously described by other authors. Clustering of breakpoints was also observed in bands where fragile sites, protooncogenes, breakpoints involved in chromosomal cancer rearrangements, and breakpoints involved in chromosomal evolution of the Hominoidea are located.""",Included
1968,"Correlation between hallux valgus angle and hallucal sesamoid position on meary radiographic incide Background: Hallux valgus (HV) and sesamoid misalignment are usually linked. Some studies found no correlation between the stage of hallucal sesamoid subluxation and standard radiographic data usually used for quantifying the severity of the HV. Aim(s): This study evaluate the correlation between the apparent lateral deviation of the sesamoids on anteroposterior X-rays and their rotation on axial X-rays, then evaluates their relations with the severity of hallux valgus. Method(s): This monocentric retrospective study included feet of adult men and women with a HV angle (HVA) superior to 15 degrees. Two independent doctors made the measurement of the relative displacement of the sesamoids on anteroposterior radiographies by using the 7 grades Clapham-and-Hardy classification and compared it with their rotation in axial radiographies, defined by the sesamoid rotation angle and the tibia sesamoid grade on modified Meary incidence with radio-transparent heelpiece. Correlation with the HV severity was analyzed based on measure of HVA and first intermetatarsal angle. Result(s): 303 feet were included (201 patients). All parameters shown significant correlations between each other. SRA appeared to be the most reliable criteria on Me ary radiography to evaluate the relative lateral displacement of sesamoids and it was the most strongly correlated to the HVA (0.658). Conclusion(s): An anteroposterior radiographic incidence is not sufficient to evaluate sesamoids subluxation. To approach at best the triplanar deformity of the metatarso-sesamoid complex, an evaluation in frontal and axial incidence is necessary. SRA appears as reliable criteria and could be used to evaluate the quality of the corrective surgery.",Excluded
87,"The QUANTEC criteria for parotid gland dose and their efficacy to prevent moderate to severe patient-rated xerostomia Background. Recently, the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) Group defined dose-volume constraints for the parotid glands to avoid severe xerostomia. The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. Material and methods. The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk. Results. In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met. Conclusions. Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
777,"Predictors of Late Cardiovascular Complications in Survivors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Long-term survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is now an expected outcome. The growing population of survivors is at risk of developing treatment-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). A nested case-controlled design was used to identify clinical and treatment-related risk factors for development of late (1+ years after HCT) CVD. Cases were identified from a cohort of 1+-year survivors who underwent transplantation at City of Hope between 1977 and 2006. Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded
2883,"Comparison of Postoperative Outcomes According to Compensatory Changes of the Thoracic Spine among Patients with a T1 Slope More Than 40degree Study Design.Retrospective study of postoperative outcomes of adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery.Objective.To clarify the differences in postoperative outcomes depending on the presence or absence of thoracic compensatory changes among patients with a T1 slope (TS) more than 40degree.Summary of Background Data.Loss correction after ASD surgery is more likely to occur when preoperative TS is more than 40degree. When preoperative TS is more than 40degree, some cases involve compensatory changes in the thoracic spine and decreased thoracic kyphosis (TK); others involve increased TK without compensatory changes.Methods.Seventy-nine patients with TS more than 40degree who underwent ASD surgery were enrolled and separated into compensated and noncompensated groups (group C: TK <40degree; group NC: TK >=40degree). Radiographic parameters obtained by whole-spine standing x-ray, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Scoliosis Research Society-22 (SRS-22) questionnaire were assessed.Results.There were 41 patients in group C and 38 patients in group NC. Preoperative significant differences in TS did not disappear after surgery (preoperative TS: group C and group NC=46degree and 55degree, P<0.001; just after surgery: group C and group NC=27degree and 40degree, P<0.001; 2 years later: group C and group NC=34degree and 47degree, P<0.001). There were no significant differences in ODI and all domains of the SRS-22 before surgery. However, 2 years after the surgery, ODI (38%), pain (3.5), self-image (3.0), and total (3.2) values of the SRS-22 for group NC were significantly worse than those (28%, 4.0, 3.4, and 3.5, respectively) for group C (P<0.05).Conclusion.Changes in the thoracic spine (TS and TK >40degree) result in poor postoperative outcomes. Extending the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) to the upper thoracic spine must be considered. Even when TS is more than 40degree, TK less than 40degree, and upper instrumented vertebra set to the lower thoracic level result in good postoperative outcomes.

From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Ageing leads to decrease of cathepsins activity in rat liver lysosomal fractions. Constant light and darkness conditions result in earlier age decline of cathepsins activity. Absence of day and night succession in comparison with alternating light conditions causes decline of both general and specific cathepsin D activity. Melatonin and epithalon administration resulted in decrease of cathepsin D activity in liver only under control interchangeable light conditions. Cathepsin B activity in liver and kidneys lysosomal fractions declined in all experimental light conditions. Cathepsins activity decrease under the influence of epiphysial factors is evidently connected with their inhibitory effect on protein and general metabolism.",Excluded
192,"Apparent migration of implantable port devices: normal variations in consideration of BMI PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded
1869,"Fasciculation-myokymic activity and prolonged nerve conduction block. A physiopathological relationship in radiation-induced brachial plexopathy Fourteen radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathies in 12 patients suffering from cancer were studied. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a diffuse neurogenic lesion with muscular denervation signs associated with motor and sensory nerve conduction impairment of axonal type in the distal segments of the arm. Somatosensory evoked potentials were frequently abnormal, with absence of N9 in 9 out of the 10 extremities explored. The most characteristic findings were, however, the presence of fasciculation potentials--single and grouped--and myokymic discharges in 78.5% of cases (11 out of 14 plexuses), and a motor nerve conduction block on proximal stimulation, at the supraclavicular as well as cervical spine levels, in all of the cases. Both phenomena showed a high correlation when analyzed in the same neuromuscular territory. The 5 muscles with no voluntary activity and complete--or nearly complete--motor nerve conduction block were the ones with the most intense ectopic activities. The conduction blocks were present after long periods of illness in all cases and, in 2 of the cases, they persisted in successive explorations at intervals of 9 months and 2 years respectively. These data would support a probable cause-effect relationship between a persistent and prolonged motor nerve conduction block and the presence of fasciculation-myokymic type activities. One could even postulate that the infrequent neuropathies, in which both findings have been described as relevant features, have a similar physiopathological mechanism.",Excluded
2328,"Retrograde nailing arthrodesis in distal leg deformities Introduction Distal leg and ankle deformities lead to progressive degeneration of the distal tibia and astragalic articular surfaces. When the cartilagineous degeneration is severe, or it is not possible to surgically correct the bone deformity, arthrodesis is the only surgical operation that is able to restore functionality. Retrograde nailing is a stable synthesis that leads to rapid healing of the bone surfaces, and precocious recovery. We assessed its application in articular distal tibia and ankle axial deviations. Methods Between 2007 and 2012 we studied a group of 25 patients, 14 women and 11 men, mean age 43 years (min 31, max 74), affected by distal leg and ankle deformities.We divided them in 2 groups depending on the deformity site (tibia 11 patients, talus bone 14 patients). We assessed the surgical access, the corrective osteotomy site, the cancellous bone graft, the healing time through a modified AOFAS score and X-rays, with a 3 years follow-up. Weight bearing was allowed 35 days post-operatively. The bone graft was harvested through peroneal malleolus resection, with the same lateral surgical access. Results In all patients we achieved deformity correction. Bone consolidation occurred in 90 days. Nailing and preparation of the articular surfaces was associated to subtractive osteotomies in 9 cases. Five tibial osteotomies were performed mostly in post-traumatic deformities, 4 talus osteotomies mostly in degenerative deformities. A thin layer of cancellous bone graft was used 18 patients. Mean preoperative AOFAS score was 37. At the 12-month follow-up, the score increased to 80, and it was maintained in the following examinations. Discussion Retrograde nailing tibiotarsic arthrodesis with osteotomies is able to correct complex deformities with severe articular damage. Nailing makes this treatment more tolerable for patients comparing to techniques such as external fixation. Subtractive osteotomies or subtalar joint re-alignment are necessary in cases of severe rear foot deformities that prevent nail insertion. Conclusions Retrograde nailing arthrodesis allows a complete correction of distal tibia and ankle articular deformities, a rapid consolidation and a precocious functional recovery.",Excluded

2520,"Low-dose radiotherapy for lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa Purpose: There is no agreement within the radiation oncology and ophthalmic communities regarding the treatment of lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. The authors report their experience with the use of low-dose radiation therapy for malignant and benign lymphoid masses of the orbital region in a series of 54 patients treated between 1985 and 1993. Method(s): All patients received 2 Gy per day for a total of 24 Gy, except when the lesion was extensive, in which case the therapy was 1.5 Gy per day for a total of 25.5 Gy. A diagnosis was established by incisional surgical biopsy in 26 patients and aspiration cytology in 28 patients. Those with a malignant or an indeterminate diagnosis were evaluated with a modified Ann Arbor staging system. Result(s): Low-dose radiation therapy produced a complete response in 100% of the orbital lymphoid lesions. This local control was maintained in 52 patients (96%) for the first year and in 51 patients (95%) for 5 or more years with a mean follow-up of 7 years. One patient died of causes unrelated to the malignant lymphoma after the first year of observation. The mean age of the 54 patients was 67 years, and the range was 37 to 90 years. The mean ages of presentation for each location were: orbit, 67 years; conjunctiva, 68 years; lacrimal gland, 66 years; and eyelids, 72 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25:1 (34 women and 20 men). In this series, 9 patients had benign processes, 38 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 patients had abnormalities of indeterminate cause. All histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the orbit responded equally well to therapy. Forty-five patients had clinically staged disease as follows: stage I, 21 patients; stage II, 4 patients; stage III, 2 patients; and stage IV, 18 patients. Benign disease, diagnosed in 9 patients, was not staged. Conclusion(s): Low-dose radiation therapy proved effective in treating lymphoid lesions of the orbital area. No treatment-limiting complications occurred. The only early side effects were mild xerophthalmia and chemosis in 50% of patients, and the only chronic side effect was mild xerophthalmia in 33% of patients. Cataracts, corneal ulcerations, and retinal injury were not observed.",Excluded
781,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included
2367,"The features of bone metabolism in patients with periodontal diseases Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women). BAP show significant differences between groups. The level of DPD in the GP group (5.78+/-0.79 mmol in men, 8.34+/-0.56 mmol in women) was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to HPS group (3.57+/-1.12 mmol in men, 4.47+/-0.76 mmol in women). Conclusions These results suggest that periodontitis associations with bone metabolic disturbances. In patients with periodontitis unbalanced bone remodeling was found: decreased bone formation and increased resorption.",Excluded
306,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT. The present study in an unselected population including patients with atrial fibrillation demonstrates that 320-row CT may significantly reduce the radiation dose and amount of contrast agent required compared with ICA while maintaining a very high diagnostic accuracy.",Excluded
2949,"Adjuvant Radiation and Chemoradiation for High-Risk Salivary Gland Malignancies: A 20-Year Single Institution Experience Purpose/Objective(s): To report our institutional outcomes of patients with non-previously treated, high-risk salivary gland malignancies treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiation (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT). Materials/Methods: From January 1997 to December 2017, 108 patients were treated with surgery, and adjuvant RT (n = 50) or CRT (n = 58) for high-risk pathologic features: perineural involvement (PNI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive/close (<2mm) margin, high grade, extracapsular extension (ECE), or positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant RT was delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions, and adjuvant CRT was delivered for 4-6 alternating week cycles: the most common regimen, TFHX, consisted of 5 days paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 on d1), infusional 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d x 5d), hydroxyurea (500 mg PO BID), and 1.5 Gy twice daily irradiation followed by a 9-day break without treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate rates of locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with LRC, DFS, and OS. Multivariable Cox Regression (MVA) was performed for known confounding risk factors, and factors associated with a trend to significance (p <0.20). Chi-Square was used to compare rates of toxicities between groups. Result(s): Median follow-up was 52 months (range: 3 - 226). The most common histologies included: Adenoid Cystic (n = 30), Mucoepidermoid (n = 20), and Salivary Duct Adenocarcinoma (n = 18). The most common location included the parotid (n = 73). The median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 43.2 - 74 Gy). The 5-year LRC was 88%, 5-year DFS was 57%, and 5-year OS was 78%. On MVA, LRC was not associated with any factors; DFS was associated with the size of the tumor (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), tumor location (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), and stage (HR 1.7, p = 0.02); and OS was associated with N stage (HR 2.3, p = 0.005), LVSI (HR 1.9, p = 0.012), ECE (HR 1.5, p = 0.032), and stage (HR 1.3, p = 0.05). CRT was not associated with improved LRC (HR 0.5, p = 0.34), DFS (HR 0.4, p = 0.44), or OS (HR: 0.46, p = 0.384). Since 87% of node positive patients were treated with adjuvant CRT compared to 13% with RT, therefore comparison was not possible. There was no difference in any acute or late grade 3+ toxicities, or parenteral nutrition between RT and CRT (p = 0.98, p = 0.85, and p = 0.83), respectively. There was one acute grade 5 toxicity in the RT group. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the largest single institution cohort of adjuvant CRT for high-risk salivary malignancies. Overall, adjuvant CRT doesn't enhance outcomes compared to adjuvant RT alone. However, LRC was similar between RT and CRT groups in spite of more adverse features (nodal disease and ECE) in the CRT group. Distant metastatic disease remains a significant pattern of failure. We await large prospective evidence to determine which subsets of patients benefit from adjuvant CRT.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
1560,"Dual-source abdominopelvic computed tomography: Comparison of image quality and radiation dose of 80 kVp and 80/150 kVp with tin filter OBJECTIVE: To compare the radiation dose and the objective and subjective image quality of 80 kVp and 80/150 kVp with tin filter (80/Sn150 kVp) computed tomography (CT) in oncology patients., METHODS: One-hundred-and-forty-five consecutive oncology patients who underwent third-generation dual-source dual-energy CT of the abdomen for evaluation of malignant visceral, peritoneal, extraperitoneal, and bone tumor were retrospectively recruited. Two radiologists independently reviewed each observation in 80 kVp CT and 80/Sn150 kVp CT. Modified line-density profile of the tumor and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. Diagnostic confidence, lesion conspicuity, and subjective image quality were calculated and compared between image sets. The effective dose and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) were calculated in the image sets., RESULTS: Modified line-density profile analysis revealed higher attenuation differences between the tumor and normal tissue in 80 kVp CT than in 80/Sn150 kVp CT (127 vs. 107, P = 0.05). The 80 kVp CT showed increased CNR in the liver (8.0 vs. 7.6) and the aorta (18.9 vs. 16.3) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT. The 80 kVp CT yielded higher enhancement of organs (4.9 +/- 0.2 vs. 4.7 +/- 0.4, P<0.001) and lesion conspicuity (4.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 0.5, P = 0.035) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT; overall image quality and confidence index were comparable. The effective dose was reduced by 45.2% with 80 kVp CT (2.3 mSv +/- 0.9) compared to 80/Sn150 kVp CT (4.1 mSv +/- 1.5). The SSDE was 7.4 +/- 3.8 mGy on 80/Sn150 kVp CT and 4.1 +/- 2.2 mGy on 80 kVp CT., CONCLUSIONS: The 80 kVp CT reduced the radiation dose by 45.2% in oncology patients while showing comparable or superior image quality to that of 80/Sn150 kVp CT for abdominal tumor evaluation.",Excluded
2874,"A non-invasive citogenetic biomarker for colorectal neoplastia prediction INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to identify a feasible, non-invasive method to predict the presence of significant colorectal neoplastic lesions in patients undergoing colonoscopy. AIMS&METHODS: We included patients about to have colonoscopy in our departments between January 2011 and March 2012. Patients with known neoplastic disease, inflammatory bowel disease or prior radiation exposure were excluded. Blood samples for cytogenetic analysis using Cytogenetic-Bloked Micronucleus Assay (CBMN) technique were taken from patients. An expression of lymphocytic proliferation in specific stimulated cultures - the Nuclear Division Index (NDI) - was calculated trough this method. NDI represents a measure of general cytotoxicity. For statistics we used SPSS 11.0 software. RESULT(S): 94 patients were included. Their mean age was 55.1 years, men and women were equally represented, 47 each (50%). There were: 37 patients with normal colonoscopy, 4 patients with hyperplastic polyps, 30 patients with adenomas (from these 9 were advanced: size over 10mm, with high grade dysplasia or with a villous component larger than 25%), 23 patients with colorectal cancer. NDI was significantly lower in patients with adenomas and cancer than in patients with normal colonoscopy or hyperplastic polyps (AUC ROC = 0.637, p = 0.036). Secondly, NDI was also significantly lower in patients with advanced adenomas or cancer than in patients with normal colonoscopy, hyperplastic polyps or non-advanced adenomas (AUC ROC = 0.0677, p = 0.005). Finally, patients with colorectal cancer had a significantly lower NDI than patients with no colorectal cancer (AUC ROC = 0.655, p= 0.026). CONCLUSION(S): A lower Nuclear Division Index calculate by CBMN technique may predict the presence of significant colonic lesions in a population undergoing colonoscopy.",Excluded

2016,"Investigation of sinonasal anatomy via low-dose multidetector CT examination in chronic rhinosinusitis patients with higher risk for perioperative complications The aim of the study was to compare visualisation of the surgically relevant anatomical structures via low- and standard-dose multidetector CT protocol in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and higher risk for perioperative complications (i.e. presence of bronchial asthma, history of sinus surgery and advanced nasal polyposis). 135 adult CRS patients were divided randomly into standard-dose (120 kVp, 100 mAs) or low-dose CT groups (120 kVp, 45 mAs). The detectability of the vital anatomical structures (anterior ethmoid artery, optic nerve, cribriform plate and lamina papyracea) was scored using a five-point scale (from excellent to unacceptable) by a radiologist and sinus surgeon. Polyp sizes were quantified endoscopically according to the Lildholdt's scale (LS). Olfactory function was tested with the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test. On the low-dose CT images, detectability ranged from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic cases to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps. Identification of lamina papyracea on low-dose scans was significantly worse in each group and the same was the case with cribriform plates in patients with advanced polyposis and anosmia. Cribriform plates were the most poorly identified (between poor and average) among all the structures on low-dose images. Identification of anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) with reduced dose was insignificantly worse than with standard-dose examination. The AEA was scored as an average-defined structure and was the second weakest visualised. In conclusion, preoperatively, low-dose protocols may not sufficiently visualise the surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with CRS and bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps (LS > 2) and history of sinus surgery. Low mAs value enables comparable detectability of sinonasal landmarks with standard-dose protocols in patients without analysed risk factors. In the context of planned surgery, the current preferences of the tube should be carefully evaluated for different patient constitutions to minimise the risk of complications.",Excluded
2436,"Opaque intraocular lens for intractable diplopia: experience and patients' expectations and satisfaction AIM: To report the authors' experience with the use of opaque intraocular lenses (IOL) in diplopia unresponsive to traditional management strategies, and to assess patients' satisfaction and the visual function of patients following insertion of opaque IOL using the Visual Function Index (VF-14)., SETTINGS: Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK., METHOD: Data were obtained on all patients who underwent insertion of an opaque IOL at our institution between 2002 and 2006. Patients were interviewed by telephone. Any visual function impairment was assessed using the VF-14 questionnaire. Patients were also asked to score subjectively their overall satisfaction with the visual outcome after opaque IOL insertion., RESULTS: The authors studied 12 patients (n = 12) who had insertion of opaque IOL. All patients had constant and persistent diplopia unresponsive to other treatments acceptable to the patient. The median duration of diplopia was 5.5 years (interquartile range was 2.4-17.3 years). The postoperative VF-14 ranged from 75 to 100, and the mean VF-14 was 91 (95% CI 83-99). Three patients reported a maximum score of 100. Patient satisfaction ranged from 2 to 4, and the average was 3.4 out of 4., CONCLUSIONS: Opaque IOL insertion is a valuable option in the management of intractable diplopia.

1608,"Temozolomide and irradiation combined treatment-induced Nrf2 activation increases chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cells Resistance to chemoradiotherapy is a major obstacle to successful treatment of glioblastoma. Recently, the role of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity has been reported in several types of cancers. Here, we investigated whether temozolomide (TMZ) and irradiation (IR) combined treatment induced Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. And we further performed a preliminary study about the effect of Nrf2 on chemoradiation sensitivity. Immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 in paired clinical specimens showed that TMZ and IR combined treatment increased the expression and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in human glioblastoma tissues. Moreover, we found nuclear Nrf2 expression in the glioblastoma tissues obtained from the patients undergoing TMZ and IR combined treatment was associated with the time to tumor recurrence. In vitro, we further verified these findings. First, we detected increased nuclear localization of Nrf2 following treatment with TMZ+IR in human glioblastoma cell lines. Second, we demonstrated TMZ+IR increased the levels of Nrf2 protein in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of U251 cells and induced Nrf2 target genes expression. Finally, downregulating Nrf2 expression increased TMZ+IR-induced cell death in the U251 cells. These findings suggest TMZ+IR combined treatment induces Nrf2 activation in human glioblastoma cells. The activation of Nrf2 may be associate with enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity in human glioblastoma cell. Blocking Nrf2 activation may be a promising method enhancing chemoradiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.",Excluded
654,"Is computed tomography cystography indicated in children with pelvic fractures? Purpose: Pelvic fracture evaluation with abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and formal CT cystography for rule out of urine bladder injury have been commonly employed in pediatric trauma patients. The additional delayed imaging required to obtain optimal CT cystography is, however, associated with increased doses of ionizing radiation to pelvic organs and represent a significant risk in the pediatric population for future carcinogenic risk. We hypothesized that avoidance of routine CT cystography among pediatric pelvic fracture victims would not result in an appreciable rate of missed bladder injuries and would aid in mitigating the radiation exposure risk associated with these additional images. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study involving blunt trauma pelvic fractures among pediatric trauma patients (age<14) between the years 1997 and 2016 was conducted utilizing the Israeli National Trauma Registry. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 via the tests of Chi-square test and two-sided Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 1072 children were identified from the registry for inclusion. Mean age of patients was 7.7 years (range 0-14) and 713 (66.5%) were male. Overall mortality in this population was 4.1% (44/1072). Only 2.1% (23) of pediatric patients with pelvic fractures had bladder injury identified, with just 9 children having intraperitoneal bladder rupture (0.8% of all the patients). Conclusion(s): The vast majority of blunt pediatric trauma victims with pelvic fractures do not have urine bladder injuries. Based on our study results we do not recommend the routine utilization of CT cystography in this unique population. Copyright © 2019 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded
2085,"Spanish translation and psychometric evaluation of the Healthcare Professional Knowledge of Radiation Protection scale The objective of this work was to make an intercultural adaptation and provide a Spanish translation and psychometric evaluation of the original English version of the Healthcare Professional Knowledge of Radiation Protection (HPKRP) scale. The Spanish translation was carried out following international guidelines for the process of cross-cultural adaptation of self-report measures. A cross-sectional design study was carried out. One hundred and thirty-eight nurses from four different hospitals in Barcelona (Spain) completed the Spanish version of the scale. The total score of the scale was calculated. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was used to evaluate a possible correlation between score and years of experience. A t-test for independent samples was used to evaluate significant differences between different groups. Cronbach's alpha, the corrected item-total correlation coefficient and the test-retest coefficient were used to determine internal consistency. The exploratory factor and parallel analysis were also calculated. All statistical tests were carried out with a level of significance alpha = 0.05. The mean scale score was poor among Spanish nurses. The PCC between total score and years of experience showed a non-significant correlation (p > 0.05). No differences were found between nurses who worked in radiation-exposed units and those who worked in units without radiation exposure (p > 0.05). A Cronbach alpha of 0.98 was obtained for the items of the scale. The corrected item-total correlation range was 0.5-0.8. The test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.9. The exploratory analysis factor showed a single factorial structure which explained 60.86% of the variance. The new scale translated into Spanish (Sp-HPKRP) could be used to evaluate the degree of knowledge about radiological protection.",Excluded

The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2427,"Imaging Findings Within the First 12 Months of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Purpose: To correlate the imaging findings of treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with explant pathology and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response. Methods and Materials: From 2007 to 2015, of 146 patients treated with liver SBRT for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma, 10 were identified with inclusion criteria and had regular interval follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/triple phase computed tomography and explant pathology or declining AFP values for radiology-pathology response correlation. Reference standards for successful response were >90% necrosis on explant pathology or pretreatment AFP >75 ng/mL normalizing to <10 ng/mL within 1 year after SBRT without other treatment. Subjects were treated with 24 to 50 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. Multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SBRT was compared with pretreatment imaging by 2 expert radiologists. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): There were 10 subjects with 10 treated HCCs, classified as 3 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 5a, 4 OPTN 5b, and 3 OPTN 5x. All had successfully treated HCCs, according to explant pathology or declining AFP. Four of 10 HCCs had persistent central arterial hyperenhancement 3 to 12 months after SBRT; persistent wash-out was common up to 12 months (9 of 10). Of 10 treated HCCs, 9 exhibited decreased size at 12 months. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion showed early (3-6 months) hyperemia followed by late (6-12 months) capsular retraction and delayed enhancement. No patient had a significant decline in liver function. Conclusion(s): In the absence of increasing size, persistent central arterial hyperenhancement and wash-out can occur within the first 12 months after SBRT in successfully treated HCCs and may not represent residual viable tumor. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the treated lesion showed inflammation followed by fibrosis, without significant change in hepatic function. Until a radiologic signature of tumor control is determined, freedom from local progression seems to be the best measure of HCC control after SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
585,"Delineating chromosomal breakpoints in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancer Recurrent translocations are well known hallmarks of many human solid tumors and hematological disorders, where patient- and breakpoint-specific information may facilitate prognostication and individualized therapy. In thyroid carcinomas, the proto-oncogenes RET and NTRK1 are often found to be activated through chromosomal rearrangements. However, many sporadic tumors and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) arising in patients with a history of exposure to elevated levels of ionizing irradiation do not carry these known abnormalities. We developed a rapid scheme to screen tumor cell metaphase spreads and identify candidate genes of tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression for subsequent functional studies. Using a series of overnight fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with pools comprised of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, it now becomes possible to rapidly refine breakpoint maps and, within one week, progress from the low resolution Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) maps or Giemsa-banding (G-banding) karyotypes to fully integrated, high resolution physical maps including a list of candiate genes in the critical regions. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded

Surprisingly and in contrast to U.V.B.-exposed repair proficient hairless mice who mainly develop squamous cell carcinomas, the XPA-deficient mice developed papillomas with a high frequency (31%) at a U.V. dose of 32 J/m2 daily. At the highest daily dose of 80 J/m2 mainly squamous cell carcinomas (56%) and only 10% of papillomas were found in XPA-deficient hairless mice. p53 gene mutations were examined in exons 5, 7 and 8 and were detected in only 3 out of 37 of these skin tumors, whereas in tumors of control U.V.B.-irradiated wild type littermates this frequency was higher (45%) and more in line with our previous data. Strikingly, a high incidence of activating ras gene mutations were observed in U.V.B.-induced papillomas (in 11 out of 14 tumors analysed). In only two out of 14 squamous cell carcinomas we found similar ras gene mutations. The observed shift from squamous cell carcinomas in wild type hairless mice to papillomas in XPA-deficient hairless mice, and a corresponding shift in mutated cancer genes in these tumors, provide new clues on the pathogenesis of chemically- versus U.V.B.-induced skin carcinogenesis.",Excluded
2547,"Potential benefits and pitfalls of respiratory-gated radiotherapy in the treatment of thoracic malignancy Aim: Despite advances in radiotherapy delivery, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor. Higher doses of radiation have been associated with improved outcomes but may result in higher toxicities. Respiratory gated radiotherapy (RGRT) has the potential to reduce pulmonary toxicity but there are significant limitations and pitfalls to its use. The aim of this article is to (i) describe the RGRT technique currently employed at Nepean and Westmead Hospitals; (ii) discuss the practical issues of implementing such a program; (iii) present the results of our RGRT program and (iv) review the potential uncertainties in using this technique and the methods we have used to overcome these. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients who had a 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) scan was undertaken. Records from treatment planning systems were used to assess the prospective gating program. Result(s): Between September 2007 and June 2011, 53 patients at Nepean and 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a 4D-CT. Between April and August 2011, 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a prospective 4D-CT scan as treatment verification. Two of the 26 patients (7.7%) were found to have incomplete coverage of the planning target volume. Both patients underwent respiratory re-coaching, alleviating the need for replanning. Conclusion(s): RGRT may reduce doses to organs at risk with the potential for dose escalation. However its implementation requires significant staff training, treatment time and resources. Treatment verification with image guided radiation therapy are essential for safe delivery. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
576,"Cervical lymph node involvement in carcinomas of the mobile tongue in Tunisia. Retrospective study of 135 cases OBJECTIVE: To report the profile of histologic cervical nodes involvement associated with mobile tongue squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study concerned patients treated from 1978 to 1998 by cervical neck dissection for mobile tongue carcinoma. RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded
2790,"Low-dose computed tomography versus plain abdominal radiography in the investigation of an acute abdomen Background: To compare low-dose abdominal computed tomography (LDCT) with plain abdominal radiography (AR) in the primary investigation of acute abdominal pain to determine if there is a difference in diagnostic yield, the number of additional investigations required and hospital length of stay (LOS). Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and who would normally be investigated with AR were randomized to either AR or LDCT. The estimated radiation dose of the LDCT protocol was 2-3mSv compared to 1.1mSv for AR. Pearson's chi-square and the independent samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 142 patients were eligible, and after exclusions and omitting those with incomplete data, 55 patients remained for analysis in the AR arm and 53 in the LDCT arm. A diagnosis could be obtained in 12 (21.8%) patients investigated with AR compared to 34 (64.2%) for LDCT (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight (50.9%) patients in the AR group required further imaging during their admission compared to 14 (26.4%) in the LDCT group (P= 0.009). There was no difference in the median hospital LOS (3.84 days for AR versus 4.24 days for LDCT, P= 0.83). Conclusion(s): LDCT demonstrates a superior diagnostic yield over AR and reduces the number of subsequent imaging tests for a minimal cost in radiation exposure. However, there is no difference in the overall hospital LOS between the two imaging strategies. © 2011 The Authors. ANZ Journal of Surgery © 2011 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Excluded
3165,"Impact of the Radiation Dose on Survival after Radiochemotherapy for Small-cell Lung Cancer AIM: Radiochemotherapy for small-cell lung cancer may not be sufficiently tolerated by all patients. To contribute to better personalization of the radiochemotherapy programs, this study compared two radiotherapy doses and 10 characteristics for survival., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 71 patients receiving radiochemotherapy for small-cell lung cancer, the radiation dose given as equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2: <56 vs. >=56 Gy) plus 10 characteristics, namely gender, age, Karnofsky performance score, T-category, N-category, tumor stage, pack years, smoking during radiotherapy, respiratory insufficiency and hemoglobin prior to radiotherapy, were evaluated for survival., RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, EQD2 >=56 Gy (p=0.003), female gender (p=0.029), Karnofsky performance score >70 (p<0.001), very limited disease (p=0.043) and pre-radiotherapy hemoglobin >=12 g/dl (p=0.044) were significantly associated with better survival., CONCLUSION: This study identified several independent predictors of survival after radiochemotherapy of small-cell lung cancer.

1521,"Diffusion tensor imaging study on radiation-induced brain injury in nasopharyngeal carcinoma during and after radiotherapy AIMS AND BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to monitor the mircostructure change of temporal lobe during the acute and subacute stage of radiation-induced brain injury using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients., METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: Eighty patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and treated with the first radiotherapy from July 2010 to May 2012 were enrolled. Routine brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and DTI were conducted in all patients before and during radiotherapy (radiation dose was 20, 40, and 60 Gy, respectively). The MRI and DTI were also performed in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd month after radiotherapy in 47 cases of 80 patients. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) of DTI during different stages were dynamically observed and analyzed., RESULTS: The ADC values were increased and the FA values were decreased with the increase of radiation dose (20, 40, and 60 Gy) during the radiotherapy, but there was no significant difference in ADC value or FA value between before and during radiotherapy (p>0.05). Compared with before radiotherapy, the ADC values were significantly increased and the FA values were significantly decreased at the 1st month, 2nd month, and 3rd month after radiotherapy (all p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion tensor imaging reflects the microstructure change of radiation-induced brain injury in the acute and subacute stage, which provides an objective basis for early intervention of potential irreversible brain injury in the late delayed stage, and has important significance for improving the overall efficacy of radiotherapy.",Excluded

Method(s): Between 1980 and 1988 at Varese University Hospital, 60 consecutive patients with T2N0 glottic carcinoma received exclusive radiotherapy consisting of 1.5 Gy/fraction twice a day. Treatment gaps during the radiotherapy course were allowed according to individual tolerance. This policy resulted in a wide range of elapsed treatment time: median, 5.7 weeks; range, 3.7-8.9. Median follow-up is 9.8 years. Result(s): As a result of dose/time distribution, 16, 20 and 24 patients received an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week or >10 Gy/week, respectively. Mean total dose for each group was 62.8 Gy, 63.7 Gy and 63.8 Gy, respectively. Five-year local-regional control was 69 +/- 6% (95% CI); ultimate local-regional control, including salvage surgery, was 78 +/- 5%. All failures were at the primary site, and no patient developed neck recurrence as first site of failure. The actuarial incidence of grade 2-3 late reactions at 5 years was 42 +/- 6%. Most late toxicity events were grade 2: only 2 patients developed grade 3 reactions and none grade 4. None of the several clinical and treatment-related variables showed any statistically significant impact on local-regional control or late toxicity at univariate and multivariate analysis. In particular, 3-year local-regional control rates were 73 +/- 11%, 84 +/- 8% and 69 +/- 10% for an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week and >10 Gy/week, respectively (not significantly different). Conclusion(s): At a very long follow-up, the hyperfractionated regimen tested in the study was shown to be effective and devoid of major complications, provided individual patient acute tolerance is carefully taken into account.

1188,"Initial experience with stereotactic body radiotherapy for intrahepatic hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation BACKGROUND Graft hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplant is more frequently encountered. Graft hepatectomy is technically challenging and is associated with high morbidity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of primary HCC. However, its role in HCC recurrence in a liver graft remains unclear. AIM To evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT for the treatment of graft HCC recurrence after liver transplantation. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. From 2012 to 2018, 6 patients with intrahepatic HCC recurrence after liver transplant were treated with SBRT at Queen Mary Hospital, the University of Hong Kong. The primary outcome was time to overall disease progression and secondary outcomes were time to local progression and best local response, as assessed with the Modified response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumours criteria. Patients were monitored for treatment related toxicities and graft dysfunction. RESULTS A total of 9 treatment courses were given for 13 tumours. The median tumour size was 2.3 cm (range 0.7-3.6 cm). Two (22%) patients had inferior vena cava tumour thrombus. The best local treatment response was: 5 (55%) complete response, 1 (11%) partial response and 3 (33%) stable disease. After a median follow up duration of 15.5 mo, no local progression or mortality was yet observed. The median time to overall disease progression was 6.5 mo. There were 6 regional progression in the liver graft (67%) and 2 distant progression in the lung (22%). There was no grade 3 or above toxicity and there was no graft dysfunction after SBRT. CONCLUSION SBRT appears to be safe in this context. Regional progression is the mode of failure.Copyright ©The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
1338,"Concurrent Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) and Radiation Therapy for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma: A Prospective Safety and Feasibility Study Background: TTFields are a loco-regional, anti-mitotic treatment comprising low-intensity alternating electric fields. In the EF-14 study of newly diagnosed glioblastoma (ndGBM), TTFields in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) significantly improved survival vs. TMZ alone. In preclinical studies TTFields had a radiosensitizing effect and increased the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT). This study prospectively evaluated the feasibility and safety of TTFields administered concurrently with RT and TMZ in ndGBM patients. Method(s): Patients with histologically confirmed ndGBM were treated with TTFields/RT/TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ/TTFields. TTFields (200 kHz) were delivered for >=18 hours/day with transducer arrays removed during RT delivery. RT was administered to the tumor bed in 30 fractions (total dose 60 Gy) combined with daily TMZ (75 mg/m2). In the adjuvant phase, patients received monthly TMZ (150-200 mg/m2 for 5 days) plus TTFields. Patients were followed for 24 months or until second disease progression. The primary outcome was safety of the combined therapies; secondary outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Adverse events (AEs) were graded per CTCAE v4.0. Result(s): Ten patients were enrolled at a single center between April and December 2017. Median age was 60.2 years, median Karnofsky Performance Score was 90.0, and 80% patients were male. Five (50%) patients had undergone tumor resection while the remainder had biopsy only. Eight patients experienced >=1 RT treatment delay; delays were unrelated to TTFields treatment. All patients experienced >=1 AE. Three patients suffered from serious AEs (urinary tract infection, confusional state, and decubitus ulcer) that were considered unrelated to TTFields. The most common AE was skin toxicity, reported in eight (80%) patients; all were of low severity (CTCAE grade 1-2) and were reported as related to TTFields treatment. Median PFS from enrollment was 8.9 months; median OS was not reached at the time of study closure. Conclusion(s): Eighty percent of patients experienced grade 1-2 TTFields-related skin toxicity. No other TTFields-related toxicities were observed without an increase in RT- or TMZ-related toxicities as a result of combining TTFields with these therapies. Preliminary efficacy results are promising and warrant further investigation of concurrent TTFields/RT/TMZ treatment in ndGBM patients.© Copyright © 2020 Bokstein, Blumenthal, Limon, Harosh, Ram and Grossman.",Excluded
126,"Medical monitoring: A beneficial remedy for residents living near an environmental hazard site Objective: People living close to an environmental hazard site may suffer health harms from real or perceived contaminant exposures. In class-action litigation, medical monitoring is a potential remedy that has been allowed in some jurisdictions but not others.

2565,"Dose escalation of gemcitabine concomitant with radiation and cisplatin for nonsmall cell lung cancer: A phase 1-2 study BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of weekly gemcitabine administered simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible.

2430,"Pilot study trialling a new ambulatory method for the clinical assessment of regional gastrointestinal transit using multiple electromagnetic capsules BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) motor disorders often involve several regions of the GI tract. Therefore, easy and safe assessment of whole gut and regional motility is valuable for more precise diagnosis. 3D-Transit is a novel method for ambulatory evaluation of total and regional gastrointestinal transit times (GITT) based on the anatomical localization of ingestible electromagnetic capsules. The main purpose of this study was to test the performance of the 3D-Transit system., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers each ingested three electromagnetic capsules over a period of two consecutive days. Standard radio-opaque markers (ROM) were also ingested to assess the agreement between total GITT obtained with both methods., KEY RESULTS: Investigations were well-tolerated and three capsules could be tracked simultaneously with minimal data loss (Capsule 1: median: 0.2% of time (range 0-25.3%). Region specific contraction patterns were identified and used for computation of total and regional GITT in all subjects. Inter-observer agreement was 100% for total GITT (median variation 0%) but less for regional GITT. Day-to-day and diurnal variations were significant for total and regional GITT. Total GITT assessed by 3D-Transit capsules were moderately well-correlated to those assessed with standard ROM (Spearman's rho = 0.7)., CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: 3D-transit is a well-tolerated and minimal invasive ambulatory method for assessment of GI motility. By providing both total and regional transit times, the 3D-Transit system holds great promise for future clinical studies of GI function in health and disease.

741,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
1410,"In vitro fertilization rate of mouse oocytes with spermatozoa from the F1 offspring of males irradiated with 1.0 Gy 137Cs gamma-rays Previous studies suggest that the spermatozoa from acutely irradiated male mice exhibit a reduced fertilization rate in vitro with the maximum decrease occurring for spermatozoa produced 6 weeks after irradiation (Y. Matsuda et al., Mutation Res. 142 (1985) 59-63). We have found that spermatozoa from unirradiated F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation also exhibit a significantly reduced fertilization rate in vitro. After acute 137Cs gamma-irradiation yielding an absorbed dose of 1.0 Gy, adult CD1 F0 male mice were mated at weekly intervals with unirradiated female CD1 mice. Unirradiated adult males from F1 litters conceived 5 and 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation were allowed to mature. Their epididymal spermatozoa were evaluated for in vitro fertilization rates using oocytes from unirradiated 8-12-week-old CD1 females. The mean fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (80.74 +/- 15.74 SD %, n = 5) did not differ significantly from the control fertilization rate (89.40 +/- 10.94 SD %, n = 8). However, the fertilization rate for spermatozoa from F1 males conceived 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (56.14 +/- 21.93 SD %, n = 5) was significantly less than the fertilization rate for control spermatozoa (p < 0.006) or for that of the F1 males conceived 5 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation (p < 0.04). These data suggest that spermatozoa obtained 6 weeks after paternal F0 irradiation can transmit a decrease in fertilization rate to the F1 generation males as well as exhibit decreased fertilization rate themselves when tested directly in vitro.",Excluded
2754,"Embo-EVAR: A Technique to Prevent Type II Endoleak? A Single-Center Experience Background Intraprocedural aneurysm sac embolization (embo-EVAR) during endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair (EVAR) using coils and fibrin glue is a technique for preventing type II endoleak (EII). Our aim is to evaluate feasibility, safety and clinical outcome of this promising approach. Materials and Methods A retrospective clinical case analysis of 72 patients who underwent EVAR during the period 2011-2014. Two groups were compared at 6 and 12 months follow-up with contrast media computed tomography scan and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging: consecutively, 36 patients (group A) treated with classic EVAR and 36 patients (group B) treated with embo-EVAR. Coils were released filling better as possible the aneurysm sac; the embolization was completed by injecting fibrin glue. Device and materials used, differential systemic and sac pressures, presence of any endoleak, and complication were registered. Results In our experience, we had 100% technical success without surgical conversion. Embo-EVAR was performed, after endograft deployment, in group B patients, all with ratio of DELTA-pressures (obtained from DELTA-sac pressure/DELTA-differential pressure) > 0.16. No early or late complications occurred and mortality was nil. Follow-up was performed with computed tomography-angiography and CEUS at 6 and 12 months. We observed 9 type II and 1 type Ia endoleak in group A and 2 type II and 1 type Ib endoleaks in group B. Mean radiation exposure time was 30.3 min in group A and 43.3 min in group B. EVAR procedure average cost was 9,000 . The average cost of sac embolization was 1,500. Conclusions Although a randomized study is necessary, embo-EVAR may be a valid approach to prevent type II endoleaks and further complications. Mild costs and exposure-dose increase could be accepted to avoid reinterventions, and in our experience, it could be routinely performed with excellent results.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2019,"Potential risk factors and outcomes of fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy Fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway following esophagectomy are a rare and severe complication with significant mortality. Treatment and therapy are difficult and require a multidisciplinary approach. The objective of this retrospective study was to identify risk factors for these fistulas following esophagetcomy, and to assess their impact on the further clinical course and outcome. 211 patients undergoing Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy for esophageal cancer between 2005 and 2012 were included. The preoperative risk factors including the risk score according to Schroder et al. and theO-Physiological and Operative Severity Score (POSSUM) score, operative and postoperative parameters and the outcome were evaluated. 65% of all patients developed postoperative complications, including 12 patients that developed fistulas between the upper intestinal tract and the airway (airway fistulas [AF]; 5.6%). Neither patient related risk factors nor esophagus-specific risk scores correlated with occurrence of AF. Furthermore, surgical treatment and neoadjuvant treatment did not show any effect on development of AF in our patients. However, we could demonstrate that AF significantly impacted on length of hospital stay (AF 52 days vs. No-AF group 16 days, P < 0.001), incidence of major pulmonary complications (83.3% vs. 17.1%, P < 0.001), 90-day mortality (42% vs. 7.5%, P=0.002) and overall survival (133 days vs. 636 days, P=0.029).With the current study, we could not identify any patient related risk factors, esophagus-specific risk scores or treatment related details that might be useful as predictors of AF after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. However, we confirmed that AF significantly impacted on outcomes.

We examined the efficacy and safety of SABR in this group of patients. Method(s): From January 2008 to December 2014, 15 patients with 17 lesions were included in this study. The lesions included 14 intrahepatic, 1 hilar, and 2 distal bile duct tumors. Three patients were classified as medically inoperable because of old age or multiple comorbidities. Tumors measured 0.8-13 cm (median, 3.6 cm). The median prescribed dose was 45 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Result(s): The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 29.9 months. Objective responses were observed for 10 of 17 tumors (58.8%), including 3 complete responses (17.6%). The median survival duration was 12.6 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 50.3% and 14.4%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year in-field failure-free rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2016 and October 2019, 454 consecutive patients with 501 SPNs who received CT-guided microcoil localization before VATS in our institution were enrolled. The diameter of the nodules was 0.93 +/- 0.49 cm, and the shortest distance from the nodules to the pleura was 1.41 +/- 0.95 cm. The distal end of the microcoil was placed less than 1 cm away from the nodule, and the proximal end was placed outside the visceral pleura. VATS was performed under the guidance of implanted microcoils without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy. RESULT(S): All 501 nodules were marked with microcoils. The time required for microcoil localization was 12.8 +/- 5.2 minutes. Microcoil localization-related complications occurred in 179 cases (39.4%). None of the complications required treatment. A total of 463 nodules were successfully resected under the guidance of implanted microcoils. VATS revealed 38 patients with dislocated microcoils, of which 28 underwent wedge resection (21 cases under the guidance of the bleeding points of pleural puncture, 7 cases through palpation), 5 underwent direct lobectomy, and the remaining 5 underwent a conversion to thoracotomy. In 4 cases, a portion of the microcoil remained in the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION(S): CT-guided microcoil localization of SPNs is safe and reliable. Marking the nodule and pleura simultaneously with microcoils can effectively guide the resection of SPNs using VATS without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded

1,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

993,"Magnetic resonance enterocolonography is useful for simultaneous evaluation of small and large intestinal lesions in Crohn's disease BACKGROUND: We developed novel magnetic resonance enterocolonography (MREC) for simultaneously evaluating both small and large bowel lesions in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of MREC by comparing results of this procedure to those of endoscopies for evaluating the small and large bowel lesions of patients with CD., METHODS: Thirty patients with established CD were prospectively examined by newly developed MREC. Patients underwent ileocolonoscopy (ICS) (24 procedures) or double-balloon endoscopy (DBE) (10 procedures) after MREC on the same day. Two gastroenterologists and two radiologists who were blinded to the results of another study evaluated endoscopy and MREC findings, respectively., RESULTS: In colonic lesions the sensitivities of the MREC for deep mucosal lesions (DML), all CD lesions, and stenosis were 88.2, 61.8, and 71.4%, respectively, while the specificities were 98.1, 95.3, and 97.7%, respectively. In small intestinal lesions, MREC sensitivities for DML, all CD lesions, and stenosis were 100, 85.7, and 100%, respectively, while specificities were 100, 90.5, and 93.1%, respectively. Endoscopic scores were significantly correlated with MREC scores. Eleven (46%) of the 24 patients who were clinically not suspected to show stricture were observed to demonstrate stricture by radiologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated that MREC can simultaneously detect the CD lesions of the small and large intestine. MREC can be performed without radiation exposure, the use of enema, or the placement of a naso-jejunal catheter. MREC and endoscopy have comparable abilities for evaluating mucosal lesions of patients with CD. Copyright © 2010 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, Inc.",Excluded
1821,"Validation of a New Method for 2D Fusion Imaging Registration in a System Prepared Only for 3D Purpose: To validate a new 2D-3D registration method of fusion imaging during aortic repair in a system prepared only for 3D-3D registration and to compare radiation doses and accuracy. Materials and Methods: The study involved 189 patients, including 94 patients (median age 70 years; 85 men) who underwent abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with 2D-3D fusion on an Artis zee imaging system and 95 EVAR patients (median age 70 years; 81 men) from a prior study who had 3D-3D registration done using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). For the 2D-3D registration, an offline CBCT of the empty operating table was imported into the intraoperative dataset and superimposed on the preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Then 2 intraoperative single-frame 2D images of the skeleton were aligned with the patient's skeleton on the preoperative CTA to complete the registration process. A digital subtraction angiogram was done to correct any misalignment of the aortic CTA volume. Values are given as the median [interquartile range (IQR) Q1, Q3]. Results: The 2D-3D registration had an accuracy of 4.0 mm (IQR 3.0, 5.0) after bone matching compared with the final correction with DSA (78% within 5 mm). By applying the 2D-3D protocol the radiation exposure (dose area product) from the registration of the fusion image was significantly reduced compared with the 3D-3D registration [1.12 Gy.cm2 (IQR 0.41, 2.14) vs 43.4 Gy.cm2 (IQR 37.1, 49.0), respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion: The new 2D-3D registration protocol based on 2 single-frame images avoids an intraoperative CBCT and can be used for fusion imaging registration in a system originally designed for 3D-3D only. This 2D-3D registration protocol is accurate and leads to a significant reduction in radiation exposure.",Excluded
318,"Prospective Pilot Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Purpose: With the improvement concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), distant failures have become a more relevant problem in terms of survival. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation after primary CCRT for patients with HNSCC. Methods and Materials: Patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on Days 1, 22, and 43. Concurrent radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck was given in a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 70-70.2 Gy over 7 weeks. After completion of CCRT, patients without evidence of disease progression received an additional four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Result(s): Of 33 patients, 27 (81%) completed CCRT. After CCRT, three complete and 19 partial responses were recorded, giving an overall response rate of 67%. Of 19 patients who went to the consolidation phase, only 4 (21%) received all four cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin. Causes of failure of consolidation chemotherapy were toxicity in 11 patients, including three treatment-related deaths, and progression in 4 patients. Three patients died of sepsis during the consolidation phase. Median survival was 11 months for all patients and 8 months for those treated with consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The poor compliance and high incidence of severe toxicities prompted no further evaluation of this consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

2226,"Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) shear wave elastography of the bowel wall in healthy volunteers and in ulcerative colitis Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography is a non-invasive, ultrasound-based approach of evaluation of tissue elasticity. It has not yet been systematically applied to the bowel wall. Purpose(s): To perform ARFI elastography of the bowel wall in healthy volunteers and patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Material(s) and Method(s): A high-frequency ultrasound (with bowel wall thickness and vascularization score) and an ARFI elastography of the bowel wall were performed in 20 patients with UC and 13 healthy volunteers. At least 10 ARFI measurements were obtained within the terminal ileum and the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon and correlated with results of high-frequency ultrasound. Result(s): The UC group had mostly moderate disease activity. All patients had signs of inflammation upon B-mode ultrasound. Eight patients showed an ulcerative (ileo)pancolitis. Overall, ARFI elastography values and wall thickness were higher in the UC group than in the group of healthy volunteers (P = 0.021 and P < 0.001, respectively). ARFI velocities of the separate segments were significantly higher in the transverse (P = 0.045) and sigmoid colon (P = 0.032) in case of UC. Conclusion(s): ARFI elastography of the bowel wall of the colonic frame and the terminal ileum is feasible but shows high standard deviation. ARFI shear wave velocities appear to be slightly higher in patients with UC than in healthy volunteers, particularly in the sigmoid and transverse colon.

1350,"Informatics in radiology: use of a C-arm fluoroscopy simulator to support training in intraoperative radiography Mobile image intensifier systems (C-arms) are used frequently in orthopedic and reconstructive surgery, especially in trauma and emergency settings, but image quality and radiation exposure levels may vary widely, depending on the extent of the C-arm operator's knowledge and experience. Current training programs consist mainly of theoretical instruction in C-arm operation, the physical foundations of radiography, and radiation avoidance, and are largely lacking in hands-on application. A computer-based simulation program such as that tested by the authors may be one way to improve the effectiveness of C-arm training. In computer simulations of various scenarios commonly encountered in the operating room, trainees using the virtX program interact with three-dimensional models to test their knowledge base and improve their skill levels. Radiographs showing the simulated patient anatomy and surgical implants are ""reconstructed"" from data computed on the basis of the trainee's positioning of models of a C-arm, patient, and table, and are displayed in real time on the desktop monitor. Trainee performance is signaled in real time by color graphics in several control panels and, on completion of the exercise, is compared in detail with the performance of an expert operator. Testing of this computer-based training program in continuing medical education courses for operating room personnel showed an improvement in the overall understanding of underlying principles of intraoperative radiography performed with a C-arm, with resultant higher image quality, lower overall radiation exposure, and greater time efficiency.

Most of these tissues were radioprotected, and the degree of radioprotection depended on the dose of WR-2721 and the time interval between administration of WR-2721 and radiation treatment. WR-2721 increased resistance of jejunal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells to single doses of gamma-rays by factors of 1.64 and 1.54, respectively. Protection against hair loss was less pronounced; the dose-modifying factor here was 1.24. The radiation-induced acute damage of the lung expressed by the increased formation of tumor nodules in the lung was not decreased by treatment of animals with WR-2721 before radiation. In contrast, WR-2721 augmented the radiation-induced enhancement of metastasis formation in the lung. WR-2721 protected fibrosarcoma micrometastases in the lung against therapeutic effect of radiation by a factor of 1.238. In contrast, this compound had no effect on the therapy of an 8-mm fibrosarcoma growing in the legs of mice.",Excluded

Two hundred sixty patients (male, 111; female, 149; median age, 68 years) with histologically proven MMHN were enrolled., RESULTS: Primary sites included the nasal cavity in 178 patients, paranasal sinuses in 43, oral cavity in 27, and pharynx in 12. Eighty-six patients had T3 tumors, 147 had T4a tumors, and 27 had T4b tumors. Two hundred fifty-one patients were diagnosed with N0 disease, and 9 with N1 disease. The median total dose and number of fractions were 57.6 Gy RBE (relative biological effectiveness) and 16, respectively. Chemotherapy including dimethyl traizeno imidazole carboxamide was used concurrently in 129 patients. The median follow-up duration was 22 months (range, 1-132 months). The 2-year overall survival and local control rates were 69.4% and 83.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that gross tumor volume and concurrent chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for overall survival. Grade 3 and grade 4 late morbidities were observed in 27 and 7 patients (5 developed ipsilateral blindness, 1 mucosal ulcer, and 1 second malignant disease in the irradiated volume), respectively. No patients developed grade 5 late morbidities., CONCLUSION: Carbon-ion RT is a promising treatment option for MMHN. Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

2103,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included
2130,"Radiation-induced changes in late effects and in developmental capacities of exposed artemia cysts Artemia dry cysts from a Californian bisexual strain used in several space experiments were irradiated with 60Co gamma rays. The three cyst populations experimented could be differentiated according to their development and survival rates. The variations observed for both of these criteria were related to the age of the cysts and the selection technique. The study of radiosensitivity based on LD50 value showed that the highest radiosensitivity differences were related to the cyst selection technique and not to the age. Furthermore, the three cyst populations showed that radio-induced lethal effects were enhanced, or appeared with time, namely following the delay between irradiation and the cyst development study. The observation of late effects after irradiations or after space flights show the difficulties encountered in assessing radiative risks during long duration space flights.",Excluded
3294,"Ultrasonographic Features of the Major Salivary Glands after Radioactive Iodine Ablation in Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic features of the major salivary glands (MSGs) after post-operative radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The study population comprised 202 consecutively registered PTC patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy, RIA and follow-up neck ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic features of the MSGs in each patient were retrospectively evaluated by a single radiologist, and the presence of post-RIA changes was determined by direct comparisons of pre- and post-RIA follow-up ultrasonographic scans. Of the 202 patients, 94 (46.5%) had post-RIA changes in the MSGs on follow-up ultrasonography. RIA dose was closely associated with the prevalence of post-RIA changes. Post-RIA changes were more common in the parotid glands (n = 93, 46.0%) than in the submandibular glands (n = 7, 3.5%). Common ultrasonographic findings representing post-RIA changes in MSGs included coarse echotexture, decreased echogenicity, lobulated margin and decreased gland size.

894,"Usefulness of additional coronary calcium scoring in low-dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering impact on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of additional coronary calcium scoring on total effective radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy of low-dose computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients underwent 64-slice CTCA using prospective ECG triggering, calcium scoring, and invasive quantitative coronary angiography, the latter served as standard of reference. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated for CTCA, calcium scoring, and for the combination of both. Receiver operator characteristic analyses were performed to determine cutoffs for prediction of significant coronary artery stenoses., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose was 2.1 + or - 0.7 mSv (range, 1.0-3.3 mSv) for CTCA and 1.1 + or - 0.1 mSv (range, 0.9-1.4 mSv) for calcium scoring. Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 85.7%, 89.2%, and 100% for CTCA, and 72.7%, 82.1%, 82.8%, and 71.9% for calcium scoring. Adding calcium-scoring with a cutoff at 133 in patients aged >50.7 years with nondiagnostic CTCA improved the respective values of diagnostic accuracy of the entire study population to 100%, 96.4%, 97.1%, and 100%; the added value of calcium scoring was confined to only three patients (5%), who were reclassified from false positive to true negative., CONCLUSION: Specificity and PPV of low-dose CTCA may be further improved by combining it with coronary calcium scoring. However, only a fraction of patient may benefit, whereas exposing the entire population to more than 50% increase in effective radiation dose. Copyright 2010 AUR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Method(s): A total of 72 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which were admitted to our hospital from October 2011 to December 2013, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Result(s): Thirty-six patients (50%) were treated with IMRT alone, while the other 36 patients (50%) were treated by IMRT combined with chemotherapy containing liposomal paclitaxel and cisplatin. Patients treated with chemoradiotherapy showed significantly superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to patients treated with IMRT alone (median OS: respectively, 29.7 vs. 12.9 months, P=0.0287; median PFS: respectively, 14.0 vs. 6.5 months, P=0.0186). Multivariate Cox analysis confirmed the inclusion of chemotherapy as an independent predictor of favorable OS and PFS. Both chemoradiotherapy and IMRT were well-tolerated in our cohort. Conclusion(s): Chemotherapy improved the prognosis of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with IMRT.

1677,"Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be determined with 1.5-T and 3-T neck MRI scans, in the event that no neck CT scan is performed Objectives: Cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of the neck musculature at the level of third cervical vertebra (C3) on CT scans are used to diagnose radiological sarcopenia, which is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Alternatively, these assessments are performed with neck MRI, which has not been validated so far. For that, the objective was to evaluate whether skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can be assessed on neck MRI scans. Method(s): HNC patients were included between November 2014 and November 2018 from a prospective data-biobank. CSAs of the neck musculature at the C3 level were measured on CT (n = 125) and MRI neck scans (n = 92 on 1.5-T, n = 33 on 3-T). Measurements were converted into skeletal muscle index (SMI), and sarcopenia was defined (SMI < 43.2 cm2/m2). Pearson correlation coefficients, Bland-Altman plots, McNemar test, Cohen's kappa coefficients, and interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were estimated. Result(s): CT and MRI correlated highly on CSA and SMI (r = 0.958-0.998, p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plots showed a nihil mean DELTASMI (- 0.13-0.44 cm2/m2). There was no significant difference between CT and MRI in diagnosing sarcopenia (McNemar, p = 0.5-1.0). Agreement on sarcopenia diagnosis was good with kappa = 0.956-0.978 and kappa = 0.870-0.933, for 1.5-T and 3-T respectively. Observer ICCs in MRI were excellent. In general, T2-weighted images had the best correlation and agreement with CT. Conclusion(s): Skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia can interchangeably be assessed on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans. This allows future clinical outcome assessment during treatment irrespective of used modality. Key Points: * Screening for low amount of skeletal muscle mass is usually measured on neck CT scans and is highly clinical relevant as it is related to multiple adverse outcomes in head and neck cancer patients. * We found that skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia determined on CT and 1.5-T and 3-T MRI neck scans at the C3 level can be used interchangeably. * When CT imaging of the neck is missing for skeletal muscle mass analysis, patients can be assessed with 1.5-T or 3-T neck MRIs.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
2601,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included
708,"Uranium in drinking water: Renal effects of long-term ingestion by an aboriginal community The authors conducted a study of an aboriginal community to determine if kidney func-tion had been affected by the chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water from the community's drilled wells. Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480).

2007,"Abdominal circumference but not the degree of lumbar flexion affects the accuracy of lumbar interspace identification by Tuffier's line palpation method: An observational study Background: Lumbar puncture for spinal or epidural anesthesia is commonly performed by palpating bony landmarks, but identification of the desired intervertebral level is often inaccurate. It is unclear whether such inaccuracy is related to patient factors, such as body mass index and degree of lumbar flexion. We hypothesized that overweight patients and patients with less of an ability to hyperflex their lumbar spines are prone to inaccurate lumbar spinous intervertebral level identification. Method(s): 52 adult volunteers were included in this study. 7 anesthesiologists with different years of experience identified and marked subjects' levels of the iliac crests, then marked the presumed interspaces. Lumbar X-ray was then performed with metal markers, and actual radiographic findings were identified and compared to the initial markings. Result(s): Patients with larger abdominal circumferences (mean (SD), 94.0(12.1) cm), higher body mass indices (25.9(3.9) kg/m), and aged between 50 and 70 years old had lumbar interspaces that were higher than the presumed level; patients with smaller abdominal circumferences (82.8(13.5) cm) and lower body mass indices (21.6(4.1) kg/m) had intervertebral levels that were lower than the presumed level. Cobb's angle, indicating the degree of lumbar flexion, did not affect the accuracy obtained. Conclusion(s): Patients' abdominal circumference, body mass index, and age are factors that may impact the accuracy of lumbar level identification. Tuffier's line, as identified by palpation, does not seem to be a reliable landmark for proper lumbar interspace identification in all cases.Copyright © Lin et al.",Excluded

Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with Stage I-II (23%) or III/IV (77%) HNC treated by definitive IMRT were included. For all LR failure patients, the FDG-PET and CT scans documenting recurrence were rigidly registered to the initial treatment planning CT. Failure volumes (Vf) were delineated based on clinical, radiological, and histological data. The percentage of Vf covered by 95% of the prescription isodose (Vf-V95) was analyzed. Failures were classified as "" in-field"" if Vf-V95 >= 95%, "" marginal"" if 20% < Vf-V95 < 95%, and "" out-of-field"" if Vf-V95 <=20%. Correlation between Vf-V95 and mean doses (Dmean) in the PG, SMG, and OC was assessed using Spearman's rank-order correlation test. The salivary gland dose impact on the LR recurrence risk was assessed by Cox analysis. Result(s): The median follow-up was 20 months (6-35). Contralateral and ipsilateral PGs were spared in 98% and 54% of patients, respectively, and contralateral and ipsilateral SMG in 26% and 7%, respectively. The OC was spared to a dose <=40 Gy in 26 patients (37%). The 2-year LR control rate was 76.5%. One recurrence was "" marginal"" , and 12 were "" in-field"" No recurrence was observed in vicinity of spared structures. Vf-V95 was not significantly correlated with Dmean in PG, SMG, and OC. The LR recurrence risk was not increased by lower Dmean in the salivary glands, but by T (p = 0.04) and N stages (p = 0.03).

Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P <= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Data were analyzed from March 13, 2018, to June 12, 2019., Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant., Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was time to development of the first cutaneous keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT; secondary outcome, time to development of the first individual basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma after alloHCT., Results: Of the 872 alloHCT recipients identified in the Mayo Clinic cohort (520 men [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 48.3 [12.6] years), 95 (10.9%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT during 5349 person-years of follow-up. Of the 147 alloHCT recipients in the exernal validation cohort (86 men [58.5%]; mean [SD] age, 47.9 [17.5] years), 18 (12.2%) developed keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT in 880 person-years of follow up. Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91). Harrell concordance statistics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for internal and external validation of the keratinocyte carcinoma risk model, respectively., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found validated independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT that are enriched with host- compared with transplant-associated risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",Excluded
3105,"A novel screw guiding method with a screw guide template system for posterior C-2 fixation: Clinical article Object. Accurate insertion of C-2 cervical screws is imperative; however, the procedures for C-2 screw insertion are technically demanding and challenging, especially in cases of C-2 vertebral abnormality. The purpose of this study is to report the effectiveness of the tailor-made screw guide template (SGT) system for placement of C-2 screws, including in cases with abnormalities. Methods. Twenty-three patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion surgery with C-2 cervical screw insertion using the SGT system were included. The preoperative bone image on CT was analyzed using multiplanar imaging software. The trajectory and depth of the screws were designed based on these images, and transparent templates with screw guiding cylinders were created for each lamina. During the operation, after templates were engaged directly to the laminae, drilling, tapping, and screwing were performed through the templates. The authors placed 26 pedicle screws, 12 pars screws, 6 laminar screws, and 4 C1-2 transarticular screws using the SGT system. To assess the accuracy of the screw track under this system, the deviation of the screw axis from the preplanned trajectory was evaluated on postoperative CT and was classified as follows: Class 1 (accurate), a screw axis deviation less than 2 mm from the planned trajectory; Class 2 (inaccurate), 2 mm or more but less than 4 mm; and Class 3 (deviated), 4 mm or more. In addition, to assess the safety of the screw insertion, malpositioning of the screws was also evaluated using the following grading system: Grade 0 (containing), a screw is completely within the wall of the bone structure; Grade 1 (exposure), a screw perforates the wall of the bone structure but more than 50% of the screw diameter remains within the bone; Grade 2 (perforation), a screw perforates the bone structures and more than 50% of the screw diameter is outside the pedicle; and Grade 3 (penetration), a screw perforates completely outside the bone structure. Results. In total, 47 (97.9%) of 48 screws were classified into Class 1 and Grade 0, whereas 1 laminar screw was classified as Class 3 and Grade 2. Mean screw deviations were 0.36 mm in the axial plane (range 0.0-3.8 mm) and 0.30 mm in the sagittal plane (range 0.0-0.8 mm). Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the SGT system provided extremely accurate C-2 cervical screw insertion without configuration of reference points, high-dose radiation from intraoperative 3D navigation, or any registration or probing error evoked by changes in spinal alignment during surgery. A multistep screw placement technique and reliable screw guide cylinders were the key to accurate screw placement using the SGT system. ©AANS, 2014.",Excluded
1551,"Radon Risk Communication Information on the health effects of radon exposure requires different strategies and approaches for risk communica-tion. Radon exposure and health effects are perceived based on the knowledge of the source and the ability to accept it as a health hazard. The purpose of this study was to assess the level of awareness and knowledge of radon and to identify the preferred sources of information for different target groups. The analysis was made by gender, ager education and socio-professional status. A questionnaire was developed. There was a total of 880 completed a ""face-to-face"" surveys in this study to randomly selected persons. It is estimated that 70% of all participants know what radon is, but a relatively small percentage of people who have azheard about radona know that radon causes lung cancer; The percentage of respondents who have more knowledge of the source and potential effects increases with the increase of educational level and is related to the profession. Just over half of those who know that radon is harmful tend to test their home. Several awareness-raising methods for different occupational groups have been identified. This study pro-vides useful information on effective risk communication with the public, which is a major component of the public health system.Copyright © 2020 Medical Information Center.

162,"Nonlinear interactions of high-frequency oscillations in the human somatosensory system OBJECTIVE: The source of somatosensory evoked high-frequency activity at about 600 Hz is still not completely clear. Hence, we aimed to study the influence of double stimulation on the human somatosensory system by analyzing both the low-frequency activity and the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at about 600 Hz., METHODS: We used median nerve stimulation at seven interstimuli intervals (ISIs) with a high time resolution between 2.4 and 4.8 ms to investigate the N15, N20 and superimposed HFOs. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram and the magnetoencephalogram of 12 healthy participants were recorded. Subsequently, the source analysis of precortical and cortical dipoles was performed., RESULTS: The difference computations of precortical dipole activation curves showed in both the low- and high-frequency range a correlation between the ISI and the latency of the second stimulus response. The cortical low-frequency response showed a similar behavior. Contrarily, in the second response of cortical HFOs this latency shift could not be confirmed. We found amplitude fluctuations that were dependent on the ISI in the low-frequency activity and the HFOs. These nonlinear interactions occurred at ISIs, which differ by one full HFO period (1.6 ms)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency activity and HFOs originate from different generators. Precortical and cortical HFOs are independently generated. The amplitude fluctuations dependent on ISI indicate nonlinear interference between successive stimuli., SIGNIFICANCE: Information processing in human somatosensory system includes nonlinearity.",Excluded
1278,"Disc height and motion patterns in the lumbar spine in patients operated with total disc replacement or fusion for discogenic back pain. Results from a randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Fusion is considered the ""gold standard"" in surgical treatment of degenerated disc disease; the intended postoperative goal is absence of mobility, but treatment may induce degeneration in adjacent segments. Total disc replacement (TDR) aims to restore and maintain mobility by replacing a painful disc. Little is known about the degree and quality of mobility in artificial discs in vivo and whether maintained mobility reduces the stress on adjacent segments that is believed to occur after fusion. PURPOSE: To see if surgical goals for respective treatments had been reached, if clinical outcome was related to this, and if differences in disc height at treated segments and adjacent segment motion patterns between groups occurred. STUDY DESIGN: Comparison of X-ray measurements in a randomized controlled trial between instrumented posterior fusion and TDR for chronic low back pain (CLBP) assumed to be discogenic. Results were compared with clinical outcome. PATIENT SAMPLE: The material consisted of 152 patients suffering from CLBP assumed to be discogenic. Seventy-two patients were treated with fusion and 80 with TDR. OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of X-ray measurements were compared between groups and related to self-reported clinical results regarding back pain and disability. METHOD(S): Flexion-extension X-rays were analyzed preoperatively and 2 years postoperatively using distortion-compensated Roentgen analysis (DCRA) at treated and adjacent levels, and mobility after fusion and TDR was estimated. Changes in disc height and range of motion (ROM) respective translation in adjacent segments were compared between groups. Results of DCRA measurements were also compared with the clinical outcome. RESULT(S): Preoperative flexion-extension ROM was similar between the fusion and TDR groups, and preoperative disc heights of segments to be treated were between one and two standard deviation less than that previously established in a normative database. Seventy percent of fused patients had no mobility, whereas 85% of TDR patients were mobile. Fulfillment of surgical goals was correlated to neither back pain nor disability. Fused segments were lower and TDR segments were higher than normative values postoperatively. There were also significant differences at adjacent segments, there being more translation and flexion-extension in the fusion group than in the TDR group. CONCLUSION(S): This very accurate X-ray method (DCRA) indicates that surgical goals were reached in most patients. This, however, was not correlated to clinical outcome. Differences between the groups in postoperative disc height at treated segments, respective ROM, and translation at adjacent segments did not affect the clinical outcome after 2 years. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

1072,"Polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes in radiation-related and sporadic papillary thyroid carcinoma Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) etiologically occurs as a radiation-induced or sporadic malignancy. Genetic factors contributing to the susceptibility to either form remain unknown. In this retrospective case-control study, we evaluated possible associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the candidate DNA damage response genes (ATM, XRCC1, TP53, XRCC3, MTF1) and risk of radiation-induced and sporadic PTC. A total of 255 PTC cases (123 Chernobyl radiation-induced and 132 sporadic, all in Caucasians) and 596 healthy controls (198 residents of Chernobyl areas and 398 subjects without history of radiation exposure, all Caucasians) were genotyped. The risk of PTC and SNPs interactions with radiation exposure were assessed by logistic regressions. The ATM G5557A and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphisms, regardless of radiation exposure, associated with a decreased risk of PTC according to the multiplicative and dominant models of inheritance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.45-0.86 and OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.59-0.93 respectively). The ATM IVS22-77 T > C and TP53 Arg72Pro SNPs interacted with radiation (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01 respectively). ATM IVS22-77 associated with the increased risk of sporadic PTC (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.10-3.24) whereas TP53 Arg72Pro correlated with the higher risk of radiogenic PTC (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.06-2.36). In the analyses of ATM/TP53 (rs1801516/rs664677/rs609429/rs1042522) combinations, the GG/TC/CG/GC genotype strongly associated with radiation-induced PTC (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.17-3.78). The GG/CC/GG/GG genotype displayed a significantly increased risk for sporadic PTC (OR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.57-6.99). The results indicate that polymorphisms of DNA damage response genes may be potential risk modifiers of ionizing radiation-induced or sporadic PTCs.",Included
3036,"Overwhelming support among urban Irish COPD patients for lung cancer screening by low-dose CT scan PURPOSE: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) has renewed interest in low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer. Smokers may be less receptive toward LDCT screening, however, compared with never smokers. The views of patients with COPD, a particularly high-risk group, toward LDCT screening for lung cancer are currently unknown. We therefore evaluated attitudes of patients with COPD toward LDCT screening for lung cancer., METHODS: Interviews with Irish patients with COPD who satisfied NLST eligibility criteria were conducted in clinical settings using a questionnaire based on that of a comparable study of U.S. current/former smokers of unspecified disease status., RESULTS: A total of 142 subjects had a mean age of 65.09 +/- 6.07 years (46.4 % were male, mean pack years 54.5 +/- 33.3, mean FEV1 59.16 +/- 23 %); 97.8 % had an identifiable usual source of healthcare. Compared with data from a U.S. cohort of current/former smokers, a higher proportion of Irish COPD smokers: believed that they were at risk for lung cancer (63.6 vs. 15.7 %); believed that early detection improved chances of survival (90 vs. 51.2 ); were willing to consider LDCT screening (97.9 vs. 78.6 %); were willing to pay for a LDCT scan (68.6 vs. 36.2 %); and were willing to accept treatment recommendations arising (95.7 vs. 56.2 %; p < 0.0001 for all comparisons)., CONCLUSIONS: Urban Irish smokers with COPD who would be eligible for LDCT screening are almost universally in favor of being screened and treated for screening-detected lung cancers. This readily accessible high-risk population should be actively targeted in future screening programs.",Excluded
2256,"Long-term survival and symptom palliation in small primary bronchial carcinomas following treatment with intraluminal radiotherapy alone Between April 1988 and December 1992, 37 patients with small, previously unirradiated, primary non-small cell carcinomas of the bronchus causing symptoms due to endobronchial disease were treated at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, with a single fraction of high dose rate intraluminal radiotherapy (ILT) using the microSelectron-HDR machine. Small primary (SP) lesions were defined as being less than 2 cm in diameter in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the iridium-192 treatment source. Fifteen patients (41%) were treated to a dose of 15 Gy and 22 patients (59%) to 20 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the central axis of the source. At 6 weeks following ILT, improvement in symptoms was seen in the following percentages of patients: haemoptysis 96%, pulmonary collapse 69%, cough 55% and dyspnoea 52%. The magnitude of improvement in these symptoms was largely maintained in patients surviving to 4 months and then 12 months post-ILT. Median actuarial survival was 709 days, 2-year survival 49.4% and 5-year survival 14.1%. Overall, there was no significant difference in survival after treatment with 20 Gy compared with 15 Gy at 1 cm. At the close of study, there were four patients still alive without disease recurrence with survivals of 38, 48, 49 and 63 months. All had had biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas and all had been treated with 20 Gy at 1 cm. Five patients died from massive haemoptysis as a terminal event at 4, 9, 9, 10 and 11 months post-ILT, well below the median survival for this group of patients. Again, all had been treated with 20 Gy as opposed to 15 Gy at 1 cm. Over the same time period, 287 patients with non-small cell carcinomas of more than 2 cm in diameter (large primary lesions, LP), were treated with a single fraction of ILT only, as their initial treatment. A consistently greater percentage of patients with SP lesions showed an improvement in the symptoms of haemoptysis and pulmonary collapse when compared with patients with LP lesions. Patients with LP lesions demonstrated a decreased actuarial survival when compared with SP lesions, with median survival being 156 days, 2-year survival 3.1% and no survivors beyond 39 months. This study demonstrates that, in patients with small endobronchial carcinomas a single fraction of ILT can give efficient palliation of symptoms and lead to long term disease-free survival, but that a dose of 20 Gy may be at the limit of bronchial radiation tolerance for a single dose technique employing a high dose rate source.",Excluded
1362,"UCP-3 uncoupling protein confers hypoxia resistance to renal epithelial cells and is upregulated in renal cell carcinoma Tumor cells can adapt to a hostile environment with reduced oxygen supply. The present study aimed to identify mechanisms that confer hypoxia resistance. Partially hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-resistant proximal tubular (PT) cells were selected by exposing PT cultures to repetitive cycles of H/R. Thereafter, H/R-induced changes in mRNA and protein expression, inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DELTAPSI(m)), formation of superoxide, and cell death were compared between H/R-adapted and control PT cultures. As a result, H/R-adapted PT cells exhibited lower H/R-induced hyperpolarization of DELTAPSI(m) and produced less superoxide than the control cultures. Consequently, H/R triggered DELTAPSI(m) break-down and DNA degradation in a lower percentage of H/R-adapted than control PT cells. Moreover, H/R induced upregulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-3 (UCP-3) in H/R-adapted PT but not in control cultures. In addition, ionizing radiation killed a lower percentage of H/R-adapted as compared to control cells suggestive of an H/R-radiation cross-resistance developed by the selection procedure. Knockdown of UCP-3 decreased H/R- and radioresitance of the H/R-adapted cells. Finally, UCP-3 protein abundance of PT-derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma and normal renal tissue was compared in human specimens indicating upregulation of UCP-3 during tumor development. Combined, our data suggest functional significance of UCP-3 for H/R resistance.",Excluded
744,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded
2694,"Low-dose coronary computed tomography angiography using prospective ECG-triggering compared to invasive coronary angiography To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prospective ECG-triggering 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-two patients (31 males, 11 females, mean age 64 years) underwent cardiac CT and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Patients with a heart rate of <65 beats/min with stable heart rhythm were included in the study sample. We used a prospective ECG-triggering protocol. Luminal narrowing over 50% was considered to be significant according to a modified 17-segment AHA model, using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the standard of reference. The mean radiation dose was 3.5 mSv +/- 0.3 (range, 3.3-4.2 mSv), and 542 of 549 segments (98.7%) in the 42 patients were diagnostic. In contrast, 119 of 542 segments (22%) were diagnosed as significant by ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were 95.0, 96.2, 96, 85.8 and 98.8%, respectively. False positive results were affected by densely calcified plaques, whereas false negatives were caused by motion artifact with poor vessel attenuation at the distal segments or near the bifurcation area of the coronary arteries.

3078,"A preliminary experience of moderate-intensity stereotactic body radiation therapy for ultra-central lung tumor Purpose: Administration of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to ultra-central (UC) lung tumors, generally defined as those abutting the proximal bronchial trees, is difficult due to concerns about serious toxicities. Therefore, our institution has performed moderate-intensity SBRT. Patients and Methods: Patients with UC tumors underwent SBRT at a dose of 50-60 Gy in 10 fractions, with Dmax in the target volume not exceeding 110% of the prescribed dose. The primary outcomes were tumor response and overall survival (OS). Result(s): From January 2017 to September 2018, we treated eight patients who had been diagnosed with UC tumors. The median follow-up time was 8.6 months (range: 2.7-14.9). Five of the eight patients (62.5%) showed a complete response (CR), two (25%) had a partial response (PR), and one (12.5%) had stable disease (SD); the response and disease control rates were 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Seven patients were alive with no evidence of disease or with controlled disease until the last follow-ups, except for one patient who died due to a non-RT cause at 3 months after SBRT. One patient experienced grade 2 esophageal pain and another had grade 1 cough. No grade 3 or higher toxicities were reported. Conclusion(s): Moderate-intensity SBRT might aid in achieving good control of UC tumors without excessive toxicities. Future studies involving larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up times are warranted to confirm the efficacy and feasibility.© 2019, Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
1827,"A specific melon concentrate exhibits photoprotective effects from antioxidant activity in healthy adults Skin is the largest body organ and the first barrier to exogenous threats. This organ is constantly exposed to external factors such as ultraviolet radiation, which induces many adverse effects including sunburn, depigmentation, photo aging, photo immune suppression, and even skin cancer. Antioxidants seem to be good candidates in order to reduce ultraviolet-mediated damages and to prevent the health consequences of ultraviolet exposure. The present investigation aims to further characterize the potential skin photoprotective effects of a food supplementation and a topical administration of a melon concentrate alone or in combination. A clinical study assessing the Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) was first set up to evaluate photoprotection. Afterward, an independent in vitro study was performed on human skin explants from a donor to evaluate the effect of the melon concentrate at different levels including on the sunburn cells formation and on the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and its influence on melanin. Clinical study results demonstrate that melon concentrate application and/or supplementation increased MED. It also increased the endogenous antioxidant enzymes and reduced sunburn cells and melanin level on irradiated skin explants. Therefore, it is suggested that melon concentrate administration (oral and/or topical) could be a useful strategy for photoprotection due to its antioxidant properties.Copyright © 2018 by the authors.

3408,"Feasibility of wall stress analysis of abdominal aortic aneurysms using three-dimensional ultrasound OBJECTIVE: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are local dilations that can lead to a fatal hemorrhage when ruptured. Wall stress analysis of AAAs is a novel tool that has proven high potential to improve risk stratification. Currently, wall stress analysis of AAAs is based on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging; however, three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) has great advantages over CT and magnetic resonance imaging in terms of costs, speed, and lack of radiation. In this study, the feasibility of 3D US as input for wall stress analysis is investigated. Second, 3D US-based wall stress analysis was compared with CT-based results., METHODS: The 3D US and CT data were acquired in 12 patients (diameter, 35-90 mm). US data were segmented manually and compared with automatically acquired CT geometries by calculating the similarity index and Hausdorff distance. Wall stresses were simulated at P = 140 mm Hg and compared between both modalities., RESULTS: The similarity index of US vs CT was 0.75 to 0.91 (n = 12), with a median Hausdorff distance ranging from 4.8 to 13.9 mm, with the higher values found at the proximal and distal sides of the AAA. Wall stresses were in accordance with literature, and a good agreement was found between US- and CT-based median stresses and interquartile stresses, which was confirmed by Bland-Altman and regression analysis (n = 8). Wall stresses based on US were typically higher (+23%), caused by geometric irregularities due to the registration of several 3D volumes and manual segmentation. In future work, an automated US registration and segmentation approach is the essential point of improvement before pursuing large-scale patient studies., CONCLUSIONS: This study is a first step toward US-based wall stress analysis, which would be the modality of choice to monitor wall stress development over time because no ionizing radiation and contrast material are involved.

843,"Preoperative downstaging chemoradiation with concurrent irinotecan and capecitabine in MRI-defined locally advanced rectal cancer: A phase i trial (NWCOG-2) Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation using radiotherapy (RT) combined with concurrent capecitabine and irinotecan for locally advanced rectal cancer before surgery. Method(s):Forty-six patients were recruited and treated on the basis that MRI scanning had shown poor-risk tumours with threatening (1 mm) or involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Conformal RT was given using 3 or 4 fields at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 days per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. Concurrently oral capecitabine was given twice daily throughout radiotherapy continuously from days 1 to 35 and intravenous irinotecan was given once per week during weeks 1 to 4 of RT. Dose levels were gradually escalated as follows. Dose level 1: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 50 mg m 2; Dose level 2: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 3: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 4: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 70 mg m 2. Result(s):Diarrhoea (grade 3, no grade 4) was the main serious acute toxicity with lesser degrees of fatigue, neutropenia, anorexia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The recommended dose for future study was dose level 2 at which 3 of 14 patients (21%) developed grade 3 diarrhoea. Postoperative complications included seven pelvic or wound infections and two anastomotic and two perineal wound dehiscences. There were no deaths in the first 30 days postoperatively. Of 41 resected specimens, 11 (27%) showed a pathological complete response (pCR) and five (12%) showed an involved circumferential resection margin (defined as 1 mm). The 3-year disease-free survival (intent-to-treat) was 53.2%. Conclusion(s):In patients with poor-risk MRI-defined locally advanced rectal cancer threatening or involving the mesorectal fascia, preoperative chemoradiation based on RT at 45 Gy in 25 daily fractions over 5 weeks with continuous daily oral capecitabine at 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. days 1-35 and weekly IV irinotecan at 60 mg m 2 weeks 1-4, provides acceptable acute toxicity and postoperative morbidity with encouraging response and curative resection rates. © 2009 Cancer Research UK.",Excluded
591,"Predictors of pulmonary toxicity in limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 70Gy daily radiotherapy: CALGB 30904 Introduction: Standard therapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (L-SCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. Predictors of post chemoradiotherapy pulmonary toxicity in limited stage (LS) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients are not well defined. Current guidelines are derived from non-small cell lung cancer regimens, and do not account for the unique biology of this disease. Therefore, we analyzed patients on three consecutive CALGB LS-SCLC trials treated with concurrent chemotherapy and daily high dose radiotherapy (70. Gy) to determine patient and treatment related factors predicting for post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Method(s): Patients treated on CALGB protocols 39808, 30002, 30206 investigating two cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and 70. Gy daily thoracic radiation therapy were pooled. Patient, tumor, and treatment related factors were evaluated to determine predictors of grade 3-5 pulmonary toxicities after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): 100 patients were included. No patient experienced grade 4-5 post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Patients who experienced post-treatment pulmonary toxicity were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs 60, p= 0.09) and have smaller total lung volumes (2565 cc vs 3530 cc, p= 0.05).). Furthermore, exposure of larger volumes of lung to lower (median V5. = 70%, p= 0.09, median V10. = 63%, p= 0.07), intermediate (median V20. = 50, p= 0.04) and high (median V60. = 25%, p= 0.01) doses of radiation were all associated with post-treatment grade 3 pulmonary toxicity, as was a larger mean lung radiation dose (median 31.

3390,"Long-term pain outcomes for recurrent idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia after stereotactic radiosurgery: A prospective comparison of first-time microvascular decompression and repeat stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Microvascular decompression (MVD) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Many patients who receive SRS have pain recurrence; the ideal second intervention is unknown. The authors directly compared pain outcomes after MVD and repeat SRS in a population of patients in whom SRS failed as their first-line procedure for TN, and they identified predictors of pain control. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing surgery for TN between 1997 and 2014 at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Standardized data collection focused on preoperative clinical characteristics, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes. Patients with typical type 1, idiopathic TN with >= 1 year of follow-up were included. RESULTS In total, 168 patients underwent SRS as their first procedure. Of these patients, 90 had residual or recurrent pain. Thirty of these patients underwent a second procedure at UCSF and had >= 1 year of follow-up; 15 underwent first-time MVD and 15 underwent repeat SRS. Patients undergoing MVD were younger than those receiving repeat SRS and were more likely to receive >= 80 Gy during the initial SRS. The average follow-up was 44.9 +/- 33.6 months for MVD and 48.3 +/- 45.3 months for SRS. All patients achieved complete pain freedom without medication at some point during their follow-up. At last follow-up, 80% of MVD-treated patients and 33.3% of SRS-treated patients had a favorable outcome, defined as Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity scores of I-IIIa (p < 0.05). Percentages of patients with favorable outcome at 1 and 5 years were 86% and 75% for the MVD cohort and 73% and 27% for the SRS cohort, respectively (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that performing MVD was statistically significantly associated with favorable outcome (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.60, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant predictors of favorable outcome in the MVD cohort; however, the presence of sensory changes after repeat SRS was associated with pain relief (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Patients who received MVD after failed SRS had a longer duration of favorable outcome compared to those who received repeat SRS; however, both modalities are safe and effective. The presence of post-SRS sensory changes was predictive of a favorable pain outcome in the SRS cohort.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Excluded
945,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity.",Included

(FAC) and their protective mechanism against radiation damage. FAC increased the survival rate of mice and made the damaged organ injured by 60Co gamma-irradiation recovered to normal appearance with the mechanism of enhancing immune function and blood-producing function in vivo. The molecule mechanism of FAC against radiation is involved in the reduction of DNA injury and mutation in vitro. Eleven monomers of the FAC were analyzed by HPLC. These results seem to support the use of FAC in relieving radiation damage. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,Excluded
120,"Individualizing cancer treatment: biological optimization models in treatment planning and delivery PURPOSE: During the last 30 years radiation therapy has developed from classical rectangular beams via conformation therapy with largely uniform dose delivery, but irregular field shapes, to fully intensity modulated dose delivery where the total dose distribution in the tumor can be fully controlled in three dimensions. This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity., RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed., CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept.",Excluded

Previous studies provide some data to show that the amount of sunscreen applied is less than manufacturers' recommendations, although studies have often used indirect measurement techniques. This study comprised 50 volunteers who applied a standard aqueous cream as a hypoallergenic analogue for sunscreen to one of their forearms. Two novel methods of directly measuring forearm area were used, based on a mathematical model and the use of a helically wrapped cloth belt. Application amounts ranged from 0.05 mg.cm-2 to 8.38 mg.cm-2. The distribution was heavily skewed, with a modal value in the range 0.5-1.0 mg.cm-2. Of the volunteers 69% applied less than the generally accepted quantity of 2.0 mg.cm-2, with 61% applying less than 1.5 mg.cm-2, and 37% applying less than 1.0 mg.cm-2. The study confirms previous findings that most sunscreen application is not sufficient to achieve the stated sun protection factor. The use of higher factor sunscreens, a reassessment of the definition of sun protection factors and/or further public education campaigns are warranted.",Excluded

2863,"Radioprotective effects of exogenous glutathione against whole-body gamma-ray irradiation: age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in rat liver Age- and gender-related changes in malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in rat livers exposed to different doses of whole-body gamma-ray radiation were determined. In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included
657,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included

498,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions.

3024,"Cardiac-CTand transoesophageal echocardiography comparison for left atrial appendage clots detection in patients referred for left atrial interventional procedures Introduction: Left atrial appendage (LAA) was identified as a main location of clots formation (91% in non-valvular AF), and it is related with stroke and systemic embolic events. Presence of LAA clots is a contraindication to left atrial interventional procedures as pulmonary veins isolation or LAA percutaneous closure. Transoeophageal echocardiography (TEE) is the gold standard technique for exclude LAA clots, but other imaging modalities are emerging for this indication. Our aim was compare TEE and CT diagnostic performance for exclude LAA thrombus in patients referred for left atrium interventional procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients studied with TEE (Philips EPIQ-7) and CT (Philips iCT-256) previous LAA percutaneous closure or pulmonary vein isolation procedures between May/2015 and May/2016 were included. LAA was studied with TTE in mid-esophageal views at 0degree, 45degree, 90degree, 135degree. LAA clot, spontaneous echo-contrast and low LAA velocities were assessed with TEE. CT was performed in two-phase scan (early arterial and venous phase with 70-90 sec delay), for detect filling defects in one or both phases. Result(s): 52 patients were included (67+/-15 years, 75% male). Main structural values were LV ejection fraction 57+/-11%, LA indexed volume 84 ml/m2, atrial fibrillation prevalence 46%. Procedure indication was 50% for LAA closure and 50% for pulmonary veins isolation. TEE detected 1.9% LAA clot (one patient), spontaneous echo-contrast 17,3% and low LAA velocities at 9.6%. Assessment with CT detected 1.9% LAA clot (1 case) and arterial defect at 17.3%. LAA clots cases are no coincident between both techniques (Pearson 0.02 p-value 0.889). Spontaneous echo-contrast was detected in 9 patients with TEE, 6 of them had arterial defect also at CT. On the other hand, arterial defect was detected at 9 with CT, 6 of them with spontaneous echo-contrast at TEE (Pearson 0.595 p-value <0.001). After comparison between indications there were differences in LAA defects prevalence. Previous LAA closure, TEE and CT detected thrombus at 3.8% (1 case) but are no coincident. TEE prevalence of spontaneous echo-contrast 30.8% and low flow velocity 19.2%; while with CT arterial defect 30.8% (Pearson 0.632 p-value 0-001). Previous pulmonary vein isolation TEE no detected any LAA defects and CT detected arterial defect but not at venous phase in one patient. Security data related with CT were 75 ml average of ionidated contrast (Visipaque 320mg), and a mean of radiation dose of 4.4 mSv. Conclusion(s): In our sample, LAA clots had a low prevalence. Both techniques detected a clot which it was no detected by the other modality. Instead, assessment of spontaneous echo-contrast or arterial defects had a moderate diagnostic correlation. A combined strategy with both techniques could improve the accuracy of LAA thrombus exclusion, especially in patients with LAA closure indication.",Excluded

All patients received either preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy., SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral center., INTERVENTIONS: Fourteen patients had mandibular continuity restored by using the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system, and 1 patient received a stainless steel mandibular reconstruction plate. Associated soft-tissue defects were repaired by using radial forearm (n = 11), rectus abdominis (n = 2), scapular and parascapular (n = 1), or lateral arm (n = 1) free flaps., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Early and delayed complications., RESULTS: All 15 microvascular free tissue transfers were successful. Early complications were minor and occurred in 5 (33%) of 15 patients. One patient in whom the titanium hollow screw reconstruction plate system had been used experienced a fracture at 15 months after reconstruction. Three patients experienced delayed external plate exposure between 7 and 15 months after primary oromandibular reconstruction. Patients who experienced delayed external plate exposure required secondary reconstruction with a vascularized bone-containing free flap. The overall rate of delayed reconstructive failure was 40% in patients who were followed up for a minimum of 1 year., CONCLUSIONS: For patients who are undergoing free flap reconstruction of lateral mandibulectomy defects, the technique that used soft-tissue free flaps combined with mandibular reconstruction plates has been abandoned in favor of using vascularized bone-containing free flaps or a combination of free flaps to achieve optimal long-term results.",Excluded
861,"Different trend for changing of mammalian plasma (serum) antioxidant activity after irradiation at large and low-doses One of the path for research of antioxidant status in vivo is the determination of blood plasma (serum) antioxidant activity (AOA). AOA is an integral parameter for the contribution of different antiradical defense components which particular nomenclature is determined by a used method of definition. In the present work AOA is studied with usage of a system of suppression in vitro by blood plasma (serum) of a Fe(2+)-induced oxidation of a substrate from egg yolk lipoproteins. The contribution of separate components of a blood plasma to an integral index of AOA for human blood serum is studied. Urine acid, albumin, reduced glutathione, ascorbat, heparin, peroxidase and catalase had no activity.

3207,"Definition of an optimal model based on segments' contribution for the estimation of the acceleration of the center of mass in people with lower-limb amputation Introduction In the context of rehabilitation of people with amputation, gait analysis provides information about gait alterations. In that perspective, the body center of mass (BCoM) trajectory, or its derivatives, can be used to describe how the whole body moves (Cavagna and Kaneko 1977). It is generally obtained using force plates or an optical motion capture system (OMC). However, these instruments are constrained to laboratory use. Magneto-Inertial measurement units (MIMUs) are wearable sensors that allow BCoM kinematics assessment in every-day life conditions (Pavei et al. 2020): first, the BCoM acceleration can be obtained from a weighted average of segments' center of mass (sCoM) accelerations, using MIMUs located on the segments, and then, the BCoM trajectory is estimated by integration of the obtained acceleration. Finding a balance between a limited number of sensors and good accuracy is crucial. In this respect, Shahabpoor et al. (2018) recently proposed a method to select a reduced number of MIMUs for the estimation of the 3D BCoM acceleration. However, the methodology was not applied in people with lower-limb amputation. This study aims at filling this gap. First, the most appropriate segments to include in the model are identified, then the accuracy of models based on different combinations of these segments was assessed using OMC data. 2. Methods 2.1. Experimental method The study was approved by the local ethical committee and 8 transfemoral amputees (6 males, 2 females, age: 40.8 +/- 12.6 years, mass: 70.8 +/- 17.5 kg) gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. According to the methodology reported in Al Abiad et al. (2020), the 3D trajectory of 59 reflective markers located on patients' anatomical landmarks were acquired with OMC during walking, and combined with static EOS-based biplanar x-rays acquisition. 2.2. Data processing A 15-segments hybrid inertial model constructed according to Al Abiad et al. (2020), was used to obtain sCoM inertial parameters. sCoM accelerations were obtained from OMC, and reference BCoM acceleration was obtained using the abovementioned inertial model. The contribution of each segment in the BCoM acceleration was defined as the acceleration of the sCoM, weighted by the relative mass of the segment in the body (1) Then, for each subject, Pearson's cross-correlations of sCoM accelerations were computed for each pair of segments and between each sCoM and BCoM accelerations over a complete gait cycle, for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML) and vertical (V) directions. For each direction, the cross-correlation matrices were averaged over all subjects. These steps allowed to define the most relevant contributing segments to the BCoM acceleration to construct a MIMUs-based experimental model with a minimal number of segments (MiNuM model). The mass of the non-selected segments was attributed to the main contributors based on sCoM accelerations cross-correlations (Shahabpoor et al. 2018). MiNuM models were validated against the reference BCoM using a leave-one-out methodology. Reference and MiNuM-based BCoM accelerations were compared over the central prosthetic gait cycle of each trial using Pearson's correlation coefficients and peak-to-peak normalized root-mean square errors (NRMSE), averaged over all patients. 3. Results and discussion A total of 22 gait cycles were analysed for the 8 participants. Trunk, pelvis, both thighs and both feet were considered as the best sensor locations to be considered (Figure 1). Finally, different MiNuM models were built (see 'Segment included' column in Table 1). Leave-one-out validation results are summarized in Table 1. The optimal MiNuM model for transfemoral amputees is based on 5 segments, i.e., trunk, both thighs and both feet. Indeed, it presented results similar to improved compared to those presented in Shahabpoor et al. (2018) in healthy subjects using the 3-sensor configuration (16%, 7%, 18% in AP, V, ML respectively) and provided a good compromise between accuracy and reduced number of sensors. 4. Conclusions This study allowed to obtain insight on the best location of sensors for 3D BCoM acceleration estimation in people with transfemoral amputation. It is worth to underline that the achieved results rely on the localization of sCoM using EOS imaging and were obtained using acceleration data derived from OMC markers. When using MIMUs, one may be confronted with additional sources of errors such as softtissue artefacts that could affect the obtained results. Therefore, the accuracy obtained using actual MIMUs as well as methodologies to correctly identify MIMU positions relative to the sCoM represent research tracks of interest.",Excluded
3375,"177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor and a single functioning kidney: Tolerability and effect on renal function Our objective was to assess the renal toxicity profile of 177Lu- DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in patients with a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and a single functioning kidney. Method(s): This was a retrospective analysis of NET patients who had undergone 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT at a large tertiary-care center. All patients selected for the study had somatostatin receptor-positive NETs, had received at least 3 cycles of 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, and had a documented single functioning kidney. The analyzed parameters included patient characteristics, metastatic burden, renal characteristics at diagnosis and during therapy, and nephrotoxic factors. For the renal assessment, the following characteristics were studied before each PRRT cycle: glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as estimated by 99mTcdiethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid renography, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) as measured by 99mTc-ethylenedicysteine renography, and blood urea and serum creatinine levels. Renal toxicity was evaluated using version 4.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE score). The percentage reduction in GFR and ERPF was also assessed. Filtration fraction was calculated to clarify whether there was a relatively greater reduction in one index of renal function than in the other. Result(s): At the time of analysis, 6 patients met the inclusion criteria, having received between 3 and 5 cycles of therapy with a cumulative activity of 16.6-36.2 GBq. The duration of follow-up ranged from 12 to 56 mo. The overall toxicity profile (as per the NCI-CTCAE score) showed no acute renal toxicity in any patient. Regarding overall chronic renal toxicity, 3 patients had none, 1 patient had grade II, and 2 patients had grade I. All patients with overall chronic renal toxicity showed compromised renal function at the outset (baseline). The 2 patients with grade I chronic renal toxicity after PRRT had grade II at baseline and gradual improvement over the subsequent cycles. One patient with grade II at baseline showed transient worsening to grade III after the first cycle followed by gradual improvement and a return to baseline after the second cycle. Only 2 patients showed a reduction in GFR (5.3% in one and 13.84% in the other). Four patients showed a reduction in ERPF (31.4% in the patient with the greatest reduction), and all had a rise in filtration fraction signifying that tubular parameters were more affected than glomerular parameters. Conclusion(s): With proper renal protection and dose fractionation, it is feasible to use 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with NET and a single functioning kidney. Further studies are required to assess the long-term renal consequences of changes in ERPF and filtration fraction in these patients.Copyright © 2016 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy failed to improve either.Copyright © 2015 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
2787,"Developmental defects and male sterility in mice lacking the ubiquitin-like DNA repair gene mHR23B mHR23B encodes one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23, a ubiquitin-like fusion protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Part of mHR23B is complexed with the XPC protein, and this heterodimer functions as the main damage detector and initiator of global genome NER. While XPC defects exist in humans and mice, mutations for mHR23A and mHR23B are not known. Here, we present a mouse model for mHR23B. Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.",Excluded

Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included
201,"Gastrointestinal hemorrhage after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer Background/Aims: While chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is considered to be a reasonable treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC), there is little information about the associated risk of gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage. We investigated the clinical features of GI toxicity after CRT in patients with LAPC and examined the effect of GI hemorrhage on survival. Method(s): Patients enrolled in this study had received CRT for pathologically proven LAPC. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): A total of 156 patients with LAPC (median age, 65 years; range, 39 to 90 years) who received treatment between August 2005 and March 2009 were included in this study. The most common GI toxicities were ulcer formation (25.6%) and hemorrhage (25.6%), and the most common grade 3 to grade 5 GI toxicity was hemorrhage (65%). The origins of GI hemorrhage were gastric ulcer (37.5%), duodenal ulcer (37.5%), and radiation gastritis (15.0%). The independent risk factor for GI hemorrhage was tumor location in the pancreatic body. The median overall survival of the patients with a GI hemorrhage was 13.8 months (range, 2.8 to 50.8 months) and was not significantly different from that of patients without GI hemorrhage. Conclusion(s): GI hemorrhage was common in patients with LAPC after CRT. Although GI hemorrhage was controlled with endoscopic hemostasis, preventive measures should be investigated to reduce needless suffering.",Excluded
2439,"Accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy combined with induction and concomitant chemotherapy for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: Impact of total treatment time Tumour cell proliferation during conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) can negatively influence the treatment outcome in patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accelerated and hyperfractionated RT may therefore have an advantage over conventional RT. Moreover, earlier studies have suggested improved survival with addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). We present here the results of combined treatment with induction and concomitant CT and accelerated hyperfractionated RT in a retrospective series of patients with advanced NSCLC. Between August 1990 and August 1995, 90 consecutive patients, aged 42-77 years (median 63 years), with locally advanced unresectable or medically inoperable NSCLC and good performance status were referred for treatment: stage: I 23%, IIIa 37%, IIIb 40%. Patients histologies included: squamous cell carcinoma 52%, adenocarcinoma 34% and large cell carcinoma 13%. The treatment consisted of two courses of CT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1- 3 i.v.), the second course given concomitantly with RT. The total RT dose was 61.2-64.6 Gy, with two daily fractions of 1.7 Gy. A one-week interval was introduced after 40.8 Gy to reduce acute toxicity, making the total treatment time 4.5 weeks. Concerning toxicity, 33 patients had febrile neutropenia, 10 patients suffered from grade III oesophagitis and 7 patients had grade III pneumonitis. There were two possible treatment-related deaths, one due to myocardial infarction and the other due to a pneumocystis carinii infection. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 72%, 46% and 34%, respectively; median survival was 21.3 months. Fifty-one patients had progressive disease: 21 failed locoregionally, 29 had distant metastases and 9 patients had a combination of these. Pretreatment weight loss was the only prognostic factor found, except for stage. However, the results for stage IIIb were no different from those for stage IIIa. We conclude that the survival results compare favourably with those of most other studies with a manageable toxicity.",Excluded
1797,"Assessment of ocular exposure to ultraviolet-B for population studies. Salisbury Eye Evaluation Project Team We have developed an empirical model with which to estimate the ocular exposure in the UVB wavelength band. This model incorporates aspects of personal behavior, geographic location, season and wavelength that have been developed from population-based data. This model, in conjunction with job history interviews, allows the estimate of cumulative exposures from age 30 in our population-based study. We present data on average annual exposure by age, gender, race, education and reported photophobia. The exposures in the general population are considerably lower than exposures reported in previous works based on occupational groups. There is a statistically significant difference between males and females, with females having lower exposures. African-Americans have median exposures similar to whites. Exposures decrease with education and with reported photophobia. These data provide the basis for characterizing lifetime exposure for the general population. The variability of exposure is much greater than found in occupational groups and includes numbers in the lowest exposure. The model should permit determination of a dose-response relationship with eye disease, even to the lower dose ranges.",Excluded
1848,"Staying in bed to benefit ESA's astronauts and Europe's citizens Since Yuri Gagarin's historic first flight into space in April 1961, it has quickly become evident that the space environment influences the human body in many different ways and causes it to adapt in ways that can lead to problems when returning to Earth's gravity. Much research has been performed in the meantime and our understanding of what happens to our bodies in space improved considerably during the Mir space station and Space Shuttle/Spacelab era. However, many questions, particularly regarding how to counteract those changes that we now know take place, still need to be addressed through studies on the International Space Station (ISS) and through simulations on the ground. As we enter an era in which crews will spend longer periods in space on the ISS and of longer term plans by almost every space-faring nation for missions to Mars, it is clear that much more knowledge is needed, and quickly. Although a few hundred men and women have already travelled into space, the operating environment severely limits the amount of systematic research that can be performed--a situation that is unlikely to change. Other avenues for addressing specific scientific questions in a controlled research environment must therefore be found. One of these complementary alternatives is head-down-tilt bed-rest studies in which volunteers are confined to beds that are tilted -6 deg below the horizontal at the head end. Every activity, including eating, reading, showering, etc., is performed in this position for the duration of the study. This leads to changes in the human body that are very similar to those seen during spaceflight, such as bone-mass and muscle-mass loss, cardiovascular and neuro-sensory deconditioning. The controlled bed-rest setting therefore allows meaningful research into the bodily consequences of spaceflight and possible countermeasures. It also gives the scientific community interested in space-related medical research more ready access to a clinical model. The benefits of these studies go far beyond their space application. Patients bed-ridden because of illness or accidents suffer the same symptoms and can thus also profit from the studies. As a clear indication of this link, the clinicians and researchers involved in the bed-rest campaigns typically spend the majority of their time exploring ""terrestrial"" problems.",Excluded
165,"Abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): proof of principle in an experimental model of colon cancer The aim of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3. The present study performed in a simple animal model provides proof of principle that the positive response of a tumor to BNCT is capable of inducing an abscopal effect.",Excluded
2928,"Prediction of coronary artery calcium progression in individuals with low Framingham Risk Score: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether novel markers not involving ionizing radiation could predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression in a low-risk population., BACKGROUND: Increase in CAC scores over time (CAC progression) improves prediction of coronary heart disease (CHD) events. Due to radiation exposure, CAC measurement represents an undesirable method for repeated risk assessment, particularly in individuals with low predicted risk (Framingham Risk Score [FRS] <10%)., METHODS: From 6,814 participants in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), 2,620 individuals were classified as low risk for CHD events (FRS <10%) and had follow-up CAC measurement. In addition to traditional risk factors (RFs), various combinations of novel marker models were selected on the basis of data-driven, clinical, or backward stepwise selection techniques., RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 2.5 years. CAC progression occurred in 574 participants (22% overall; 214 of 1,830 with baseline CAC = 0 and 360 of 790 with baseline CAC >0). Addition of various combinations of novel markers to the base model (c statistic = 0.711) revealed improvements in discrimination of approximately only 0.005 each (c statistics 0.7158, 0.7160, and 0.7164) for the best-fit models. All 3 best-fit novel marker models calibrated well but were similar to the base model in predicting individual risk probabilities for CAC progression. The highest prevalence of CAC progression occurred in the highest compared with the lowest probability quartile groups (39.2% to 40.3% vs. 6.4% to 7.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: In individuals at low predicted risk according to FRS, traditional risk factors predicted CAC progression in the short term with good discrimination and calibration. Prediction improved minimally when various novel markers were added to the model. Copyright A© 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1902,"Lung Cancer Screening with Low-Dose CT: Baseline Screening Results in Shanghai OBJECTIVE: To report the initial baseline lung cancer screening results with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) in a multicenter study in Shanghai., METHODS: A total of 14,506 subjects underwent LDCT lung cancer screening and completed questionnaires consisting of 13 risk factors for lung cancer in the prospective study. The positive result was defined as any size and density nodule. The nodules were classified into calcified, solid, part-solid, and nonsolid nodules. The positive rate and incidental detection rate of lung cancer and stage I lung cancer were calculated. The proportion of lung nodule and lung cancer with different density and size was analyzed., RESULTS: The positive rate and incidental detection rate of lung cancer was 29.89% and 1.23%, respectively. The incidental detection rate of stage I lung cancer was 0.97%. The proportion of lung cancer in lung nodules and stage I in lung cancer was 3.48% and 81.09%, respectively. The ratio of nonsolid nodule, part-solid nodule, and solid nodule in lung cancer was 52.94%, 31.93%, and 15.13%, respectively. 74.88% lung nodules were less than 5 mm and 94.12% lung cancers were larger than 5mm in size., CONCLUSION: The baseline LDCT lung cancer screening showed subsolid nodules accounted for the majority of lung cancer, and 5 mm in size would be recommended as the positive result threshold.

752,"Randomized trial of 90Sr/90Y beta-radiation versus placebo control for treatment of in-stent restenosis BACKGROUND: After conventional treatment of in-stent restenosis, the incidence of recurrent clinical restenosis may approach 40%. We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015). The incidence of the composite including death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization was observed in 60 (28.7%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 44 (19.1%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.024). Binary 8-month angiographic restenosis (> or =50% diameter stenosis) within the entire segment treated with radiation was reduced from 45.2% in the placebo-treated patients to 28.8% in the 90Sr/90Y-treated patients (P=0.001). Stent thromboses occurred in 1 patient assigned to placebo <24 hours after the procedure and in 1 patient assigned to 90Sr/90Y at day 244., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that beta-radiation using 90Sr/90Y is both safe and effective for preventing recurrence in patients with in-stent restenosis.",Included
2556,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included

A preliminary report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02 BACKGROUND: The third and final randomization of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 83-02 was performed to identify the maximal tolerated dose and potential efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in 1.6 Gy twice-daily fractions for adult malignant glioma., METHODS: From December 1987 to July 1989, 304 patients with malignant glioma were stratified by age, performance status, and histologic findings and randomized to receive total AHRT doses of 48.0 or 54.4 Gy, with 80 mg/m2 of bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) for 3 days every 8 weeks. Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded

There is an inverse relationship between fluoroscopy time and endoscopist experience. Objective(s): To determine the relationship between the technical difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla, and time to perform the procedure and fluoroscopy time. Method(s): Patients scheduled for ERCP were divided in two groups depending on the degree of difficulty of the process according to Schutz classification: group A (grades 1-3) and group B (grades 4 and 5). We registered demographic variables, reference diagnosis, endoscopic and radiological diagnoses, degree of difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla (Freeman scale), duration of procedure, fluoroscopy time and endoscopic complications. Result(s): 213 patients were included: 101 in group A and 112 in group B. Mean fluoroscopy time was 59.15 seconds in group A and 93.59 seconds in group B (p <0.0001). Mean time to perform the procedure was 13.18 minutes in group A and 20.23 minutes in group B (p <0.0001). Factors related to increased fluoroscopy time were technical difficulty for the CPE according to Schutz (p <0.0001), stent placement (p = 0.021) and hydrostatic dilation (p <0.0001).

930,"Quantification of coronary artery calcium on the basis of dual-energy coronary CT angiography PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using virtual noncontrast material-enhanced (VNC) computed tomographic (CT) series derived from dual-energy CT imaging studies for coronary artery calcium quantification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved; all patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

The aims of this study were to: (a) analyze sialoliths ultrastructurally, and to determine the role of foreign bodies or organic materials in the formation of sialolith nuclei; and (b) compare nephroliths with sialoliths ultrastructurally., METHODS: Three sialoliths and two nephroliths were analyzed ultrastructurally by a scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffractometer., RESULTS: The main structures of the sialoliths were found to be hydroxyapatite crystals. No organic cores were observed in the central parts of the sialoliths. In nephroliths, calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate, and struvite crystals were found. The energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis found that sialoliths and nephroliths were predominantly composed of elements comprising calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, sodium, chloride, silicon, iron, and potassium., CONCLUSION: Sialoliths in the submandibular salivary glands might form secondary to sialadenitis, but not via a luminal organic nidus.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
1392,"Does the effectiveness of recanalisation of chronic occlusion depend on the location of the obstruction? Aims: Reports concerning the efficacy of recanalisation of chronic coronary total occlusion (CTO) depending on occlusion site are inconsistent. Some of them indicate a lower effectiveness of recanalisation of the circumflex artery (Cx). Methods and Results: Between January 2011 and February 2015, 252 CTO procedures in 242 patients were performed. Characteristics of the occlusions, the procedures performed and the effectiveness of revascularisation among various coronary arteries were compared. In the study group, most of the patients were men - 201 (83.1%) - and 41 (16.9%) were women. The average age was 62.4+/-9.3 years. The incidence of the risk factors was: hypertension - 86.8% (n=211), hypercholesterolaemia - 99.1% (n=241), diabetes - 29.2% (n=71), smoking - 20.6% (n=50) and history of smoking - 58.0% (n=141). The artery most often opened was the right coronary artery (RCA) - 49.0% (n=125), followed by the left anterior descending (LAD) 32.9% (n=84) and the circumflex branch 18.1% (n=46). There were no differences in the duration of the occlusions among subsequent arteries. There was a difference in length of occlusion (mm): RCA - 30.5+/-13.5, LAD - 25.5+/-9.9, Cx - 20.2+/-8.3 (p<0.05 for all changes). J-CTO score for each coronary artery was as follows: 0 - 10.9% LAD (n=9) 23.9% Cx (n=11), 11.0% RCA (n=14); 1 - 31.7% LAD (n=26), 45.6% Cx (n=21), 22.8% RCA (n=29); 2 - LAD 37.8% (n=31), 19.6% Cx (n=9), 38.5% RCA (n=49); >=3 - LAD 19.5% (n=16), 10.9% Cx (n=5), 27.5% RCA (n=34). Mean J-CTO score for LAD was 2.19+/-0.95, for Cx 2.13+/-1.14, and for RCA 2.29+/-1.07 (p=NS between arteries). The longest procedure time of the revascularisation was PCI of the RCA (77.1+/-34.9 min, p<0.05 relative to the remaining vessels). Procedure time between the LAD (65.9+/-28.8 min) and the Cx (56.6+/-26 8 min) did not differ significantly. Fluoroscopy time was also the longest during PCI of the RCA (31.0+/-19.2 min, p<0.005 relative to other arteries), and did not differ between Cx (20.0+/-12.2 min) and LAD (25.3+/-16.8 min). There was no difference in the radiation dose (Gy): 2.5+/-1.7 vs. 2.2+/-1.3 vs. 2.5+/-1.3 (RCA, Cx and LAD, respectively) among vessels. The volume of contrast was similar during PCI of the RCA and LAD (365.8+/-161.6 vs. 371.3+/-149.4 mL, p=NS) and was significantly higher in comparison to PCI of the Cx (279.6+/-150.9 mL). The reverse technique (retrograde) was used most frequently during PCI of the RCA (30.4%, n=38), then LAD (19.1%, n=16) and significantly less during PCI of the Cx (4.4%, n=2). The number of implanted stents was significantly higher in PCI of the RCA (1.9+/-0.8) and did not differ between the LAD (1.3+/-0.6) and Cx (1.1+/-0.4). There was no difference in the incidence of complications depending on the artery opened: there was 1 stroke and 1 myocardial infarction during PCI of the RCA and 2 smaller perforations during PCI of the LAD and Cx. One tamponade was observed during PCI of the RCA. Efficacy of recanalisation was similar for all of the arteries: 82.4% for the RCA (n=103), 84.5% for the LAD (n=71), and 91.3% for the Cx (n=46). Conclusion(s): The most common artery we revascularised was the right coronary artery. It was characterised by the longest length of occlusion and required the longest procedure time and fluoroscopy time. Furthermore, it required the highest amount of contrast medium and number of implanted stents. Nevertheless, the efficacy was similar for all vessels.",Excluded

Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included
3126,"Proctitis 1 week after stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer: Implications for clinical trial design Background: Proctitis following prostate cancer radiation therapy is a primary determinant of quality of life (QOL). While previous studies have assessed acute rectal morbidity at 1 month after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), little data exist on the prevalence and severity of rectal morbidity within the first week following treatment. This study reports the acute bowel morbidity 1 week following prostate SBRT. Material(s) and Method(s): Between May 2013 and August 2014, 103 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer were treated with 35-36.25 Gy in five fractions using robotic SBRT delivered on a prospective clinical trial. Bowel toxicity was graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAEv.4). Bowel QOL was assessed using the EPIC-26 questionnaire bowel domain at baseline, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Time-dependent changes in bowel symptoms were statistically compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Clinically significant change was assessed by the minimally important difference (MID) in EPIC score. This was defined as a change of 1/2 standard deviation (SD) from the baseline score. Result(s): One-hundred and three patients with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was 23%. There were no acute >= grade 3 bowel toxicities. EPIC bowel summary scores maximally declined at 1 week after SBRT (-13.9, p < 0.0001) before returning to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (+0.03, p = 0.94). Prior to treatment, 4.9% of men reported that their bowel bother was a moderate to big problem. This increased to 28.4% (p < 0.0001) 1 week after SBRT and returned to baseline at 3 months after SBRT (0.0%, p = 0.66). Only the bowel summary and bowel bother score declines at 1 week met the MID threshold for clinically significant change. Conclusion(s): The rate and severity of acute proctitis following prostate SBRT peaked at 1 week after treatment and returned to baseline by 3 months. Toxicity assessment at 1 week can therefore minimize recall bias and should aid in the design of future clinical trials focused on accurately capturing and minimizing acute morbidity following SBRT.Copyright © 2016 Paydar, Cyr, Yung, Lei, Collins, Chen, Suy, Dritschilo, Lynch and Collins.",Excluded

The authors adjusted for smoking, and radon was associated with lung cancer risk among men: compared with a radon level of < 40 becquerels (Bq) per cubic meter (m3), the odds ratios for 40-76 Bq/m3, 77-139 Bq/m3, 140-199 Bq/m3, and 200+ Bq/m3 were 2.1, 2.0, 2.7, and 1.4, respectively. The association between radon and lung cancer, as determined with a multiplicative model, was found only among male smokers.",Included
2637,"Residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemoradiation outside the radiation therapy target volume: A new prognostic factor for survival in esophageal cancer Purpose/Objective(s) The aim of this study was to analyze the accuracy of gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation and clinical target volume (CTV) margins for neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (neo-CRT) in esophageal carcinoma at pathologic examination and to determine the impact on survival. Methods and Materials The study population consisted of 63 esophageal cancer patients treated with neo-CRT. GTV and CTV borders were demarcated in situ during surgery on the esophagus, using anatomical reference points to provide accurate information regarding tumor location at pathologic evaluation. To identify prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), a Cox regression analysis was performed. Results After resection, macroscopic residual tumor was found outside the GTV in 7 patients (11%). Microscopic residual tumor was located outside the CTV in 9 patients (14%). The median follow-up was 15.6 months. With multivariate analysis, only microscopic tumor outside the CTV (hazard ratio [HR], 4.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-15.36), and perineural growth (HR, 5.77; 95% CI, 1.27-26.13) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The 1-year OS was 20% for patients with tumor outside the CTV and 86% for those without (P<.01). For DFS, microscopic tumor outside the CTV (HR, 5.92; 95% CI, 1.89-18.54) and ypN+ (HR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.33-8.48) were identified as independent adverse prognostic factors. The 1-year DFS was 23% versus 77% for patients with or without tumor outside the CTV (P<.01). Conclusions Microscopic tumor outside the CTV is associated with markedly worse OS after neo-CRT. This may either stress the importance of accurate tumor delineation or reflect aggressive tumor behavior requiring new adjuvant treatment modalities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

1302,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

788,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included
1149,"A Novel Targeted Foraminoplasty Device Improves the Efficacy and Safety of Foraminoplasty in Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy: Preliminary Clinical Application of 70 Cases Objective: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy (PELD) has become a mature and mainstream surgical technique for treating lumbar disc herniation (LDH); however, there is a steep learning curve with PELD, especially for puncture and foraminoplasty. In this study, we assessed the outcome and safety of a novel quantificational and targeted foraminoplasty device named ZESSYS for LDH. Method(s): From September to December of 2016, 70 patients with symptomatic LDH were enrolled in the study. The patients were assigned randomly to either the ZESSYS group or the conventional TESSYS group. We recorded the cannula introduction time, decompression time, radiation exposure time, intraoperative pain feeling score, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Macnab criteria score of the 2 groups. The mean follow-up period was 14 months. Result(s): The average cannula introduction time (16.50 +/- 3.29 minutes) and the radiation exposure time (40.71 +/- 6.23 seconds) in the ZESSYS group were significantly reduced compared with the TESSYS group (cannula introduction time, 20.06 +/- 3.37 minutes, P = 0.000; radiation exposure time, 49.20 +/- 7.84 seconds, P = 0.000). Intraoperative pain feeling score in the ZESSYS group was significantly improved compared with the TESSYS group (P = 0.021). There were no significant differences between the 2 groups for decompression time (P = 0.617), Macnab criteria (P = 0.769), or visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at the same time point (P > 0.05). No serious complication was observed in any patients in either group. Conclusion(s): The novel targeted foraminoplasty technique with the specially designed double-cannulas is an effective and safe treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. It reduces the difficulty of PELD learning, minimizes radiation exposure, and decreases intraoperative pain associated with foraminoplasty.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2838,"Dosimetry-based treatment for Graves' disease Objective The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the long-Term outcome of a personalized dosimetry approach in Graves' disease aiming to render patients euthyroid from a planned thyroid absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients and methods A total of 284 patients with Graves' disease were followed prospectively following administration of radioiodine calculated to deliver an absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients with cardiac disease were excluded. Outcomes were analysed at yearly intervals for up to 10 years with a median follow-up of 37.5 months. Results A single radioiodine administration was sufficient to render a patient either euthyroid or hypothyroid in 175 (62%) patients, the remainder requiring further radioiodine. The median radioactivity required to deliver 60 Gy was 77 MBq. Less than 2% patients required 400-600 MBq, the standard activity administered in many centres. In the cohort receiving a single administration, 38, 32 and 26% were euthyroid on no specific thyroid medication at 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Larger thyroid volumes were associated with the need for further therapy. The presence of nodules on ultrasonography did not adversely affect treatment outcome. Conclusion A personalized dosimetric approach delayed the long-Term onset of hypothyroidism in 26% of patients. This was achieved using much lower administered activities than currently recommended. Future studies will aim to identify those patients who would benefit most from this approach.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
48,"The relationship between occupational radiation exposure and thyroid nodules Background: Considering that thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer occur more frequently in people chronically exposed to radiation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in staff members occupationally exposed to radiation was determined by ultrasonography. The results were compared with the results of another study among the adult population of Isfahan which selected by cluster random sampling method. The 2 studied groups were matched according to sex and age. Result(s): The case and control groups included 124 and 471 persons, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the case and control groups was 22.6% and 24.6%, respectively (p > 0.05). Although thyroid nodules were significantly more prevalent in females in the control group, no such difference was observed between females and males of the case group (p > 0.05). The number of thyroid nodules (single or multiple) and calcification were not different between the two groups (p > 0.05). In addition, hypoechogenicity of thyroid nodules was not different between the two groups for (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): In our study, there was not any correlation between chronic occupational exposure to low dose of radiation and the risk of developing thyroid nodules. Further studies with larger sample sizes, at different doses of radiation, and considering iodine status and thyroid function are thus required.",Included
915,"Effects of whole-body UVB irradiation on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from stage I melanoma patients Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes significant impairment of immunological function in human skin. The immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation are thought to be due to local release of cytokines by human keratinocytes, leading to impaired function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) and failure to induce cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recent studies have shown that individuals susceptible to UV-induced suppression of DTH may be more prone to develop skin cancer including malignant melanoma (MM). Since the causal relationship between UV radiation and the induction of MM still seems obscure, we investigated the immunological reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to whole-body irradiation with UVB in 15 stage I melanoma patients as compared to PBMC from normal volunteers matched for age, gender and skin type. Whole-body irradiation was performed with 0.8 minimal erythema dosages on five consecutive days. Peripheral blood was obtained before and after the procedure. Overall, there were no major effects of UVB irradiation on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and proliferation of PBMC from patients or normal controls, but UVB irradiation led to a significant increase in PWM-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-2R and TNF by PBMC. These changes were independent of the individual UVB dosages administered and appeared in both groups similarly. UVB irradiation did not lead to significant changes on IL-1 and IL-2 expression by PBMC. Our results suggest that PBMC participate in the cytokine response to UV, even in the absence of inflammatory reactions, but that this participation is not specific to MM patients.",Excluded

Patients' weight was recorded. On scout imaging, chest diameters were determined, and circumferences were calculated. To determine whether body weight showed sex-specific characteristics, t test was used. Pearson correlation determined whether cross-sectional measurements reflected female/male body habitus. On coronary imaging, contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the aorta and the coronaries were calculated. To assess whether CNRs differed throughout the diastolic phase, t test was used. Data triplets of CNRs and the corresponding current and circumference were plotted; CNRs less than 250 Hounsfield unit (HU) were discarded, dissecting lines as 95th percentiles correlating radiograph currents and patients' circumferences were calculated., RESULTS: Female/male weights differed significantly (P = 0.0006); circumferences based on scouts adequately reflected body weight (coefficients, 0.86 male/0.87 female). Homogenous vascular enhancement of the aorta (mean +/- SD, 344.4 +/- 81.8 HU) and the right (292.3 +/- 82.8 HU) and left (285.8 +/- 81.3 HU) coronaries was achieved (P > 0.005). Ninety-fifth percentile cutoffs identified linear relationships between patient's circumference and the minimal adequate radiograph current achieving CNR less than or equal to 250 HU., CONCLUSION: Scout imaging can be used to determine individual patient habitus; habitus-adjusted minimal radiograph tube current cutoff levels identified in this study ensuring clinically required levels of coronary enhancement can be used for future coronary CT angiography optimization of tube current based on scout imaging.",Excluded
2106,"Totally automatic definition of renal regions of interest from 99mTc-MAG3 renograms: validation in patients with normal kidneys and in patients with suspected renal obstruction INTRODUCTION: An image-processing algorithm (AUTOROI) has been developed to totally automatically (or with manual assistance) detect whole-kidney contours and generate renal regions of interest (ROI) for the extraction of the quantitative measurements used in the interpretation of Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-MAG3) renograms., METHODS: The 18-20th min dynamic frames post-MAG3 injection were used to automatically define boxes surrounding each kidney, which were then transposed to an early composite image for interpolative and directional background subtraction. Sobel operator and unsharp masking were applied for edge enhancement, and the resulting image histograms were equalized to better define poorly functioning kidneys. AUTOROI searched radially from the center of mass to define each kidney's ROI coordinates. AUTOROI was validated using MAG3 studies from 79 patients referred for suspected obstruction (79 left, 77 right kidneys) and 19 kidney donors with normal kidney function and no obstruction. Renal ROIs were manually defined by a nuclear medicine technologist with 20+ years of experience (reference standard) and an American Board of Nuclear Medicine certified physician. AUTOROI and physician ROIs were automatically compared with the reference standard to determine the border definition error., RESULTS: AUTOROI totally automatically detected the renal borders in 89% (172 of 194) of the kidneys from the entire group of 98 patients. The 22 kidneys missed automatically were subsequently detected with the assistance of a single manually placed fiducial point demarcating the liver/kidney boundary. These 22 kidneys were shown to be associated with markedly reduced MAG3 clearance. The mean error of AUTOROI for all 194 kidneys was 6.66+/-3.77 and 7.31+/-4.52 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. The physician's error was 6.78+/-2.42 and 6.65+/-2.05 mm for the left and right kidney, respectively. This error difference between AUTOROI and the physician was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: AUTOROI provides an objective and promising approach to automated renal ROI detection.",Excluded
438,"Hippocampal avoidance with volumetric modulated arc therapy in melanoma brain metastases - the first Australian experience PURPOSE: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can deliver intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) like dose distributions in a short time; this allows the expansion of IMRT treatments to palliative situations like brain metastases (BMs). VMAT can deliver whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to achieve stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for BMs. This study is an audit of our experience in the treatment of brain metastases with VMAT in our institution., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastases were volumetrically contoured on fused diagnostic gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI/planning CT images. Risk organs included hippocampus, optic nerve, optic chiasm, eye, and brain stem. The hippocampi were contoured manually as one paired organ with assistance from a neuroradiologist. WBRT and SIB were integrated into a single plan., RESULTS: Thirty patients with 73 BMs were treated between March 2010 and February 2012 with VMAT. Mean follow up time was 3.5 months. For 26 patients, BMs arose from primary melanoma and for the remaining four patients from non-small cell lung cancer (n= 2), primary breast cancer, and sarcoma. Mean age was 60 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Five patients were treated without hippocampal avoidance (HA) intent. The median WBRT dose was 31 Gy with a median SIB dose for BMs of 50 Gy, given over a median of 15 fractions. Mean values for BMs were as follows: GTV = 6.9 cc, PTV = 13.3 cc, conformity index = 8.6, homogeneity index = 1.06. Mean and maximum hippocampus dose was 20.4 Gy, and 32.4 Gy, respectively, in patients treated with HA intent. Mean VMAT treatment time from beam on to beam off for one fraction was 3.43 minutes, which compared to WBRT time of 1.3 minutes. Twenty out of 25 assessable lesions at the time of analysis were controlled. Treatment was well tolerated; grade 4 toxicity was reported in one patient. The median overall survival was 9.40 months, CONCLUSIONS: VMAT for BMs is feasible, safe and associated with a similar survival times and toxicities to conventional SRT+/-WBRT. The advantage of VMAT is that WBRT and SRT can be delivered at the same time on one machine.",Excluded
140,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001). Chromosomal translocations were more frequent with repeated CT-exposed patients than in CT-naive patients, and a positive dose-response relationship was present between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency.",Included
1872,"An ecological study of cancer incidence and radon levels in South West England To investigate the relationship of domestic radon levels and cancer, the incidence of 14 major cancers in Devon and Cornwall were examined in relation to the local radon levels.

The average radon levels for postcode sectors were sorted into ten categories from low (< 40 Bq/m3) to extremely high (> or = 230 Bq/m3) and age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for each radon category. The incidence rates for lung cancer, where radon has been claimed to be a risk factor, were very similar across all domestic radon categories. Only non-melanoma skin cancers, showed a significant increase in incidence in the high-radon postcode sectors (> or = 100 Bq/m3) compared with the low-radon sectors (< 60 Bq/m3) and this effect was observed for both sexes. The remaining 12 cancer sites showed no significant trend in incidence rates with increasing radon concentration.

2304,"Protection of radiation-induced damage to the hematopoietic system, small intestine and salivary glands in rats by JNJ7777120 compound, a histamine H4 ligand Based on previous data on the histamine radioprotective effect on highly radiosensitive tissues, in the present work we aimed at investigating the radioprotective potential of the H4R ligand, JNJ7777120, on ionizing radiation-induced injury and genotoxic damage in small intestine, salivary glands and hematopoietic tissue. For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included
287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included

1890,"Comparison of different cooling regimes within a shortened liquid cooling/warming garment on physiological and psychological comfort during exercise The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of different cooling regime intensities to maintain physiological and subjective comfort during physical exertion levels comparable to that engaged in during extravehicular activities (EVA) in space. We studied eight subjects (six males, two females) donned in our newly developed physiologically based shortened liquid cooling/warming garment (SLCWG). Rigorous (condition 1) and mild (condition 2) water temperature cooling regimes were compared at physical exertion levels comparable to that performed during EVA to ascertain the effectiveness of a lesser intensity of cooling in maintaining thermal comfort, thus reducing energy consumption in the portable life support system. Exercise intensity was varied across stages of the session. Finger temperature, rectal temperature, and subjective perception of overall body and hand comfort were assessed. Finger temperature was significantly higher in the rigorous cooling condition and showed a consistent increase across exercise stages, likely due to the restriction of heat extraction because of the intensive cold. In the mild cooling condition, finger temperature exhibited an overall decline with cooling, indicating greater heat extraction from the body. Rectal temperature was not significantly different between conditions, and showed a steady increase over exercise stages in both rigorous and mild cooling conditions. Ratings of overall comfort were 30% higher (more positive) and more stable in mild cooling (p<0.001). The mild cooling regime was more effective than rigorous cooling in allowing the process of heat exchange to occur, thus maintaining thermal homeostasis and subjective comfort during physical exertion.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): As a step in this direction, we have investigated the effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response in ex vivo-irradiated peripheral blood cells using microarray analysis. We also evaluated the ability of gene expression signatures to predict the radiation exposure level of ex vivo-exposed samples from smokers and non-smokers of both genders. Result(s): We identified eight genes with a radiation response that was significantly affected by smoking status, and confirmed an effect of smoking on the radiation response of the four and a half LIM domains 2 (FHL2) gene using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The performance of our previously defined 74-gene signature in predicting the radiation dose to samples in this study was unaffected by differences in gender or smoking status, however, giving 98% correct prediction of dose category. This is the same accuracy as that found in the original study from which the signature was derived, using different donors.

Of 116 patients treated with total tumour doses of 69.6 Gy, 1.2 Gy b.i.d. fractionation, 44 patients refused surgery while 72 patients were medically inoperable due to existing co-morbid states. Patients who were medically inoperable had worse KPS (P=0.0059) and more pronounced weight loss (P=0.0005). Among them, 12 patients experienced high-grade toxicity and 11 of them with either acute (n=6) or ""consequential"" late (n=5) high-grade toxicity requested interruption in the Hfx RT course (range, 12-25 days; median, 17 days). Superior survival (OS) was observed in patients who refused surgery when compared to those who were medically inoperable (P=0.0041), as well as superior local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (P=0.011), but not different distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.14). Cause-specific survival (CSS) also favoured patients who refused surgery (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis showed independent influence of the reason for not undergoing surgery on OS (P=0.035), but not on LRFS (P=0.084) or CSS (P=0.068). Patients who refused surgery did not experience high-grade toxicity (0/44), whereas 11 of 72 patients with medical inoperability and co-morbid states experienced high-grade toxicity and had treatment interruptions to manage toxicity (P=0.0064). Patients without treatment interruptions had significantly better OS (P=0.00000), LRFS (P=0.00000) and CSS (P=0.00000) than those with treatment interruptions. When corrected for treatment interruptions, the reason for not undergoing surgery independently influenced OS (P=0.040), but not LRFS (P=0.092) or CSS (P=0.068). In contrast to this, treatment interruption was independent prognosticator of all three endpoints used (P=0.00031, P=0.0075 and P=0.00033, respectively). When 11 patients with treatment interruptions were excluded, the reason for not undergoing surgery still affected OS (P=0.037) and CSS (P=0.039) but not LRFS (P=0.11).

3285,"A new recombined double low restorer line for the Ogu-INRA cms in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) A major objective of breeders using the Ogu-INRA cytoplasmic male sterility (cms) system in rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is to obtain double low restorer lines with a shorter introgression and a good agronomic value. The development of low glucosinolate content (low GC) restorer lines often occurs through the deletion of a part of the introgression. One of these lines has lost the radish Pgi-2 allele expression, without recovering that of the rapeseed Pgi-2 allele. This line shows a defect in the meiotic transmission of the restorer gene Rfo and a very poor agronomic value. We initiated a programme to force non-spontaneous recombination between this Rfo-carrying introgression and the rapeseed homologous chromosome from a low GC B. napus line. Gamma ray irradiation was used to induce chromosome breakage just prior meiosis aiming at just such a recombination. Low GC cms plants were crossed with the pollen of irradiated plants that were heterozygous for this introgression. The F 2 families were scored for their vigour, transmission rate of Rfo and female fertility. One family of plants, R2000, showed an improved behaviour for these three traits. This family presented a unique combination of molecular markers when compared to other rapeseed restorers analysed, which suggests that the recombination event allowed the recovery of B. oleracea genetic information that was originally replaced by the radish introgression in the original restorers. This resulted in a duplicated region (originating from radish and B. oleracea) on the chromosome carrying the introgression in the R2000 family. © Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded
3162,"Metastatic spinal cord compression. Influence of time between onset of motoric deficits and start of irradiation on therapeutic effect Background: In a retrospective analysis we investigated the prognostic significance of the interval between first appearance of motoric deficits and the beginning of radiation therapy (RT) with regard to posttreatment motoric function. Material(s) and Method(s): Data of more than 400 consecutive patients being irradiated at our department between 1994 and 1997 because of vertebral metastases were reviewed. Ninety-six patients fulfilled selection criteria including motoric deficits, no preceding surgical or radiotherapeutic treatment of the spine, minimum total dose of 24 Gy referred to spinal cord, and additional treatment with dexamethasone. Two subgroups with a similar number of patients for better comparability were formed according to the time of developing motoric deficits: 1 to 13 days (49 patients) and >=14 days (47 patients). Effect of irradiation on motoric function was evaluated 2 weeks and about 3 months after radiotherapy. Patients with severe deterioration of motoric function within 48 hours before radiation therapy (31 patients) were looked at separately. Result(s): Two weeks after radiotherapy 42/47 patients (89%) developing motoric deficits >= 14 days showed improvement of motoric function in comparison to 6/49 patients (12%) of the other group. Deterioration occurred in 1/47 patients (2%) of the first and in 24/49 patients (49%) of the latter group. In case of severe deterioration of motoric function within 48 hours before radiation therapy only 2/31 patients (6%) showed improvement, but 20/31 (65%) deterioration. About 3 months after radiotherapy comparable results were observed. Median survival time was 4 months. Conclusion(s): A slower development of motoric deficits before beginning of radiotherapy means a better therapeutic effect and a more favorable functional outcome after treatment. The prognosis is extraordinarily poor if severe deterioration of motoric function occurs within 48 hours before radiotherapy.",Excluded
2322,"Comparison of a reduced radiation fluoroscopy protocol to conventional fluoroscopy during uncomplicated ureteroscopy Objectives: Although the long-term effects of radiation exposure are not completely predictable, the principle of keeping radiation exposure ""as low as reasonably achievable"" should be used. The purpose of this study was to compare fluoroscopy times before and after the implementation of a protocol designed to reduce fluoroscopy usage during ureteroscopy. Method(s): A retrospective review was conducted of 300 consecutive ureteroscopy patients at a single institution. Patients undergoing simple ureteroscopy without ancillary procedures or balloon dilation were further evaluated to determine the effect of a reduced fluoroscopy protocol. The protocol included several measures, including use of a laser-guided C-arm, use of a designated fluoroscopy technician and substitution of visual for fluoroscopic cues during ureteroscopy. Fluoroscopy times were compared between groups using a paired t test with P <.05 considered significant. Result(s): Ureteroscopy cases before protocol implementation (n = 30) were compared with procedures after implementation (n = 30). Stone size and location were similar between groups. Protocol implementation significantly reduced the mean fluoroscopy exposure from 86.1 seconds (range 30-300) to 15.5 seconds (range 0-54; P <.001). There was no difference in mean operative time (74.2 vs 65.1 minutes; P =.14), or complications (2 patients vs 2 patients; P = 1) between groups. No complication in either group could be ascribed to the fluoroscopic technique. Conclusion(s): The reduced fluoroscopy protocol resulted in an 82% reduction in fluoroscopy time without altering patient outcomes. These simple radiation-reducing techniques add no technical difficulty and improve safety for the patient, surgeon, and operating room staff by lowering radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
465,"Lack of correlation between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included

Patients were randomized to 80-kVp imaging (n = 103) or 100-kVp imaging (n = 105). Three blinded readers graded interpretability and image quality. Study signal, noise, and contrast were also compared., RESULTS: Imaging with 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with 47% lower median radiation dose (median dose-length product, 62.0 mGy . cm [interquartile range, 54.0-123.3 mGy . cm] vs 117.0 mGy . cm [110.0-225.9 mGy . cm], respectively; 0.9 mSv [0.8-1.7 mSv] vs 1.6 mSv [1.4-3.2 mSv]; p < 0.001 for each) with no significant difference in interpretability (99% vs 99%; p = 0.99) or image quality (median score, 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.6-4.0] vs 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.8-4.0]; p = 0.20). Studies obtained using 80 kVp were associated with 27% increased signal (mean +/- SD, 756 +/- 157 vs 594 +/- 105 HU; p < 0.001), 25% higher contrast (890 +/- 156 vs 709 +/- 108 HU; p < 0.001), and 50% greater noise (55 +/- 15 vs 37 +/- 12 HU; p < 0.001) with resultant 15% and 16% decreases in signal-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 5 vs 17 +/- 5; p < 0.001) and contrast-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 17 +/- 6 vs 21 +/- 5; p < 0.001) ratios, respectively., CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA using 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in radiation dose with no significant difference in interpretability and noninferior image quality despite lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The use of 80-kVp tube voltage should be considered in dose-reduction strategies for coronary CTA of individuals with a normal BMI.",Excluded
1462,"Correlation between radiation dose and p53 protein expression levels in human lymphocytes The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between p53 protein levels and absorbed doses from in vitro irradiated human lymphocytes. For this, samples of blood from 23 donors were irradiated with 0.5; 1; 2; and 4 Gy from a Cobalt-60 source, and the percentages of lymphocytes expressing p53 were scored using Flow Cytometry. The subjects were divided into 3 groups, in accordance with the p53 levels expressed per radiation dose: low (Group I), high (Group II), and excessive levels (Group III). For all groups, the analyses showed that the p53 expression levels increase with the absorbed dose. Particularly for groups I and II, the correlation between this protein expression and the dose follows the linear-quadratic model, such as for radioinduced chromosomal aberrations. In conclusion, our findings indicate possible applications of this approach in evaluating individual radiosensitivity prior to radiotherapeutical procedures as well as in medical surveillance of occupationally exposed workers. Furthermore, due to the rapidity of flow-cytometric analyses, the methodology here employed would play an important role in emergency responses to a large-scale radiation incident where many people may have been exposed.",Included
21,"Effects of laser irradiation on arthritic histopathology and heat shock protein 70 expression in C57 black mice with osteoarthritis OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of three different laser treatments (650 nm alone, 10.6 mum alone and combined laser of 650 nm and 10.6 mum) on experimental osteoarthritis of the knees in C57 black mice., METHODS: Sixty C57 black mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded
1491,"Reirradiation of recurrent high-grade glioma and development of prognostic scores for progression and survival Background: Optimal techniques and patient selection for salvage reirradiation of high-grade glioma (HGG) are unclear. In this study, we identify prognostic factors for freedom from progression (FFP) and overall survival (OS) after reirradiation, risk factors for high-grade toxicity, and validate clinical prognostic scores. Method(s): A total of 116 patients evaluated between 2000 and 2018 received reirradiation for HGG (99 WHO grade IV, 17 WHO grade III). Median time to first progression after initial therapy was 10.6 months. Salvage therapies before reirradiation included surgery (31%) and systemic therapy (41%). Sixty-five patients (56%) received single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as reirradiation. The median biologically effective dose (BED) was 47.25 Gy, and the median planning target volume (PTV) was 4.8 cc for SRS and 95.0 cc for non-SRS treatments. Systemic therapy was given concurrently to 52% and adjuvantly to 74% of patients. Result(s): Median FFP was 4.9 months, and median OS was 11.0 months. Significant multivariable prognostic factors for FFP were performance status, time to initial progression, and BED; for OS they were age, time to initial progression, and PTV volume at recurrence. High-grade toxicity was correlated to PTV size at recurrence. Three-level prognostic scores were generated for FFP and OS, with cross-validated receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.640 and 0.687, respectively. Conclusion(s): Clinical variables at the time of reirradiation for HGG can be used to prognosticate FFP and OS.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
1896,"Optimized radioiodine therapy of Graves' disease: Analysis of the delivered dose and of other possible factors affecting outcome The best approach to radioiodine dose selection in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism remains highly controversial. The formula to calculate the individual dose of 131I to be delivered has been used for half a century and takes into account the thyroid mass, the effective half- life and the maximum uptake of 131I. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of this formula by determining the relationship between the administered dose of 131I calculated to deliver a target dose of 50 Gy to the thyroid and the actual exact organ dose. We further analyzed if therapeutic success, defined by euthyroidism following the individually calculated dose, can be predicted by different pretreatment parameters and particularly by organ dose. One hundred patients with a first episode of Graves' disease and who had received optimal thyroid irradiation after precise dosimetry were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were categorized according to their thyroid function (plasma free thyroxine (T4) serum concentration) as eu-, hyper- or hypothyroid during and 1 year after treatment. The relationship between the administered dose and organ dose was assessed by simple regression. We compared free T4, free tri-iodothyronine, thyroid weight, the number of patients with antithyroperoxidase antibodies and TSH receptor autoantibodies. 24 h urinary iodine excretion, 131I uptake, and the exact dose of 131I delivered to the thyroid as pretreatment variables. Although we found a correlation between administered dose (mCi) and organ dose (Gy) (r = 0.3, P = 0.003), the mean coefficient of variation for organ dose was 45%. Individualized radioiodine therapy enabled euthyroidism in 26% of patients and failed in 74% of patients (33% had persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism and 41% permanent hypothyroidism). 131I uptake was significantly higher in the hyperthyroidism group in comparison with the euthyroid group. However, organ dose and other pretreatment variables did not differ among the three groups. In conclusion, these results confirm the low performance of individual dosimetry using what are established ratios, since the delivered dose to the gland, although correlated to the intended dose, is highly variable. The finding that other usual pretreatment variables are not different between groups, gives little hope for improving the way of calculating the ideal dose of radioiodine. We suggest to those not yet ready to give a standard or an ablative dose for Graves' hyperthyroidism that they abandon this way to calculate the 131I dose.",Excluded
1374,"Lumbar disc geometry affects the risk for rod fracture in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Rod fracture (RF) has significant consequences for patients, including pain, loss of correction, and revision surgery. Risk factors associated with RF include previous spine surgery, insufficient sagittal vertical axis (SVA) correction and pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO). Increased lumbar disc geometry, regardless of PSO, SVA or previous surgery, may be a risk factor affecting RF rates. PURPOSE: To evaluate if larger disc geometry affects rod stresses adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra increasing the risk of rod fracture. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Single center retrospective review. PATIENT SAMPLE: Thirty-nine patients with ASD who underwent open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Rod fracture complication; lumbar disc height, diameter, and volume. METHOD(S): All patients with ASD having open posterior fusion constructs crossing the T/L junction and pelvis with scoliosis x-rays and 2-year follow-up were included. Patients were divided into 2 Groups: Group 1-patients with RF; Group 2-No RF. RESULT(S): Thirty-nine of 52 patients met inclusion criteria. Group 1-included 15/39 (38%) patients with RF all requiring revision surgery. Group 2-included 24 (62%) patients without RF. There was no difference in age, construct length, number of nonfused lumbar discs, previous spinal surgery, pre- or postoperative SVA or PSOs between the Groups (Table 1). Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. There were significant differences between the RF vs No RF Groups in L1/2 disc heights (H) (8.5 vs 6.5 mm, p=.03), L2/3 H (9.6 vs 6.7 mm, p=.015); L1/2 diameters (D) (41.4 vs 34 mm, p<.01), L2/3 D (43.2 vs 36.2 mm, p=.01); and L1/2 volumes (V) (11714 vs 7817 mm3, p=.02), L2/3 V (14025 vs 8955 mm3, p=.02), respectively. L3/4 and L4/5 disc geometry was larger in the RF Group but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSION(S): The overall prevalence of RF was 38% with no differences in previous spinal surgery, SVA, or PSOs between the 2 Groups.Vertical stature and male gender were significantly higher in the RF Group. Patients with RF had significantly larger nonfused disc heights, diameters, and volumes adjacent to the PSO or apical lumbar vertebra.

3417,"Definitive chemoradiotherapy of limited-disease small cell lung cancer: Retrospective analysis of new predictive factors affecting treatment results The aim of this study was to evaluate potential predictive factors in the treatment of limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). A total of 33 patients with LD-SCLC who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy at our institute between April 1996 and May 2007 were enrolled in our retrospective study. The relationship between a range of potential predictive factors and the initial response, time to progression and pattern of failure was analyzed. The factors evaluated included the tumor markers Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (Pro-GRP) and neuron-specific enolase; net tumor size (sum of each lesion mass on computed tomography at 1-cm intervals); total radiation dose; biological effective dose (BED); overall treatment time (OTT); time between the start of any type of treatment and the end of radiation therapy (SER). In addition, the novel factors of radiation dose-intensity (RDI = BED/OTT) and RDI/NTS (= RDI/net tumor size) were defined. Of the 33 patients evaluated in our study, 22 (67%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 27 (82%) experienced treatment failure or recurrence. High RDI/NTS values showed a significant correlation with CR (P=0.043). Prolonged OTT and lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with recurrence within 12 months (P=0.022, 0.033 and 0.015, respectively). The lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with distant metastasis as a first failure site (P=0.038 and 0.044, respectively). Patients with RDI/NTS =0.08 had a more favorable prognosis (P=0.045). Thus, RDI and RDI/NTS may become beneficial predictive factors in the treatment of LD-SCLC. However, further studies are required to confirm our preliminary results.",Excluded
1476,"Gamma knife radiosurgery in the treatment of tumor-related facial pain Background: Intracranial neoplasms can cause pain similar to trigeminal neuralgia. Literature regarding radiosurgery for this is limited. We present a retrospective review of patients with tumor-related facial pain from benign lesions treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) at Wake Forest University. Objective(s): The primary objectives were to determine long-term pain relief and predictive factors for pain alleviation. Method(s): We reviewed 515 patients treated with GKRS for benign meningioma, vestibular schwannoma or trigeminal schwannoma between August 1999 and August 2010. Twenty-one eligible patients had tumor-related facial pain prior to GKRS. The median marginal tumor dose was 12 Gy. Long-term pain relief data were obtained by chart review and telephone interview. Result(s): The median follow-up for symptom evaluation was 3.8 years. Seventeen of 21 patients (81%) experienced a Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI) score of I-III at 6 months following GKRS. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from BNI IV-V relapse were 66% at 1 year and 53% at 2 years. No pain relapses occurred after 2 years. Conclusion(s): GKRS of benign lesions is a noninvasive option for patients with tumor-related facial pain. Pain relief is modest, with the majority of pain relapses occurring within 2 years and approximately one half of patients maintaining relief beyond 2 years. Copyright © 2012 S.

The number of melanocytes and the activity of melanogenesis return to normal after cessation of irradiation., OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of reduction of melanocytes by apoptosis to prevent an uncontrolled increase in melanocytes within the epidermis., METHODS: The position of the melanocytes before and after UVA 1 irradiation was controlled by electronmicroscopy and histochemistry using Fontana-Masson staining. The status of apoptosis was demonstrated immunohistologically by the use of p53 and bcl2., RESULTS: A dose-dependent shift of melanocytes into the corium could be demonstrated. At low irradiation doses (20 J/cm2) pendulous melanocytes protrude into the dermis without losing contact to the dermoepidermal basement membrane. Higher irradiation doses (60 J/cm2) lead to a total elimination of fibrillary degenerated, apoptotic or even morphologically intact melanocytes into the corium. Once transported into the corium, the melanocytes can be detected there for more than 4 years., CONCLUSION: This shift mechanism seems to regulate and control UV-induced proliferation of epidermal melanocytes.",Excluded
750,"Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing AIM: Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients., MATERIALS-METHODS: This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization., RESULTS: Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism., CONCLUSION: We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

1296,"Infrapopliteal Angioplasty of One or More than One Artery for Critical Limb Ischaemia: A Randomised Clinical Trial Objective: The aim was to analyse the effect of the treatment of more than one infrapopliteal artery with respect to wound healing and limb salvage. Method(s): Seventy-eight patients were enrolled prospectively for 80 procedures (80 limbs) that were randomly divided into two groups: 40 in the single vessel (SV) group and 40 in the multiple vessel group (MV). All patients had tissue loss. The choice of the first artery to treat was based on an analysis of two factors: the ease of the required endovascular technique and the presence of adequate distal outflow. The randomisation point was after the first successful distal artery angioplasty. The primary endpoints were the wound healing rate and limb salvage. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 69.1 +/- 4.3 years, and 56% were male. Concomitant treatment of the femoral and popliteal arteries was performed in 38.8% of patients. All demographic characteristics and technical aspects were statistically comparable for both groups. Successful recanalisation was achieved in 95.8%, 86.2%, 86.9%, and 92.5% for the tibio-fibular trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and fibular artery, respectively. In the MV group, a higher contrast volume (29 mL more; p =.049), longer procedure time (p =.01), and higher radiation exposure (p =.04) were noted. There was no difference in renal function between the groups either before or 30 days after the procedure (p =.165). The limb salvage rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 75.9% and 67% for the SV group and 91.1% and 91.1% for the MV group (log rank p =.052). The wound healing rates after 1 and 3 years, respectively, were 33.6% and 70.9% for the SV and 63.9% and 78.4% for MV group (log rank p =.006). Wound healing was faster in MV (2.11 cm2/month) than SV group (0.62 cm2/month; p =.004). Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of more than one artery was associated with better wound healing rates but not with better limb salvage.Copyright © 2017 European Society for Vascular Surgery",Excluded
3396,"The second oncogenic step Three theories of the development of a malignant change which each involve two successive steps are described. Armitage, Doll (1957) proposed that two homologous chromosomes each contained a region which was critical in the control of cell division. The two steps were mutations in these regions brought about by random exposure to carcinogenic agents. Comings (1973) proposed a similar theory but the two steps were considered to be spontaneous mutatons. This paper points out that if one mutation has occurred this can become dominant in at least six ways which mostly involve chromosome translocations. The synergism between oncogenic agents and ionizing radiation and the ability to breed out high and low cancer incidence stocks of animals from a common stock can be explained on the same lines.",Excluded
1452,"A phase II trial of accelerated multimodality therapy for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction: The impact of clinical heterogeneity OBJECTIVES: This is a report of mature results from a phase II trial of an accelerated multimodality treatment program for locoregionally advanced cancer of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction with a focus on the impact of clinical heterogeneity on outcomes. A split course of pre- and postoperative hyperfractionated radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy was used in an effort to limit perioperative mortality. METHOD(S): Eligibility required a diagnosis of esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and an esophageal ultrasound stage of at least T3, N1, or M1A. Patients received a 12-day induction course of radiation (1.5 Gy twice a dose to a dose of 30 Gy) concurrent with 4-day continuous intravenous infusions of cisplatin (20 mg/m per day) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m per day) beginning on day 1. Surgery followed in 4 to 6 weeks followed 6 to 10 weeks later by a second, identical course of chemoradiotherapy. RESULT(S): From October 1999 through March 2003, 93 patients were enrolled; 96% were white, 86% male, and 83% had adenocarcinoma. Resection was possible in 83 patients (89%) with 4 (5%) perioperative deaths. With a median follow up of 50 months (range, 34-72 months), the 3-year projected overall survival rate is 27.9%, freedom from recurrence 30.5%, and distant metastatic control 32.4%. Locoregional control in resected patients is 86%. Freedom from recurrence and distant control were significantly better in patients with 1) earlier pretreatment clinical stage, 2) earlier postinduction pathologic stage, 3) squamous cell cancer, and 4) a pathologic response. CONCLUSION(S): This accelerated multimodality treatment program is feasible and perioperative mortality proved acceptable. Despite excellent locoregional control, freedom from recurrence, and overall survival proved disappointing reflecting the frequency of distant metastases.

1794,"The treatment of movement disorders using gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery GK radiosurgical thalamotomy is an effective and useful alternative to invasive radiofrequency techniques for patients at high surgical risk. The mechanical accuracy of the gamma unit combined with the anatomical accuracy of high-resolution MR imaging makes radiosurgical lesioning safe and precise. Higher radiosurgical doses are more effective than lower ones at eliminating or reducing tremor and are without complications. The results from radiosurgical pallidotomy have been disappointing compared to those of gamma thalamotomy. A 50% complication rate in the former (homonymous field cuts, hemipareses, and dysphagias) combined with a poor success rate has led us to re-evaluate the indications for this procedure in the face of the excellent results obtained from radiofrequency pallidotomy with physiological monitoring. Perhaps lowered radiosurgical prescription doses can improve the complication rate. Anatomically, there appears to be a different sensitivity of the pallidum to radiation than that of the thalamus. Age-related or anatomy-related susceptible blood supply to the area may lead to hypoxia after single-fraction radiosurgery in a nuclear complex known to be especially susceptible to hypoxia. In addition, varying levels of iron deposition within the pallidum may catalyze free radical formation in the elderly only to be further exacerbated by tissue hypoxia. Future experience with radiosurgical treatment of essential tremor, dystonias, and other movement disorders should parallel that of radiofrequency techniques.",Excluded
223,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
2496,"Phase I/II study of induction chemotherapy using carboplatin plus irinotecan and sequential thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for elderly patients with limited-disease smallcell lung cancer (LD-SCLC): TORG 0604 Background: The role of irinotecan for elderly patients with LD-SCLC has been unclear, and the timing of TRT combined with chemotherapy has not been fully evaluated. Method(s): Patients aged > 70 years with untreated, measurable, LD-SCLC, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8, every 21 days for 4 cycles, and sequential TRT (54Gy in 27 fractions). Carboplatin doses were based on AUC of 4 and 5 (levels 1 and 2, respectively), with a fixed irinotecan dose (50 mg/m2). Primary objective of the phase II study was overall responce rate. Result(s): Forty-three patients were enrolled and forty-one were finally analyzed (median age: 75 years [range 70-86 years); males 31; PS 0/1/2, n = 22/18/1]. Two patients were excluded because of protocol violation (ascertained to be extensive disease). Twelve patients were accrued at phase I and the number of patients with carboplatin dose-limiting toxicities at levels-1 (n = 6) and -2 (n = 6) were 1(grade 3 hypertension) and 2 (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), respectively. The phase II trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose, total of 35 patients. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 (range 1-4), and the median radiation dose was 54Gy (range 36-60). Toxicities were generally mild. There were 4 complete and 27 partial responses (response rate 88.6%). With a median follow-up of 52 months, the median progression-free and overall survival times of phase II were 11.2 and 27.1 months, respectively. Conclusion(s): Induction chemotherapy of carboplatin plus irinotecan and sequential TRT was well tolerated and effective for elderly patients with LD-SCLC.

However, posterior fixation has not yet been decided. We compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 100 patients, who underwent unilateral (group U) or bilateral (group B) instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. Forty-one patients in group U were undergoing unilateral pedicle screw instrumentation, and 59 patients in group B were undergoing bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation. Clinical characteristic and demographic data before surgery were compared. The intraoperative data, including operative time with changes in positions, intraoperative blood loss, and X-ray exposure time, as well as the perioperative data, including postoperative hospital stay and clinical and radiographic data were compared. As a result, Group U required a significantly shorter operating time than group B. The subsidence grade and fusion rates exhibited no significant differences in the postoperative radiographic evaluation. Group U had better results in clinical assessments than group B.

We investigated the relationship between OA and serum adiponectin levels according to the radiographic features of knee and hand OA. A total of 2402 subjects was recruited from the Dong-gu Study. Baseline characteristics were collected via a questionnaire, and X-rays of knee and hand joints were scored using a semi-quantitative grading system. The relationship between serum adiponectin levels and radiographic severity was evaluated by linear and logistic regression analysis. Subjects in the higher serum adiponectin levels tertiles were older and had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those in the lower tertiles. Regarding knee joint scores, serum adiponectin levels was positively associated with the total (P<0.001), osteophyte (P=0.003), and joint space narrowing (JSN) scores (P<0.001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, education, and physical activity. In terms of hand joint scores, no association was found between serum adiponectin levels and the total, osteophyte, JSN, subchondral cyst, sclerosis, erosion, or malalignment score after the above-mentioned adjustments. Similarly, subjects with serum adiponectin levels above the median had higher total radiographic scores in the knee joints, but not in the hand joints, after adjustment. An increased serum adiponectin levels was associated with a higher radiographic score in the knee joint, but not in the hand joint, suggesting the involvement of different pathophysiologic mechanisms in the development of OA between those joints.",Excluded
1008,"Irradiated homologous rib grafts in nasal reconstruction OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term efficacy of irradiated homologous rib grafts (IHRGs) for both augmentation and support function in rhinoplasty in general and for specific recipient sites within the nose.

RESULT(S): We studied 66 patients, with a total of 177 IHRGs, dating back 9 years, with an average follow-up of 51 months. The rate of resorption increased with duration of follow-up. Complete resorption was found in 1 IHRG, and moderate resorption was observed in 55 IHRGs (31%). Resorption was characterized by a loss of support function rather than a loss of volume. Moderate resorption had a negative clinical outcome for shield grafts only. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated homologous rib grafts were safe to use in rhinoplasty.

2412,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded

To assess cancer control knowledge and priorities among primary care physicians in Missouri, we conducted a random survey of 207 physicians. Although reported knowledge of the role tobacco plays in cancer causation was high, activity in tobacco cessation counselling and referral was low. Respondents considered diet to be a relatively unimportant factor in cancer causation, whereas they viewed sun exposure, genetics/family history, and radiation exposure as large contributors to the cancer burden. Among cancer early detection tests, high activity was shown for the Pap test and breast examination. Conversely, low activity was reported for colon sigmoidoscopy. Inverse correlations were shown between age group of the physician and several cancer prevention and early detection practices. For each cancer prevention and screening practice, reported activity was higher for medical doctors than for doctors of osteopathic medicine. Possible barriers or controversies in cancer control included disagreement with the current recommendation for Pap testing, the cost of mammography, and patient fear of sigmoidoscopy. These findings suggest that primary care physicians are not achieving their full potential in cancer control and indicate areas where increased emphasis is warranted.",Excluded

This study examined the incidence rates of cancer cases (averages for 2006-2010) and relationships with environmental radioactivity levels. Soil and water samples were collected from provincial and district centers of Van city and the outdoor gamma doses were determined using a portable gamma scintillation detector. Gross alpha and beta, (226)Ra, (232)Th, and (40)K activities were measured in both tap water and soil samples. Although high rates of stomach and esophagus cancers have been reported previously in Van the underlying reasons have not hitherto been defined. Incidences of cancers were highest in the Gurpinar (326.0) and Ozalp (377.1) counties (p<0.001). As to the results of the gross alpha and gross beta radioactivity measurements in the drinking water, these two counties also had high beta radionuclide levels: Gurpinar (140 mBq/dm3) and Ozalp (206 mBq/dm3). Even if within the normal range, a relation between the higher rate of the incidence of stomach and esophagus cancers with that of the higher rate of beta radionuclide activity was clear. On Spearman correlation analysis, the relation between higher beta radionuclide levels and cancer incidence was found to be statistically significant (p<0.01). According to the results of the analysis, Van residents receive an average 1.86 mSv/y annual dose from outdoor gamma radiation, ingestion of radionuclides in the drinking water, and indoor 222Rn activity. Moreover, gross alpha and beta activities were found to be extremely high in all of the lakes around the city of Van, Turkey.

One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability.

By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Participants (n = 116) with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grade U (unclassified) or grade I-IV COPD provided informed consent to an ethics board-approved HIPAA-compliant protocol and underwent spirometry and plethysmography, completed the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), completed a 6-minute walk test for the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and underwent hyperpolarized helium 3 (3He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT). Emphysema was estimated by using the MR imaging apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and the relative area of the CT attenuation histogram with attenuation of 2950 HU or less (RA950). Airway disease was measured by using the CT airway wall thickness of airways with an internal perimeter of 10 mm and total airway count. Ventilation defect percentage at 3He MR imaging was used to measure ventilation. Multivariable regression models for the 6MWD and SGRQ symptom subscore were used to evaluate the relationships between physiologic and imaging measurements. Result(s): Multivariate modeling for the 6MWD in 80 patients with GOLD grade U-II COPD showed that ADC (b = 0.34, P = .04), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (b = 0.60, P = .0008), and residual volume/total lung capacity (b = 20.26, P = .02) were significant variables, while forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and airway disease measurements were not. In 36 patients with GOLD grade III or IV disease, FEV1 (b = 0.48, P = .01) was the only significant contributor in a multivariate model for 6MWD. MR imaging emphysema measurements also made the greatest relative contribution to symptoms in patients with milder (GOLD grade U-II) COPD (ADC: b = 0.60, P = .005; RA950: b = 20.52, P = .02; FEV1: b = 20.45, P = .0002) and in grade III or IV disease (ADC: b = 0.95, P = .01; RA950: b = 20.62, P = .07; airway count: b = 20.49, P = .01).

2640,"Genetic variants in inflammation-related genes are associated with radiation-induced toxicity following treatment for non-small cell lung cancer Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is often accompanied by the development of esophagitis and pneumonitis. Identifying patients who might be at increased risk for normal tissue toxicity would help in determination of the optimal radiation dose to avoid these events. We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10-3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09-2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09-10.49). Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31-0.96). Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14-7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03-10.18, respectively). The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P,0.001).

3303,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included

Nevertheless, ultrasound images seem to be low contrast images as well as the physician could encounter the possible challenges in the identification of the lesions. Therefore, there has been an inevitable requirement in the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for the purpose of classifying breast lesion in an accurate manner. This paper aims at the analyzing the Morphological and Fractal features in an effective manner for differentiating benign as well as malignant masses from ultrasound images.

2505,"Transcriptional corepressor MTG16 regulates small intestinal crypt proliferation and crypt regeneration after radiation-induced injury Myeloidtranslocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressorsimplicated in development, malignancy, differentiation, and stem cellfunction. While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included
1926,"Modified percutaneous vertebroplasty assisted by preoperative CT-based digital design: a new technique for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture OBJECTIVE: To report a new technique of modified percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) assisted by preoperative CT-based digital design for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF), and to discuss its preliminary clinical results., METHODS: Thoracolumbar spine segment data (Dicom format) were obtained from lamellar CT scanning of seven old female or male with single OVCF. A three-dimensional model of thoracolumbar spine and simulative PVP models (via double transpedicular approach) were built in the Mimics software. With the help of a preoperative transparent marker located at the back midline skin and preoperative digital design by Mimics software, the needle insert point and needle direction in every patient were established. The surgical time, the number of intraoperative radiation perspective, bone cement filling condition in fracture vertebra, intraoperative complications and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores before and after surgery were recorded to evaluate the preliminary clinical results after modified PVP., RESULTS: The puncture process during PVP was in high accordance with the preoperative digital design by Mimics software in seven cases of single OVCF with the average age of 78 years old. The operation time was only 16.57+/-2.07 minutes and the intraoperative radiation perspective numbers were less than ten (7.86+/-1.68) times. The bone cement filling in all fracture vertebras were good and no surgical complications such as spine cord injury and cement leakage were founded. The VAS scores before and after surgery were 8.57+/-0.53 points and 1.43+/-0.53 point (P=0.000), respectively., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) assisted by preoperative CT-based digital design has high accuracy, which is expected to reduce operation time, intraoperative radiation exposure and the surgical complications related to puncture failure.",Excluded
1542,"Evaluation of acoustic radiation force impulse imaging for the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant liver tumors BACKGROUND & AIMS: Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging is a novel radiation force-based imaging modality for the evaluation of the tissue stiffness. It can provide measurement of tissue stiffness with shear wave velocity that depends on the tissue stiffness. It has been utilized for the evaluation of liver fibrosis of chronic liver diseases. However, it is still uncertain whether ARFI imaging can be applied for the differentiation of liver tumors. The aim of this study is to examine whether ARFI elastography can differentiate benign and malignant liver tumors. METHOD(S): Forty-four patients of liver tumors were enrolled. Eighteen cases (14 men, 4 women; mean age 61.4 years) were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 20 cases (6 men, 14 women; mean age 57.0 years) were cavernous hemangioma, and 6 cases (;4men,2women,mean age 62.8years) were metastatic liver tumor. The underlying diagnosis of these liver tumors was established with CE-MDCT, CE-MRI, and/or US-guided tumor biopsy. All patients were underwent ARFI elastography using a Siemens Acuson S2000. The velocity of the shear wave from the liver tumors was calculated as the average value of six trials. RESULT(S): The average velocities of the shear wave of HCC, cavernous hemangioma, and metastatic liver tumor were 2.08 +/-0.62m/s, 1.56+/-0.64m/s, and 2.42+/-1.05m/s, respectively. The average velocities of the shear wave of HCC and metastatic liver tumor were significantly higher than that of cavernous hemangioma (p <0.05, Mann- Whitney test). But no significant difference was observed between those of HCC and metastatic liver tumor. It is noteworthy that although the primary tumors of the 6 cases of metastatic liver tumors were varied (2 pancreas cancers, urinary bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, and lung cancer), the average velocity of the metastatic liver tumors of these cancers was significantly higher than that of cavernous hemangioma. In addition, the average of velocity of the shear wave of the liver bearing HCC (1.68+/-0.42m/s) was significantly higher (p<0.05, Mann-Whitney test) than those of the livers bearing cavernous hemangioma (1.08+/-0.27m/s) and metastatic liver tumor (1.13+/-0.27m/s), consisting with that patients of HCC are accompanied with chronic hepatic diseases. CONCLUSION(S): Our study revealed that ARFI elastography can be a non-invasive and beneficial method for the differential diagnosis between the benign and malignant liver tumors.",Excluded
2649,"The association of primary tumor site with acute adverse event and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy for cStage II/III esophageal cancer: an exploratory analysis of JCOG0909 Background: JCOG0909 is a phase II trial of definitive chemoradiotherapy including salvage treatment for cStage II-III thoracic esophageal cancer; the radiation field for elective regional lymph node irradiation, which can affect patient outcome and adverse event, varied based on the primary tumor site, i.e., upper (Ut), middle (Mt), and lower thoracic (Lt) esophagus. The impact of different primary sites on the safety and efficacy of definitive chemoradiotherapy in JCOG0909 is not well characterized. Method(s): Patients were categorized into three groups (Ut, Mt, and Lt) according to the primary tumor location. We compared acute adverse events during definitive chemoradiotherapy, complete response (CR) rate, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) among the 3 groups. Result(s): Out of the 96 patients enrolled in JCOG0909 between April 2010 and August 2014, 94 patients (16, 59, and 19 patients in the Ut, Mt, and Lt groups, respectively) were included in this exploratory analysis. The proportion of patients with cStage III was 25% in the Ut, 37% in the Mt, and 47% in the Lt group. Grade 3-4 leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were more frequently observed in the Mt (66%, 54%, and 15%) and Lt groups (84%, 68%, and 16%) than in the Ut group (38%, 44%, and 0%). There was no significant between-group difference with respect to 3-year OS (73.3%, 77.9%, and 57.9%), 3-year PFS (60.0%, 59.3%, and 47.4%), or CR rate (62.5%, 62.7%, and 42.1%). Conclusion(s): In JCOG0909, the incidence of severe hematological toxicity had a trend toward higher in the Mt and Lt than the Ut esophageal cancer; however, no remarkable difference by primary sites was observed with respect to efficacy endpoints.Copyright © 2020, The Japan Esophageal Society.",Excluded
15,"Radioembolization of symptomatic, unresectable neuroendocrine hepatic metastases using yttrium-90 microspheres PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, efficacy, and symptom-control of radioembolization in patients with unresectable liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETLMs)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age of 62 years) with treatment-refractory NETLMs underwent radioembolization using yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres. Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded
1455,"Radiation therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the subglottic larynx Objective: This study aims to summarize our institution's experience in treating patients with primary subglottic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with radiotherapy (RT) and to define the optimal treatment plan for these patients. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 18 patients with subglottic SCC curatively treated with RT between 1977 and 2009. T1 and T2 cancers were considered early disease; T3 and T4 lesions were considered advanced disease. Patients were stratified according to whether they received RT alone or RT and surgery. Patients treated surgically tended to have more advanced disease and required a total laryngectomy. Patients were excluded if they had distant metastasis at diagnosis or if their tumor was glottic in origin and extended inferiorly into the subglottis. Result(s): Twelve patients (67 %) had advanced disease, and six patients (33 %) had early disease. Local control was achieved in 100 % of the patients with early disease, regardless of treatment group. Of the patients with advanced disease, local control was achieved in five of the seven patients (71 %) treated with RT alone and in four of the five (80 %) treated with surgery and RT. Ultimate local control was achieved in six of the seven patients (86 %) with advanced disease treated with RT alone. Overall local control was 83 % at 5 years, with a 5-year cause-specific survival of 66 % and a 5-year overall survival of 44 %. Local-regional control mirrored that of local control, with an overall local-regional control rate of 83 %. No patient suffered a severe acute or late complication or acute toxicity during the treatment process. Conclusion(s): Patients with SCC of the subglottic larynx have a high likelihood of local-regional control after undergoing RT along or combined with surgery. Those with T1-T2 and low volume T3-T4 cancers have high probability of local control with voice preservation after definitive RT. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

564,"Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry for Measurement of Phalangeal Bone Mineral Density on a Slot-Scanning Digital Radiography System Objective: In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using two detectors in a slot-scanning digital radiography system to acquire images for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of the middle phalanx of the middle finger using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Method(s): Simulations were used to evaluate the spectral separation of the low- and high-energy spectra and detective quantum efficiency was used for assessing image quality. Scan parameters were chosen to optimize spectral separation, image quality, and radiation dose. We introduce the measurement of volumetric BMD (vBMD) using basis material decomposition. We assess the accuracy of our methods by comparing measurements taken using bone images against reference data derived from subsequent incineration of the bones. In vivo scans were conducted to evaluate the system precision (repeatability) and agreement with a clinical densitometer. Result(s): Average errors for bone mineral content (BMC), areal BMD (aBMD), and vBMD were 4.85%, 5.49%, and 12.77%, respectively. Our system had good agreement with a clinical densitometer based on concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.92 and 0.98 for aBMD and BMC, respectively. Precision studies yielded coefficient of variation (CV) values of 1.35% for aBMD, 1.48% for BMC, and 1.80% for vBMD. The CV values of all measurements were within 2%, indicating that the methods have clinically acceptable precision. Conclusion(s): We conclude that our techniques yield bone measurements with high accuracy, clinically acceptable precision, and good agreement with a clinical densitometer.

3147,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included
3198,"Response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST/RECIST) and SUVmax in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and of pre- and post-treatment maximum Standard Uptake Value (SUVmax) in regards to survival and tumor control for patients treated for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (ES-NSCLC) with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Method(s): This is a retrospective review of patients with ES-NSCLC treated at our institution using SBRT. Lobar, locoregional, and distant failures were evaluated based on PERCIST/RECIST and clinical course. Univariate analysis of the Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), lobar control (LC), locoregional control (LRC), and distant control (DC) was conducted using the log-rank test. Pre- and post-treatment SUVmax were evaluated using cutoffs of <5 and >=5, <4 and >=4, and <3 and >=3. incrementSUVmax was also evaluated at various cutoffs. Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate survival outcomes based on age, gender, pre-treatment gross tumor volume (GTV), longest tumor dimension on imaging, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Result(s): This study included 95 patients (53 female, 42 male), median age 75. Lung SBRT was delivered in 3-5 fractions to a total of 48-60Gy, with a BEDalpha/beta=10Gy of at least 100Gy. Median OS and PFS from the end of SBRT was 15.4 and 11.9months, respectively. On univariate analysis, PERCIST/RECIST response correlated with PFS (p=0.039), LC (p=0.007), and LRC (p=0.015) but not OS (p=0.21) or DC (p=0.94). Pre-treatment SUVmax and post-treatment SUVmax with cutoff values of <5 and >=5, <4 and >=4, and <3 and >=3 did not predict for OS, PFS, LC, LRC, or DC. incrementSUVmax did not predict for OS, PFS, LC, LRC, or DC. On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment GTV >=30cm3 was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes when accounting for other confounding variables. Conclusion(s): PERCIST/RECIST response is associated with improved LC and PFS in patients treated for ES-NSCLC with SBRT. In contrast, pre- and post-treatment SUVmax is not predictive of disease control or survival.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

METHOD(S): Four hundred and fifty subjects at different risk levels for thrombosis, flying in economy class twice in less than a week for more than 8 hours, were included; 295 completed the registry study and were subdivided in 3 groups according to their risk level - low, moderate, or high. The high-risk group also received Aspirin. Astandard management (SM) was used in all groups. In each risk category, three groups were made according to patient management: A Pycnogenol group, a SM group (control), and a stockings group. The groups were comparable at inclusion. No side effects were observed. RESULT(S): In the low risk group edema were reduced more (P<0.05) with Pycnogenol and stockings compared to control. Ankle circumference was smaller with Pycnogenol (P<0.05). No thrombosis was detected. D-dimer was negative in Pycnogenol subjects; one subject in the control group had increased values, as did two of the 36 subjects in the stockings group. In the group with moderate risk, edema and ankle circumference were lower in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). One deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and one minimal superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) was seen in controls. D-dimer was normal in the Pycnogenol group. In high-risk subjects, edema, and ankle circumference were significantly reduced in the Pycnogenol group (P<0.05). There were no SVT or DVT in the Pycnogenol group. One minimal DVT and one SVT were observed in controls. D-dimer was negative in all Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05); three post-flight values increased in controls and in four of the 32 subjects in the stockings group. The jet lag score was lower in low-, medium-, and high-risk Pycnogenol subjects (P<0.05).

1395,"[Radiological determination of femoral rotation deformity--computerized tomography, optimized measurement accuracy and exposure dosage] 58 Patients, suspicious to have rotation deformity of the femur, were examined. To compare the value of diagnostic methods in measuring the degree of malrotation we estimated this degree using clinical examination and calculated the anteversion of the femoral neck, taking radiographs in the technique of Dunn and Rippstein, and a modified method of computed tomography. Only in twelve cases the direction of malrotation was corresponding in all three methods, although considerable variations in quantitative results were noted. Maintaining the exact position of the patient, necessary to get reproducible results using conventional X-ray technique, was impossible in most cases of patients with posttraumatic joint-stiffness and malalignment. Determination of femoral neck anteversion using this modified method of CT is a quick, reproducible technique to calculate the degree of malrotation, insensitive to the position of the patient. By means of this CT method it was possible to approach the highest accuracy in precise preoperative planing. Furthermore the radiation exposure could be reduced in a range of 20%-40%.",Excluded
1842,"A regenerative role for bone marrow following experimental colitis: Contribution to neovasculogenesis and myofibroblasts Background & Aims: Bone marrow (BM) cells form differentiated adult lineages within nonhematopoietic tissues, with a heightened propensity with increasing regenerative pressure dictated by disease. We have previously shown that BM cells engraft into the gut and contribute substantially to the subepithelial intestinal myofibroblast population in the lamina propria. To investigate the reparative capacity of BM in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a well-established model of experimental colitis was used. Method(s): Lethally irradiated female mice were rescued by a BM transplant from male donors. Colitis was induced 6 weeks posttransplantation by injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and tissues were analyzed 1-14 days later. Donor-derived cells were detected by in situ hybridization using a Y chromosome-specific probe, and their phenotype was determined by immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TNBS-induced colitis was manifest as patchy lesions that increased in severity between days 1 and 8, and the mucosa gradually regenerated between days 8 and 14. The contribution of BM to intestinal myofibroblasts was significantly increased in regions of colitis compared with noninflamed regions. Furthermore, BM-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells were frequently interspersed throughout blood vessels, suggesting that these cells facilitate angiogenesis in tissue repair, substantiated by a significant increase in the incidence of BM-derived vascular smooth muscle cells in colitic compared with noninflamed regions. Blood vessels formed entirely from BM-derived cells were also seen, suggesting a role for BM in neovasculogenesis. Conclusion(s): Our data show that BM contributes to multiple intestinal cell lineages in colitis, with an important function in tissue regeneration and vasculogenesis after injury. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.",Excluded

Frequently, patients with osteoarthritis (OA) are misdiagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in primary care centers, leading to wrong treatment and consequent clinical and pharmacoeconomic impact Objectives The objective of this study was to describe demographic and clinical characteristics of a cohort of patients derived to a specialized RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis and finally diagnosed as osteoarthritis Methods A descriptive, cross sectional study. Patients were referred and assisted to a specialized RA center in a 24 month period with presumptive diagnosis of this disease. A complete medical record was fulfilled by a rheumatologist; it was measured rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated antibodies, and other laboratories depending on each case. Also were made x-rays of hands, and in some cases of persistent doubt about the diagnosis was requested comparative MRI of hands. Frequencies and Percentages were calculated for the demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort of patients Results From a total of 3665 Patients derived to specialized in RA center with presumptive RA diagnosis, after medical and laboratory evaluation 1451 (39.6%) had a wrong RA diagnosis; of them 1116 patients (76.9%) had finally osteoarthritis diagnosis. Of these patients 790 (70.7%) were women and 326 (29.2%) men, with an average age of 59.7 (+/-12 years). Majority of these patients were followed by general physicians or internists and treated with non-biologic and biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in the past, for an average time of 4.5 years Conclusions In this cohort of patients the most frequent diagnosis of patients misdiagnosed with RA was osteoarthritis, being more than two thirds of them, predominantly women. This shows the need for the implementation of specialized clinics in RA and educational strategies for primary care physicians in order to avoid the impact of this wrong diagnosis.",Excluded

Relevant diagnostic procedures of the pelvic floor will be presented. Material and methods. A host of diagnoses and symptoms such as the descending perineum syndrome, rectocele, cystocele, enterocele, uterine and vaginal descensus, anal and rectal prolaps, outlet obstruction, anismus, inertia recti and intussusception are included under the heading 'pelvic floor disorders'. Although symptoms are often varied, problems concerning urinary and/or faecal continence commonly lead to primary consultation of a physician. Results. Quite often, apparently divergent symptoms such as constipation and incontinence are simultaneously mentioned. A clear gender disposition is observed with female patients inflicted nine-fold in comparison to male patients. The primary consultant may belong to a variety of specialities such as urology, proctology, gynaecology or dermatology, depending upon the predominant symptom. A feeling of trust is essential for the treatment of a disorder involving highly intimate regions of the body. Discussion. An exact medical history and standardized proctologic evaluation consisting of inspection, palpation, rectoscopy and proctoscopy may be augmented by investigations such as anorectal manometry or endosonography. Conventional defecography has been replaced more and more by dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor in specialized institutions, enabling additional gynaecologic and urologic investigations avoiding ionizing radiation.",Excluded

The clinical and technical characteristics of the first ten proton beam radiotherapy treatments are reported. Ten patients, six males and four females (age range 27-73 years, median 55.5), were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. After one to two surgical procedures, seven patients received a histological diagnosis of chordoma (of the skull base in three cases, the cervical spine in one case and the sacrum in three cases) and three of low-grade chondrosarcoma (skull base). Prescribed doses were 74 GyE for chordoma and 70 GyE for chondrosarcoma at 2 GyE/fraction delivered 5 days per week. Treatment was well tolerated without toxicity-related interruptions. The maximal acute toxicity was grade 2, with oropharyngeal mucositis, nausea and vomiting for the skull base tumours, and grade 2 dermatitis for the sacral tumours. After 6-12 months of follow-up, no patient developed tumour progression. The analysis of the first ten patients treated with proton therapy at CNAO showed that this treatment was feasible and safe. Currently, patient accrual into these as well as other approved protocols is continuing, and a longer follow-up period is needed to assess tumour control and late toxicity.",Excluded
1209,"Estimation of left ventricular ejection fraction with low-dose gated tomographic radionuclide angiography using cadmium-zinc-telluride gamma camera in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy: A dramatic radiation reduction Background: Tomographic radionuclide angiography (TRA) is a simple non-invasive procedure which can monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with automatic processing software, resulting in excellent reproducibility. New gamma cameras using cadmium-zinc-telluride (CZT) detectors enables reduction of the patient radiation dose. We compared LVEF and left ventricular (LV) volumes between low dose and standarddose TRA using a CZT camera. Method(s): Between September and December 2015, patients receiving potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy and undergoing TRA were consecutively included. CZT acquisition was performed in <> after injection of 550MBq 99mTclabelled human serum albumin and lasted 7 minutes (recommended activity: 550-1110MBq, Society of Nuclear Medicine Guidelines). Each acquisition was analyzed full dose and equivalent half dose by the same physician, using the same software (Quantitative Blood Pool SPECT, Cedars Sinai) to generate LVEF and LV volumes. Result(s): 80 patients were analyzed (40% male, mean age 60 years and BMI 28 kg/m2). There was no significant difference in LVEF and LV systolic and diastolic volumes between full dose and equivalent half dose acquisition (p< 0.005). The contrasttonoise ratio wasn't visually decreased. Effective dose were 3.3 millisieverts (mSv) and 1.65mSv respectively for fulldose and equivalent halfdose acquisitions using our parameters. Conclusion(s): LVEF and LV volumes can accurately be determined using fast low-dose CZT acquisition (7 minutes, < 2mSv, below natural radiation) in patients receiving cardio-toxic chemotherapy. This dose reduction up to 50% from the lowest recommended administered activity allows repeated scans in those patients, with reduced dosimetry. Further dose reductions may be achievable.",Excluded
3420,"Cerebrospinal fluid dissemination of high-grade gliomas following boron neutron capture therapy occurs more frequently in the small cell subtype of IDH1R132H mutation-negative glioblastoma We have used boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) to treat patients in Japan with newly diagnosed or recurrent high-grade gliomas and have observed a significant increase in median survival time following BNCT. Although cerebrospinal fluid dissemination (CSFD) is not usually seen with the current standard therapy of patients with glioblastoma (GBM), here we report that subarachnoid or intraventricular CSFD was the most frequent cause of death for a cohort of our patients with high-grade gliomas who had been treated with BNCT. The study population consisted of 87 patients with supratentorial high-grade gliomas; 41 had newly diagnosed tumors and 46 had recurrent tumors. Thirty of 87 patients who were treated between January 2002 and July 2013 developed CSFD. Tumor histology before BNCT and immunohistochemical staining for two molecular markers, Ki-67 and IDH1R132H, were evaluated for 20 of the 30 patients for whom pathology slides were available. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on 3 IDH1R132H-positive and 1 control IDH1R132H-negative tumors in order to determine chromosome 1p and 19q status. Histopathologic evaluation revealed that 10 of the 20 patients' tumors were IDH1R132H-negative small cell GBMs. The remaining patients had tumors consisting of other IDH1R132H-negative GBM variants, an IDH1R132H-positive GBM and two anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Ki-67 immunopositivity ranged from 2 to 75%. In summary, IDH1R132H-negative GBMs, especially small cell GBMs, accounted for a disproportionately large number of patients who had CSF dissemination. This suggests that these tumor types had an increased propensity to disseminate via the CSF following BNCT and that these patients are at high risk for this clinically serious event.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
600,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE. In 1 case, presenting C7 ABC, an Halo Vest was necessary for 30 days, being substituted by a Minerva plaster for three months. 19 patient on 20 are classified as NED (no evidence of disease) at the last F.U. 1 patient as AWD (alive with disease). Discussione e conclusioni: ABC is a benign lesion but in some cases can be locally aggressive causing pain, loss of function, spinal cord, nerve roots or cauda equina compression and pathological fractures. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) was used first as adjuvant procedure to reduce bleeding during surgery. First, De Rosa in 1990 treated ABC using embolization only. Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded
1017,"A comparison of in vivo cellular responses to CS-137 gamma rays and 320-KV X rays Research reported here relates to comparing the relative effectiveness of 320-kV X rays compared to Cs-137 gamma rays for two in vivo endpoints in C.B-17 mice after whole-body exposure: (1) cytotoxicity to bone marrow cells and splenocytes evaluated at 24-hours post exposure and (2) bone marrow and spleen reconstitution deficits (repopulation shortfalls) evaluated at 6 weeks post exposure. We show that cytotoxicity dose-response relationships for bone marrow cells and splenocytes are complex, involving negative curvature (decreasing slope as dose increases), presumably implicating a mixed cell population comprised of large numbers of hypersensitive, modestly radiosensitive, and resistant cells. The radiosensitive cells appear to respond with 50% being killed by a dose < 0.5 Gy. The X-ray relative biological effectiveness (RBE), relative to gamma rays, for destroying bone marrow cells in vivo is > 1, while for destroying splenocytes it is < 1. In contrast, dose-response relationships for reconstitution deficits in the bone marrow and spleen of C.B-17 mice at 6 weeks after radiation exposure were of the threshold type with gamma rays being more effective in causing reconstitution deficit. © 2013 University of Massachusetts.",Excluded
3009,"Assessment of quality of life and oral function of patients participating in a phase II study of radioprotection of oral and pharyngeal mucosa by the prostaglandin E(1) analog misoprostol (RTOG 96-07) PURPOSE: The oral complications associated with radiotherapy to the head and neck are a significant dose-limiting factor. The goals of this study were to determine whether oropharyngeal rinsing and ingestion of misoprostol protect mucous membranes from the acute effects of irradiation, and to evaluate the quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes of patients receiving misoprostol. We report the results of the QOL outcomes of patients in this study., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 33 patients with resected or intact cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, supraglottic larynx, or hypopharynx were registered to receive postoperative radiotherapy plus misoprostol or primary radiotherapy plus misoprostol. All patients were scheduled to receive 60-70 Gy at 2 Gy/d within 6-7 weeks. QOL and function were evaluated., RESULTS: A decrease in the QOL and function occurred in all areas covered by the questionnaire at the 6-week interval. This decrease was significant for eating, saliva, taste, and mucous. Of these significant factors, taste, saliva, and mucous consistency had not resolved by 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: Increased understanding of the impact of treatment on QOL and symptoms will formulate the rational design of toxicity interventions and enhance the multidisciplinary care of head-and-neck patients.",Excluded
3051,"The omentum: an account of its use in the reconstruction of the chest wall Ten patients with lesions of the chest wall amenable to surgical therapy were reconstructed by a transposition flap of the greater omentum. Eight of these patients had been previously treated for cancer of the female breast by mastectomy and irradiation or by irradiation alone (in one instance). Of these 8, 6 had progressive ulceration of the chest wall consistent with radiation necrosis and three had residual carcinoma within the ulcer. One patient had melanoma of the chest wall still persistent after surgical resection and irradiation. Another had epidermoid carcinoma, whereas two sought breast reconstruction after successful mastectomy for cancer. In five patients the omentum was transposed directly on the pleura and lung or chest wall. In three patients prolene mesh was interposed to stabilize the chest wall. In two patients the defect attendant upon a Halsted mastectomy was ameliorated by a one-stage reconstruction using transposed omentum to cover a silastic gel prosthesis and to support an overlying skin graft. In three patients there were mild transient symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction postoperatively. In one patient delayed healing occurred because of partial separation of the omentum from the underlying irradiated pleura and in another there was partial loss of skin graft and omentum due to hematoma.

1605,"Detection of Upper Tract Urothelial Malignancies by Computed Tomography Urography in Patients Referred for Hematuria at a Large Tertiary Referral Center Objective To evaluate the age-stratified prevalence of upper tract urothelial malignancies diagnosed on computed tomography urography in a large cohort of patients referred for initial evaluation of hematuria. Materials and Methods A total of 1123 consecutive adults without a history of urothelial cancer underwent initial computed tomography urography for gross hematuria (n = 652), microscopic hematuria (n = 457), or unspecified hematuria (n = 14) at a single institution from October 2006 to October 2012. Imaging findings suggestive of urothelial lesions were correlated with clinical information, including cystoscopy, cytology, and surgical pathology reports. Patients subsequently diagnosed with urothelial cancer following a normal radiographic evaluation were identified and analyzed. Age, gender, smoking history, and location and type of malignancy were analyzed. Results Upper tract urothelial cancer was detected in 4 (0.36%) patients, with a mean age of 66.5 years. All 4 patients presented with gross hematuria and were current or former smokers. None of the 535 patients under age 55 who underwent computed tomography urography were diagnosed with upper tract disease regardless of age, smoking history, or degree of hematuria. Likewise, no upper tract cancers were detected in patients referred for microscopic hematuria, regardless of age. Conclusion Detection of upper tract urothelial cancer by computed tomography urography is exceedingly rare in patients presenting at a tertiary referral center with hematuria, particularly in the lower risk strata (younger age, microscopic hematuria). Further investigation into risk-stratified approaches to imaging for hematuria workup is warranted to minimize unnecessary costs and radiation exposure.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1680,"68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide SPECT/CT, and whole-body MR imaging in detection of neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective trial Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients (34-77 y old; mean, 54.3 +/- 10.4 y old; 10 men and 9 women) underwent SSRS SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and WB DWI. Images were acquired with a maximum interval of 3 mo between them and were analyzed with masking by separate teams. Planar whole-body imaging and SPECT/CT were performed from thorax to pelvis using a double-head 16-slice SPECT/CT scanner 4 h after injection of 111-185 MBq of 99mTc-HYNIC-octreotide. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was performed from head to feet using a 16-slice PET/CT scanner 45 min after injection of 185 MBq of tracer. WB DWI was performed in the coronal plane using a 1.5-T scanner and a body coil. The standard method of reference for evaluation of image performance was undertaken: consensus among investigators at the end of the study, clinical and imaging follow-up, and biopsy of suggestive lesions., There are different metabolic imaging methods, various tracers, and emerging anatomic modalities to stage neuroendocrine tumor (NET). We aimed to compare NET lesion detectability among 99mTc-hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC)-octreotide (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy [SSRS]) SPECT/CT, 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, and whole-body diffusion-weighted MR imaging (WB DWI)., Results: McNemar testing was applied to evaluate the detectability of lesions using 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in comparison to SSRS SPECT/CT and WB DWI: a significant difference in detectability was noted for pancreas (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455, respectively), gastrointestinal tract (P = 0.0455 and P = 0.0455), and bones (P = 0.0082 and P = 0.0082). Two unknown primary lesions were identified solely by 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, SSRS SPECT/CT, and WB DWI demonstrated, respectively, sensitivities of 0.96, 0.60, and 0.72; specificities of 0.97, 0.99, and 1.00; positive predictive values of 0.94, 0.96, and 1.00; negative predictive values of 0.98, 0.83, and 0.88; and accuracies of 0.97, 0.86, and 0.91., Conclusion: 68Ga PET/CT seems to be more sensitive for detection of well-differentiated NET lesions, especially for bone and unknown primary lesions. NET can be staged with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. WB DWI is an efficient new method with high accuracy and without ionizing radiation exposure. SSRS SPECT/CT should be used only when 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT and WB DWI are not available.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Excluded
2034,"[Comparative research of moxibustion and infrared method in testing heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7) in primary trigeminal neuralgia] To explore the possibility of the infrared objective displaying of heat-sensitive state of acupoint. Fifty-four qualified subjects were enrolled. In the natural state, thermal tomography (TTM) was adopted to shoot the thermograms on the face. After the thermograms collection, the thermo-sensitive detection with moxibustion was applied. The suspending moxibustion with moxa stick was used at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) for 10 mm. The cases with heat extension and transmission at the acupoint were recorded at the end of moxibustion. In following, the second infrared radiation detection was done so as to record the changes in the infrared images on the face before and after moxibustion and compare the difference in the heat-sensitive state at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the subjects between two detection methods. Before moxibustion, the infrared radiation intensity at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side) in the patients displayed mostly low temperature feature and its sensibility (true positive rate) was 65.6%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 68.2% and the accuracy was 66.7%. After moxibustion at Xiaguan (ST 7, affected side), there was an obvious block-diffused increment area of infrared radation along the cheek and its sensitivity (true positive rate) was 81.8%, the specificity (true negative rate) was 81.0% and the accuracy was 81.5% as compared with the moxibustion detection.

3000,"INTESTINE MICROBIOME ASPIRATION (IMBA) CAPSULE: A NEW AUTONOMOUS AND MINIMALLY-INVASIVE DEVICE FOR WHOLE GUT MICROBIOME SAMPLING AND MAPPING BACKGROUND. Intestinal microbiota is closely related to human health. However, our current understandings about intestine microbiota are limited due to its inaccessibility. Invasive and expensive catheter-based sampling methods are not suitable for large-scale studies. So, a reliable, inexpensive and convenient capsule device to collect intestinal microbiome is demanded. Here, we report the Intestine Microbiome Aspiration (IMBA) which aims to collect intestine fluid sample autonomously. Without using expensive MEMS technologies, IMBA utilizes controlled-release technology equipped with an novel sampling mechanism to achieve precise and regional sampling in intestine. METHODS. Three healthy volunteers and three IBS-D volunteers ingested the IMBA capsule with distilled water in their empty stomach in the morning. As shown in Fig. 1, Each capsule has an outer hard gelatin shell with an small intestine (SI)-targeted coating (Eudragit L100-55) that kept the main capsule body intact in the acidic stomach. Once the outer shell dissolved in SI, the capsule body was exposed to the luminal environment, and intestinal fluid flowed into a compartment via four wide channels on the capsule wall. The compartment contained 50mg hydrophilic fibers to wick and retain the fluidic luminal sample. A piston was fixed by a dissolvable spring-loaded latch to keep the channels open initially. The latch gradually dissolved in its thickness until its structure collapsed to release the spring, which pushed the piston to close the channels and seal the samples. The subjects underwent a low-dose X-ray scan every 30 minutes after oral intake of the capsule to monitor the sampling status until the spring was released. Capsules and swabbed fecal samples were collected by the volunteer after their bowel movements in the following 1-2 days, and sent for 16s rRNA analysis. RESULTS. All six capsules completed sampling in the small intestine within 3 hours after oral intake. Each capsule collected 74mg of small intestine luminal contents on average. The microbiota composition was different not only between intestines and feces, but also between healthy volunteers and IBS-D volunteers. Intestinal samples were characterized by increased abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales and Proteobacteria and reduction of Peptostreptococcaceae and Janthinobacterium (Fig. 2). CONCLUSION. The IMBA prototype has proven the concept of ""MEMS-free"" intestine-targeted microbiome sampling technology, a critical step towards personalized whole gut microbiota mapping. The technology offers a safe and reliable solution of capsule-based GI contents sampling while significantly reducing the costs per operation. New designs of large-scale human studies become possible to reveal temporal and spatial variation of gut microbiota for better understanding of its roles in various diseases.

2685,"Associations between urologist financial incentives and imaging use INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Diagnostic imaging use has risen over the last decade contributing to health care costs, as well as patient exposure to ionizing radiation. While studies have examined the role of patient factors in these imaging trends, little is known about how physician financial incentives influence imaging use. Motivated by this, we investigated associations between urologists' imaging use and factors on which their compensation is based. METHOD(S): We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Through specialty codes, we identified those visits to urology clinics. Using explicit codes from the patient record form, we determined the proportion of urology visits at which imaging was ordered. During their induction interview, participating providers indicate if they are full-or part-owners, employees or independent contractors at the office location where they see the most ambulatory patients. Physicians are also asked if their clinical productivity, patient satisfaction or quality of care is taken into account for their compensation (e.g., bonuses). We performed multivariable regression to determine if a patient's receipt of imaging was associated with these financial incentives. RESULT(S): Between 2006 and 2007, over 37 million outpatient visits were made to urologists, during 22.4% (95% CI, 19.0-26.2%) of which imaging was ordered. Imaging was ordered at 24.2% (95% CI, 20.8 - 28.1%) of visits to owners, compared to 13.2% (95% CI, 9.2 - 18.6%) of visits to nonowners (P<0.001). Imaging was ordered at a higher proportion of visits to urologists with clinical productivity incentives vs. those without (27.3% [95% CI, 22.4 - 32.7%] vs. 20.8% [95% CI, 16.8 - 25.4%], P=0.049). The odds of having an imaging study ordered were 2-fold greater at an owner's office (p = 0.001). Visits to urologists with productivity incentives had a 43% higher odds of imaging (p = 0.05). These associations persisted after adjusting for patient characteristics (age, sex, race, comorbidity, urban/rural residence) and geographic region (Table). No association was found for financial incentives related to patient satisfaction or clinical quality. CONCLUSION(S): Independent of patient characteristics, imaging use at ambulatory urology visits is associated with provider financial incentives. (Table Presented).",Excluded
3192,"Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy to distal ureteric stones: The transgluteal approach significantly increases stone-free rates What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) can be used to treat stones at any position within the ureter, as long as the stone is radio-opaque and there is a path for the shockwave to reach the stone. However the results of SWL to distal ureteric calculi, with the patient in a prone position, were inferior to those of treating stones within the upper ureter. The transguteal approach allows the lithotripsy shockwave to reach the lower ureter via the greater selatle foramen. This study shows that this approach for SWL to distal ureteric calculi is more effective than the prone approach. Objective To compare the outcomes of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for distal ureteric stones treated using the prone and transgluteal (supine) approaches in a tertiary referral stone unit using a fourth generation lithotriptor. Patients and Methods We selected consecutive patients undergoing ESWL to distal ureteric stones over 1 year, during which we changed our treatment protocol from a prone to transgluteal (supine) approach. Patients were treated using the Sonolith Vision Lithotriptor (Technomed Medical Systems, Vaulx-en-Velin, France). Outcome was assessed using plain abdominal film of kidney, ureter and bladder (KUB) X-ray taken at 2 weeks then monthly as required. Treatment success was defined as complete clearance of stone fragments and treatment failure was defined as persistence of stone fragments beyond 3 months or the need for ureteroscopy. Results A total of 38 patients were treated in the prone position and 72 patients using a transgluteal approach. Patient and stone characteristics were identical in both groups. The mean (range) stone size was 7.8 (4-16) mm. The proportions of patients who were stone-free after one treatment session within the prone and transgluteal treatment groups were 40 and 78%, respectively (<0.001). The overall success rates for treatment within the prone and transgluteal groups were 63 and 92%, respectively (<0.001). Conclusions Transgluteal ESWL to stones within the distal ureter leads to significantly higher stone-free rates than treatment using the prone approach. The majority of patients are rendered stone-free after one session of treatment and the overall success rates are similar to those of ureteroscopic management. © 2013 BJU International.",Excluded
354,"Left bundle branch block and suspected myocardial infarction: Does chronicity of the branch block matter? Background: Our aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB). Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence of ST-segment concordance in this population. Method(s): Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at Orebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or >=80 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. Result(s): A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group >=80 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. Conclusion(s): The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test. © The European Society of Cardiology 2013.",Excluded
3465,"Radiotherapy in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: clinical and dosimetric aspects As a result of aging, the number of patients with cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) requiring radiotherapy (RT) continues to rise. The aim of this work was to evaluate RT-related malfunctions of CIED in a cohort of patients who underwent RT in our clinic from June 2010 to December 2016. We retrospectively analyzed 93 RT treatments in 63 patients with CIEDs. Patients were treated with 3D conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT and stereotactic RT. We collected clinical characteristics of cancer, models of CIEDs, total RT dose to tumor and radiation energy. Radiation dose delivered to CIED and its dysfunctions after RT was evaluated. Subgroup analysis of 48 RT treatments (32 patients) on chest and neck plus on 13 RT treatments (12 patients) with 18 MV neutron-producing photon energy considered as high risk was performed. The number of treatments of patients with CIEDs increased from 0.3% in 2011 to 1.2% in 2016. Two patients, treated with 18 MV photon beam, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that received a maximum dose of around 2.1 Gy, experienced adverse events: a reprogramming of ICD when the patient reached a delivered dose to the tumor of 32 Gy, and an altered sensing function requiring replacement after 11 months from the end of RT. Nearly 2% of patients with CIEDs from high-risk patients subgroup had experienced a damage of the device. Close cooperation between radiation oncologists, cardiologists, medical physicists and radiation technologists is needed to achieve the best practice management in these patients.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
1380,"Factors influencing patient reported cosmetic outcome: Results of the Young Boost Trial Purpose or Objective: The Young Boost trial (YBT), a multicenter RCT (NCT00212121), investigates whether a higher boost dose leads to a lower recurrence rate in young patients treated with breast conserving therapy. Cosmetic outcome is the secondary objective. The aim of the current analysis is to investigate the factors influencing the patients' opinion about cosmesis. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2004-2011, 2421 breast cancer patients <= 50 y rs w ere i ncluded i n T he Netherlands, France, and Germany. All patients were treated with lumpectomy, followed by 50 Gy whole breast irradiation. Patients were randomized to receive a standard 16 Gy (n=1211) or a high 26 Gy boost (n=1210) to the tumour bed. Cosmetic outcome data at 4 years of 807 patients were used for the current analysis according to the following two scoring systems: 1. BCCT.core: Digital photographs were analyzed using a software program to extract an overall cosmetic score: excellent, good, fair or poor. This score is based on symmetry, skin color and scar visibility. The 7 features of symmetry in the BCCT.core program are: nipple position (pBRA), level of lower breast contour (pLBC), level of nipple (pUNR), distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE), length of breast contour (pBCD), area of the breast (pBAD) and non-overlapping area between left and right breast (pBOD). 2. Patients' score using a validated patient's questionnaire about the breast appearance, including an overall score: very satisfied, satisfied, not dissatisfied, dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. First, we analyzed the 7 features of BCCT.core in a proportional odds model, to investigate which parameters were related to the patients' opinion about cosmesis. In addition, we analyzed whether firmness, presence of rib pain or quality of life (QoL) aspects (EORTC QLQ C-30 questionnaire) at 4 years were related to the patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome. Result(s): Of the 7 BCCT.core parameters, pBCE and pBCD were significantly related to patients' score at 4 years. Patients with any difference in firmness rated their cosmesis worse than patients without any difference, even when the objective score (i.e. BCCT.core) was similar. This effect was larger by increasing difference. Worse perception of cosmetic outcome was also independently related to lower global QoL, lower emotional functioning and higher scores in the depression scale. The presence of rib pain had no influence. Conclusion(s): The patients' opinion on cosmetic outcome was significantly related to objective parameters like distance from nipple to inframammary fold (pBCE) and length of breast contour (pBCD), but also to subjective factors, i.e. severity of firmness, depressive feelings, global QoL and emotional functioning.",Excluded

2043,"New and evolving concepts in CT for abdominal vascular imaging Computed tomographic (CT) angiography has become the standard of care, supplanting invasive angiography for comprehensive initial evaluation of acute and chronic conditions affecting the vascular system in the abdomen and elsewhere. Over the past decade, the capabilities of CT have improved substantially; simultaneously, the expectations of the referring physician and vascular surgeons have also evolved. Increasingly, CT angiography is used as an imaging biomarker for treatment selection and assessment of effectiveness. However, the growing use of CT angiography has also introduced some challenges, as potential radiation-associated and contrast media-induced risks need to be addressed. These concerns can be partly confronted by modifying scanning parameters (applying a low tube voltage) with or without using software-based solutions. Most recently, multienergy technology has endowed CT with new capabilities offering improved CT angiographic image quality and novel plaque characterization while decreasing radiation and iodine dose. In this article, we discuss current and new approaches using both conventional and multienergy CT for studying vascular disease in the abdomen. We propose various approaches to overcoming commonly encountered image quality challenges in CT angiography. In addition, we describe supplemental strategies for improving patient safety that leverage the available technology.Copyright ©RSNA, 2014.",Excluded
792,"Radiosurgery for lung metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiosurgery (HFSR) is a noninvasive focused beam technique that delivers high-dose radiation. Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery for metastatic RCC to the lung offers a generally well-tolerated, noninvasive treatment method with a high rate of tumor control. Patients will continue to be evaluated for longer follow-up, possible benefits of metastatic cancer treatment and survival advantage. HFSR remains an option for those whom standard approaches have not produced desired results or in patients seeking an alternative to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment.",Excluded
3423,"Mortality Among International Astronauts INTRODUCTION: Research on the mortality of space explorers has focused exclusively on U.S. astronauts and Soviet and Russian cosmonauts. However, other nations have organized space programs over the last 40 yr and the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency, the China National Space Administration, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency all offer an opportunity for further study of the mortality of space explorers. METHODS: We used biographical and vital data abstracted from public sources for European, Canadian, Chinese, and Japanese astronauts. Using general population mortality rates from the Human Mortality Database and mortality rates derived from the cohort of U.S. astronauts, we computed standardized mortality ratios. RESULTS: The groups displayed different preferences in selection of astronauts. As there were no deaths in any of the four groups, the point estimates for standardized mortality ratios were all 0. However, the European cohort experienced a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality risk in comparison to the European general population as well as in comparison to U.S. astronauts. DISCUSSION: The healthy worker effect predicts that all study cohorts should have lower all-cause mortality risk in comparison to their general populations. The general population of Japan has mortality rates low enough that any reduction in mortality risk may remain undetectable in the Japanese cohort. Continued surveillance of these populations in the coming decades will make them a useful addition to the evidence base for astronaut mortality. Reynolds RJ, Day SM.

2161,"Cytogenetic status of interventional radiology unit workers occupationally exposed to low-dose ionising radiation: A pilot study Interventional radiology unit workers represent one of the occupationally most exposed populations to low-dose ionizing radiation. Since there are many uncertainties in research of doses below 100 mSv, this study attempted to evaluate DNA damage levels in chronically exposed personnel. The study group consisted of 24 subjects matched with a control population by the number of participants, age, gender ratio, active smoking status, the period of blood sampling, and residence. Based on regular dosimetry using thermoluminiscent dosimeters, our study group occupationally received a dose of 1.82 +/- 3.60 mSv over the last year. The results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and the comet assay showed a higher nuclear buds frequency (4.09 +/- 1.88) and tail length (15.46 +/- 1.47 mum) than in the control group (2.96 +/- 1.67, 14.05 +/- 1.36 mum, respectively). Differences in other descriptors from both tests did not reach statistical significance. Further investigations are needed to develop algorithms for improving personal dosimetry and those that would engage larger biomonitoring study groups. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

1086,"Quantification and characterization of radical production in human, animal and 3D skin models during sun irradiation measured by EPR spectroscopy Sun radiation is indispensable to our health, however, a long term and high exposure could lead to erythema, premature skin aging and promotion of skin tumors. An underlying pathomechanism is the formation of free radicals. First, reactive oxygen species (*OH, *O2 -) and then, secondary lipid oxygen species (C centered radicals, CCR) are formed. A high amount of free radicals results in oxidative stress with subsequent cell damage. In dermatological research different skin models are used, however, comparative data about the cutaneous radical formation are missing. In this study, the radical formation in porcine-, (SKH-1) murine-, human- ex vivo skin and reconstructed human skin (RHS) were investigated during simulated sun irradiation (305-2200 nm), with X-band EPR spectroscopy. The amount of radical formation was investigated with the spin probe PCA exposed to a moderate sun dose below one minimal erythema dose (MED, ~25 mJ/cm2 UVB) in all skin models. Furthermore, the *OH and *CCR radical concentrations were measured with the spin trap DMPO within 0-4 MED (porcine-, human skin and RHS). The highest amount of radicals was found in RHS followed by murine and porcine, and the lowest amount in human ex vivo skin. In all skin models, more *OH than CCR radicals were found at 0-4 MED. Additionally, this work addresses the limitations in the characterization with the spin trap DMPO. The measurements have shown that the most comparable skin model to in vivo human skin could differ depending on the focus of the investigation. If the amount of radial production is regarded, RHS seems to be in a similar range like in vivo human skin. If the investigation is focused on the radical type, porcine skin is most comparable to ex vivo human skin, at an irradiation dose not exceeding 1 MED. Here, no comparison to in vivo human skin is possible.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1776,"Effect of antisecretory therapy on atypical symptoms in gastroesophageal reflux disease The effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy on extraesophageal or atypical manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of atypical manifestations in patients with acid reflux disease and the effect of PPI treatment. Patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of reflux were enrolled. Erosive esophagitis was stratified using the Los Angeles classification. Demographic data and symptoms were assessed using a questionnaire and included typical symptoms (heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, odynophagia), and atypical symptoms (e.g., chest pain, sialorrhea, hoarseness, globus sensation, chronic coughing, episodic bronchospasm, hiccup, eructations, laryngitis, and pharyngitis). Symptoms were reassessed after a 3-month course of b.i.d. PPI therapy. A total of 266 patients with a first diagnosis of GERD (erosive, 166; non-erosive, 100) were entered in the study. Presentation with atypical symptoms was approximately equal in those with erosive GERD and with non-erosive GERD, 72% vs 79% (P = 0.18). None of the study variables showed a significant association with the body mass index. PPI therapy resulted in complete symptom resolution in 69% (162/237) of the participants, 12% (28) had improved symptoms, and 20% (47) had minimal or no improvement. We conclude that atypical symptoms are frequent in patients with GERD. A trial of PPI therapy should be considered prior to referring these patients to specialists.",Excluded
1689,"The association of residential altitude on the molecular profile and survival of melanoma: Results of an interreg study Cutaneous melanoma (CM) incidence is rising worldwide and is the primary cause of death from skin disease in the Western world. Personal risk factors linked to environmental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are well-known etiological factors contributing to its development. Nevertheless, UVR can contribute to the development of CM in different patterns and to varying degrees. The present study aimed at investigating whether altitude of residence can contribute to the development of specific types of CM and/or influence its progression. To this aim, 306 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from primary CM diagnosed in different geographical areas were submitted to B-RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and N-RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (NRAS) mutational status detection and mRNA and miRNA profiling by qPCR. Genes were chosen for their functions in specific processes, such as immune response (CD2, PDL1, or CD274) and pigmentation (MITF, TYRP1, and TRPM1). Furthermore, four microRNAs, namely miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-204-5p, and miR-211-5p, were included in the profiling. Our results highlight differences in the gene expression profile of primary CM with respect to the geographical area and the altitude of residence. Melanoma-specific survival was influenced by the gene expression of mRNA and miRNAs and varied with the altitude of patients' residence. In detail, TYRP1 and miR-204-5p were highly expressed in patients living at higher altitudes, unlike miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-211-5p. Since miRNAs are highly regulated by reactive oxygen species, it is possible that different regulatory mechanisms characterize CMs at different altitudes due to the different environment and UVR intensity.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

2922,"The effect of electromagnetic field emitted by a mobile phone on the inhibitory control of saccades OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether exposure to a pulsed high-frequency electromagnetic field (pulsed EMF) emitted by a mobile phone has short-term effects on the inhibitory control of saccades., METHODS: A double-blind, counterbalanced crossover study design was employed. We assessed the performance of 10 normal subjects on antisaccade (AS) and cued saccade (CUED) tasks as well as two types of overlap saccade (OL1, OL2) task before and after 30 min of exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone or sham exposure., RESULTS: After EMF or sham exposure, we observed a slight but significant shortening of latency in the CUED and OL2 tasks. AS amplitude decreased as well as the saccade velocities in the AS, CUED, and OL1 tasks after exposure. These changes occurred regardless of whether exposure was real or sham. The frequencies of pro-saccades in the AS task, saccades to cue in the CUED task, and prematurely initiated saccades in the overlap (OL2) task did not change significantly after real or sham EMF exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Thirty minutes of mobile phone exposure has no significant short-term effect on the inhibitory control of saccades., SIGNIFICANCE: The cortical processing responsible for saccade inhibition is not affected by exposure to EMF emitted by a mobile phone.

1659,"Selection of comparable anatomical locations of muscle cross-sectional images in the Osteoarthritis Initiative MRI data Purpose: Muscle forces and cross sectional areas (CSA) play an important role in the onset and progression of OA. The OA Initiative provides images of muscle CSAs of both limbs. These images are acquired starting 10 cm proximally of the distal epiphyseal line of the femur and cover 15 slices of 0.5 mm (7.5 cm) in proximal direction. The images therefore have a variable anatomical location with regard to the femur and thigh muscles in short and tall individuals, and this poses limits on the comparability between participants in cross sectional studies. The objectives were therefore to determine a) the location of the 15 slices in relation to the femur (%length) in persons with variable body height, b) which part of the femur (% length) is covered in all subjects, and c) whether the inter-subject variability of the location of these cross sectional images (versus the femoral length) can be effectively reduced, when accounting for differences in body height. Method(s): Clinical data, MR images of the thigh muscles, and full limb X-rays from 48 OA participants with calculated Kellgren Lawrence grade 3 were studied (OAI public data sets 0.2.2, 0.E.1, 1.E.1). The subjects were selected to cover the full body height distribution in men and women. In the women (n=24), the body height ranged from 151.1 to 180.2 cm, and in the men (n=24) from 162.8 to 188.8 cm. From the full-limb X-rays, the femoral length (distance of the knee joint space to the proximal end of the femoral head was determined in vertical direction. The position of the epiphyseal line (in the femur) was measured in MRI scout views which were used to plan the thigh muscle MRI acquisitions. Result(s): The femoral length (F) in the full-limb X-rays varied from 47.3 to 55.1 cm in men, and from 44.2 to 55.9 cm in women The relationship between F and the body height (H) was similar in men and women (F=29.4% of H in women [min:27.5%, max:31.5%], and F=30.0% of H in men [min: 27.9%, max:33.8%]). Linear regression analysis provided the equations F=0.29xH mm + 15.7mm for men (r2=63%) and F=0.33 x Hmm - 51.93mm for women (r2=57%) as estimates of F. The epiphyseal line was clearly visible in 24 of the 48 MRI scout views; its relative position in the femur (from distal) was 6.0% in women (min:3.4%; max:8.5%), and 7.2% in men (min:5.5%, max:8.8%), The location was significantly different (p=0.03) between sexes. From these data, it was derived that a region of 29.4% to 36.7% of the femoral length (from distal) was covered by the 15 axial MRI muscle slices in all men, and a region between 31.1% and 35.7% in all women, across the full range of body heights. Therefore a target slice located at 33% of F (from distal to proximal) was selected, so that all participants could be included in a measurement, independent of body height. This location corresponded to slice No7 (from distal to proximal) in a person of average height (=mean across the 48 subjects). When selecting slice No7 in every participant, its location varied between 30% and 37% of the femoral length (standard deviation [SD]=1.5%). When choosing the most appropriate slice after accounting for differences in body height (slice number 4 to 9), its location varied only between 32.5% and 33.5% (SD=0.3%). Conclusion(s): Measurement of the femoral length and the epiphyseal line allows for the precise selection of comparable slices for measuring muscle CSAs in subjects with different heights. In cases where no full limb radiographs are available, the use of body height (H) as an estimate of femoral length (F) can reduce the variability of the slice location as expressed by the standard deviation by a factor of 5 compared with choosing the same slice across all subjects.",Excluded
2766,"Surgical Selection of Unstable Intertrochanteric Fractures: PFNA Combined with or without Cerclage Cable Due to the instability of unstable intertrochanteric fractures, the selection of a suitable internal fixation has always been a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. This study is aimed at comparing the clinical efficacy of PFNA combined with cerclage cable and without cerclage cable and finally recommend a stable internal fixation method to provide the basis for clinical therapy. From January 2014 to January 2018, we retrospectively analyzed all cases of unstable intertrochanteric fractures who received treatment in the Orthopedics Department of our hospital and finally screened 120 cases, 51 of whom were treated with cerclage cable, 69 without cerclage cable. The follow-up period was one year. HHS, BI, and RUSH scores were given within the specified time. We divided the patients into the PFNA+cable (PFNA combined with cerclage cable) group and the PFNA group. The time of fracture healing and weight-bearing in the PFNA+cable group was shorter than that in the PFNA group. With regard to HHS, BI, and RUSH, the PFNA+cable group was higher than the PFNA group at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after operation. For HHS rating, the PFNA+cable group has a higher excellent rate than the PFNA group, which was 96.1% and 84.1%, respectively. All the results mentioned above were statistically significant. Compared with the group without cerclage cable, the application of cerclage cable can reduce the incidence of complications. From the comparison between the two groups, it can be seen that the surgical method of PFNA combined with cerclage cable can not only help to improve the stability of fracture reduction, shorten the time of fracture healing and postoperative weight-bearing, and significantly improve patients' self-care ability but also reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. Therefore, we think PFNA combined with cerclage cable is a good choice.Copyright © 2021 Chaoqing Huang and Xing Wu.",Excluded
462,"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and early vascular aging from long-term low-dose ionizing radiation exposure: a genetic, telomere, and vascular ultrasound study in cardiac catheterization laboratory staff OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis.",Included

When failure rarely occurs, some controversy has existed as to whether the tumor has to be resected or can be safely retreated with radiosurgery. The authors retrospectively studied the outcome of retreating 11 patients with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS)., METHODS: The authors studied 11 patients at the New England Gamma Knife Center who had undergone GKS as a second radiosurgical treatment for VS from 1994 to 2007. One patient underwent proton-beam radiotherapy as the first treatment, and the other 10 patients had undergone GKS initially. Tumor control (size before and after the first and the second treatment) was evaluated using MR imaging to demonstrate the course after the 2 treatments. Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grading system), trigeminal nerve function, hearing (Gardner-Robertson classification), and any adverse radiation effects were evaluated. The prescription dose was 12 Gy (11-13.2 Gy) for both treatments., RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 2 showed increase, 1 had no change, and, in 8, the VS decreased in size after the retreatment. One tumor remained unchanged over the first 6 months, but demonstrated signs of internal necrosis. All patients demonstrated stable facial nerve function. Regarding facial numbness, 2 patients experienced increases, 8 no change, and 1 decreased numbness. There was no functional hearing prior to the second treatment in 10 patients, and hearing was impaired in 1 patient. Adverse radiation effects (slight peduncular edema) were seen in 2 patients after the second treatment, and 1 patient had edema after the first treatment as well., CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular schwannomas can be retreated with GKS with good tumor control response and low risk of toxicity.",Excluded
312,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Method(s): Relative risks and excess relative risks per unit dose (ERR/Gy) were calculated based on the maximum likelihood using Epicure software (Hirosoft International Corporation, Seattle, WA). Dose estimates used in analyses were provided by an updated ""Mayak Worker Dosimetry System-2008"". Result(s): A significant increasing linear trend in IHD incidence with total dose from external g-rays was observed after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from internal radiation {ERR/Gy50.10 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04 to 0.17]}. The pure quadratic model provided a better fit of the data than did the linear one. No significant association of IHD mortality with total dose from external g-rays after having adjusted for nonradiation factors and dose from internal alpha radiation was observed in the study cohort [ERR/Gy50.06 (95% CI: ,0 to 0.15)]. A significant increasing linear trend was observed in IHD mortality with total absorbed dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and dose from external g-rays in both the whole cohort [ERR/Gy50.21 (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.58)] and the subcohort of workers exposed at alpha dose ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy51.08 (95% CI: 0.34 to 2.15)]. No association of IHD incidence with total dose from internal alpha radiation to the liver was found in the whole cohort after having adjusted for non-radiation factors and external gamma dose [ERR/Gy50.02 (95% CI: not available to 0.10)]. Statistically significant dose effect was revealed in the subcohort of workers exposed to internal alpha radiation at dose to the liver ,1.00Gy [ERR/Gy50.44 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.85)].

2319,"In-vivo longitudinal imaging of microvascular changes in irradiated oral mucosa of radiotherapy cancer patients using optical coherence tomography Mucositis is the limiting toxicity of radio(chemo)therapy of head and neck cancer. Diagnostics, prophylaxis and correction of this condition demand new accurate and objective approaches. Here we report on an in vivo longitudinal monitoring of the oral mucosa dynamics in 25 patients during the course of radiotherapy of oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cancer using multifunctional optical coherence tomography (OCT). A spectral domain OCT system with a specially-designed oral imaging probe was used. Microvasculature visualization was based on temporal speckle variations of the full complex signal evaluated by high-pass filtering of 3D data along the slow scan axis. Angiographic image quantification demonstrated an increase of the vascular density and total length of capillary-like-vessels before visual signs or clinical symptoms of mucositis occur. Especially significant microvascular changes compared to their initial levels occurred when grade two and three mucositis developed. Further, microvascular reaction was seen to be dose-level dependent. OCT monitoring in radiotherapy offers a non-invasive, convenient, label-free quantifiable structural and functional volumetric imaging method suitable for longitudinal human patient studies, furnishing fundamental radiobiological insights and potentially providing useful feedback data to enable adaptive radiotherapy (ART).",Excluded

1947,"Unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei analyses in the biomonitoring of workers occupationally exposed to ionising radiation The quantification of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes is a method commonly used in biodosimetry by cytogenetic analysis, especially when physical dosimetry cannot be performed. In this context, the aim of this research was to compare these methods in the biomonitoring of health professionals occupationally exposed to ionising radiation. In parallel, the C-banding technique was applied to confirm the presence of unstable chromosomal aberrations (dicentrics and rings). For this, samples of peripheral blood from health professionals of three hospitals (Recife - Brazil) were collected and lymphocyte cultures were carried out based on classical cytogenetic techniques. The number of cells scored per subject was the same (1000) for each assay. Among the individuals, those who do not usually wear a lead apron had higher frequencies of unstable chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei than the ones who carefully observe the radioprotection rules.

To determine the tolerance doses of cutaneous and mucosal tissues of normal birds in order to provide more effective radiation treatment for tumors that have been shown to be radiation responsive in other species, ingluvial mucosa and the skin over the ingluvies of 9 ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) were irradiated in 4-Gy fractions to a total dose of either 48, 60, or 72 Gy using an isocentric cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. Minimal radiation-induced epidermal changes were present in the high-dose group histologically. Neither dose-related acute nor chronic radiation effects could be detected in any group grossly in cutaneous or mucosal tissue over a 9-month period. Radiation doses of 72 Gy in 4-Gy fractions were well tolerated in the small number of ring-necked parakeets in this initial tolerance dose study.",Included
2598,"Computer-aided pulmonary nodule detection - performance of two CAD systems at different CT dose levels PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose reduction on the performance of computer-aided lung nodule detection systems (CAD) of two manufacturers by comparing respective CAD results on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) data sets of 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, patients 31 - 74 years old) were retrospectively selected for CAD analysis. Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets., RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2). For both CAD systems there were no significant differences between the detection rates for standard and ultra-low-dose data sets (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of the underlying CT scan did not significantly influence nodule detection performance of the tested CAD systems.",Excluded
2971,"Occupational health hazards of working in the interventional laboratory: a multisite case control study of physicians and allied staff BACKGROUND: The occupational hazards of working in the interventional laboratory have been inadequately studied for physicians and remain unaddressed for nonphysician personnel., OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine whether the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal pain, cancer, and other medical conditions is higher among physicians and allied staff who work in interventional laboratories compared with employees who do not., METHODS: Mayo Clinic employees who work in affiliated hospitals with interventional cardiology or interventional radiology laboratories took an electronic survey. Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

1938,"Cardiac exposure in the dynamic conformal arc therapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy of lung cancer Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the cardiac exposure in three cohorts of lung cancer patients treated with dynamic conformal arc therapy (DCAT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), or volumetricmodulated arc therapy (VMAT) at our institution in the past seven years. Methods and Materials: A total of 140 lung cancer patients were included in this institutional review board approved study: 25 treated with DCAT, 70 with IMRT and 45 with VMAT. All plans were generated in a same commercial treatment planning system and have been clinically accepted and delivered. The dose distribution to the heart and the effects of tumor laterality, the irradiated heart volume and the beam-to-heart distance on the cardiac exposure were investigated. Result(s): The mean dose to the heart among all 140 plans was 4.5 Gy. Specifically, the heart received on average 2.3, 5.2 and 4.6 Gy in the DCAT, IMRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The mean heart doses for the left and right lung tumors were 4.1 and 4.8 Gy, respectively. No patients died with evidence of cardiac disease. Three patients (2%) with preexisting cardiac condition developed cardiac disease after treatment. Furthermore, the cardiac exposure was found to increase linearly with the irradiated heart volume while decreasing exponentially with the beam-to-heart distance. Conclusion(s): Compared to old technologies for lung cancer treatment, modern radiotherapy treatment modalities demonstrated better heart sparing. But the heart dose in lung cancer radiotherapy is still higher than that in the radiotherapy of breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease where cardiac complications have been extensively studied. With strong correlations of mean heart dose with beam-to-heart distance and irradiated heart volume, cautions should be exercised to avoid long-term cardiac toxicity in the lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.Copyright © 2015 Ming et al.

279,"Role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in DNA strand break repair through homologous recombination In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded

480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded
2676,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: A planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Result(s): The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p<0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p<0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",Excluded
771,"Prospects of application of new photosensitizer Elophit"" in photodynamic therapy for treating some dermatologic diseases"" Purpose: Purpose of the present work was to study photosensitizer (PS) Elophit"" effectiveness for PDT sessions in some dermatologic diseases. Material(s) and Method(s): Gel ""Elophit"" is a complex substance containing chlorins E6 (0.5%), copper chlorophyllin (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (2%) (conformance certificate No. ROSS RU.IM; 25130 2322). Therapeutic effects are produced not only due to the chlorin E6 photodynamic (PDT) action but also due to the action of copper derivatives which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. The preparation easily penetrates into the skin and accumulates in inflammatory foci. Gel ""Elophit"" was put on skin lesions 40 min before PDT session. Before the session preparation remnants were removed off the skin with a mild alcohol solution. PDT was performed in 12 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form) (4 males, 8 females), 8 patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (5 males, 3 females). Controls were 24 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form), 20 patients with streptostaphylodermias. Age - 17-58 years old, disease duration from 1 week to 6 years. Patients from the control group received traditional therapy without PDT component. Device ""Soljaris"" with incorporated diodes in the range 660 mum, irradiation power 400 mW was used as a light source. Irradiation was done in a scan manner (70-270 J/cm2). Sessions - twice a week. Research results were assessed by changes in the clinical picture using biophometry techniques with laser therapeutic apparatus ""Milta F-8-01"" having an in-built biophotometer. These changes are shown in photomaterials. FS accumulation degree in the skin was determined with spectrometry (apparatus ""LESA-01-BIOSPEC""). Result(s): A complete rash regression after 4-8 PDT sessions (in 2 weeks - 1 month) was seen in 8 (66.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris, in 5 (62.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia; in the rest of patients a considerable clinical improvement was seen. No changes in clinical picture during PDT treatment was seen in 2 (16.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 1 (12.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia. In the controls one month later a clinical remission was seen in 10 (41.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 11 (55%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, no changes - in 7 (29.1%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 6 (30%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, in the rest of patients - a partial rash regression. A fluorescent examination has shown less FS fluorescence (by 60-75%) in the skin after irradiation what indicates a marked phodynamic effect with a considerable discharge of singlet oxygen. Clinical observations have been confirmed by the results of biophotometric examinations of skin lesions when one could see changes typical for decreased or resorpted inflammatory processes. Conclusion(s): Thus, as it has been shown by preliminary findings PDT with photosensitizer ""Elophit"" may be an effective technique for treating some dermatologic pathologies. Further researches are needed to study better effectiveness of PDT with gel ""Elophit"" application in dermatologic practice so as to determine indications and to develop optimal schemes for treatment.""",Excluded

2032,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included
1319,"Preclinical studies with the Faure high energy neutron facility: response of pig skin to fractionated doses of fast neutrons (66 MeVp----Be) The early and late responses of pig skin to fractionated doses of both unfiltered and filtered (i.e. hardened) neutrons using the Faure neutron therapy facility (66 MeVp----Be) were determined and compared with those following fractionated doses with 60Co gamma-rays. Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy. In order to provide a comparison, the values for 24 fractions of 60Co gamma-rays given in 39 days (a clinical protocol used in the Groote Schuur Hospital) were 74.02 +/- 2.92 and 66.72 +/- 1.93 Gy for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis, respectively. For the unfiltered beam, values for the comparative biological effectiveness (CBE) were 3.96 and 3.00 for the early and late skin response, respectively. The corresponding CBE values were for the filtered beam 2.99 and 2.86. These results for the Faure neutron therapy facility can be extrapolated to the human situation with a high degree of confidence, so that the neutron dose which would yield acceptable skin damage in patients may be determined using the data presented here.",Included

Previous ground-based research has indicated around a 50% occurrence of both venous gas emboli (VGE) and symptoms of decompression illness (DCI) after similar decompressions. In contrast, no DCI symptoms have been reported from past or current space activities. Twenty subjects were studied using Doppler ultrasound to detect any VGE during decompression to 386hPa, where they remained for up to 6h. Subjects were supine to simulate weightlessness. A large number of VGE were found in one subject at rest, who had a recent arm fracture; a small number of VGE were found in another subject during provocation with calf contractions. No changes in exhaled nitric oxide were found that can be related to either simulated EVA or actual EVA (studied in a parallel study on four cosmonauts). We conclude that weightlessness appears to be protective against DCI and that exhaled NO is not likely to be useful to monitor VGE.",Excluded
1398,"DNA-protein crosslinks as a biomarker of exposure to solar radiation: a preliminary study in brick-kiln workers In India, fired clay bricks are produced in small-scale factories. There are 60, 000 active brick kilns, providing employment to nearly 12 million people in different suboccupations. This industry is largely non-mechanized and operates from November to June. Almost all the workers are exposed to direct sunlight for 8-10 h a day. Cellular DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are the biologically active nucleoprotein complexes formed between DNA and proteins. Ultraviolet light and gamma-rays, and other suspected carcinogens in humans, induce DPC formation in blood cells. DPCs have therefore been identified as a biomarker for monitoring exposure to these hazardous agents. Here we report steady-state levels of DPCs in human peripheral lymphocytes from 46 brick-kiln workers exposed occupationally for 8-10 h a day to solar radiation in brickfields and 25 unexposed controls. A significant increase (p <0.05) in DPC content and DPC coefficients in peripheral lymphocytes was observed in the brick-kiln workers compared with the controls. The data suggest that the DPC content of lymphocytes could be a possible biomarker of exposure to solar radiation. However, further work is necessary to confirm this.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach. Capecitabine as targeted therapy given with each fraction of radiotherapy and administered orally may have significant advantages over intravenous, 3 weekly cisplatin. © 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded

It has been reported that decreasing the surface dose reduces patient morbidity, especially facial weakness and numbness. The authors of this retrospective study examine patient data from a single center to determine if low-dose ( 14 Gy). METHOD(S): Based on the formula for ellipsoid volumes, the tumor volumes were calculated using measurements from MR images obtained at follow up in patients treated at the authors' center. Follow-up data were available in 159 patients with a mean age of 59.5 +/- 14.2 years at treatment. Fifty-six percent of the patients were women and 53.5% of the tumors were located on the right side of the brain. The mean tumor volume was 3.3 +/- 4.3 cm3 with 10% of the tumors having volumes larger than 8 cm3. After GKS, smaller tumors (> or = 40% decrease in volume) were observed in 44.8% of patients treated with a low dose and in 48.8% treated with a high dose. Enlarged tumors (> or = 40% increase in volume) were seen in 5.2% of the patients receiving a low dose and 2.3% of those receiving a high dose. These differences were not statistically significant. Patients who had been followed up for longer than 5 years after treatment had median residual volumes of only 28.2% of the starting volume in the low-dose group and 26% in the high-dose group.

Investigate whether percutaneous spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads migrate significantly during a 3-day trial, and determine whether the skin anchoring method influences lead migration. Material and Methods. Twenty patients were prospectively enrolled. Ten leads were anchored with suture and tape and 10 were anchored with tape only. A standardized X-ray protocol of lead position was obtained immediately following lead placement and upon completion of the trial. Results. Using a standardized method, SCS leads were measured and movement was calculated. The average movement for leads anchored with tape only was 8.72mm (SD=5.77), inferiorly; while movement for leads anchored with suture and tape was 24.49mm (SD=11.3), inferiorly. A t-test revealed a significant difference between the groups (t=3.9, P=0.001). Conclusions. Percutaneous SCS trial electrodes migrate significantly, inferiorly, during a 3-day trial. Anchoring the trial electrodes to the skin with a suture and tape results in significantly greater inferior migration when compared with anchoring the lead with tape only.

747,"Dose-escalation with CHARTWEL (continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy week-end less) combined with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer PURPOSE: a radiation-dose-escalation study was undertaken to assess the therapeutic benefit of combining accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy (RT) with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients with locally advanced NSCLC were entered into a phase II trial of CHARTWEL (CHART Week-End-Less) 54 Gy or 60 Gy with or without three cycles of CT. Acute oesophageal reactions and analgesia were scored for up to 8 weeks after the start of RT. Pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, spinal cord and oesophageal strictures, were assessed using clinical and radiological criteria from 3 months onwards and throughout the study. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was monitored in those patients undergoing CT. Endpoints for treatment outcome were overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional control., RESULTS: Chemotherapy enhanced the incidence and duration of acute dysphagia,but the increase was transient. Healing occurred in all cases and there has been no evidence of long-term oesophageal complications. Clinically, almost 25% of those receiving CT+RT had Grade 2 pneumonitis, higher than seen with RT alone. However, the 1 patient with severe Grade 3 pneumonitis was in the RT 60 Gy alone group. An incidence of 17% Grade 2 pulmonary fibrosis at 2 years was seen with CT, slightly lower than with RT alone. To date, there is no evidence of Grade 3 lung fibrosis. There was a higher scoring of lung damage with the radiological endpoint, which gave no indication that CT increased pulmonary toxicity over that of RT alone. Loco-regional control at 2 years was 37% and 55% for CHARTWEL 54 Gy and 60 Gy alone compared with 72% in those treated with 60 Gy and neo-adjuvant CT However, this did not translate into a survival advantage., CONCLUSIONS: This study of CHARTWEL combined with induction chemotherapy, has shown that the strategy is feasible and that a possible therapeutic benefit may be obtained by the addition of CT. Although neo-adjuvant treatment increased acute mucosal reactions and slight-to-moderate pneumonitis seen with CHARTWEL 60 Gy, the clinical management and quality of life of these patients is similar to those treated with radiotherapy alone.",Excluded

Overall, 3D conformal treatment planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution to target tissues with lower hot spots and dose ranges. Dose homogeneity and guarantee of not under-dosing target tissues with 3D conformal planning came at the cost, however, of delivering greater mean doses of radiation and of irradiating greater volumes of surrounding normal tissue structures.

1026,"Transverse depth-dependent changes in corneal collagen lamellar orientation and distribution It is thought that corneal surface topography may be stabilized by the angular orientation of out-of plane lamellae that insert into the anterior limiting membrane. In this study, micro-focus X-ray scattering data were used to obtain quantitative information about lamellar inclination (with respect to the corneal surface) and the X-ray scatter intensity throughout the depth of the cornea from the centre to the temporal limbus. The average collagen inclination remained predominantly parallel to the tissue surface at all depths. However, in the central cornea, the spread of inclination angles was greatest in the anterior-most stroma (reflecting the increased lamellar interweaving in this region), and decreased with tissue depth; in the peripheral cornea inclination angles showed less variation throughout the tissue thickness. Inclination angles in the deeper stroma were generally higher in the peripheral cornea, suggesting the presence of more interweaving in the posterior stroma away from the central cornea. An increase in collagen X-ray scatter was identified in a region extending from the sclera anteriorly until about 2 mm from the corneal centre. This could arise from the presence of larger diameter fibrils, probably of scleral origin, which are known to exist in this region. Incorporation of this quantitative information into finite-element models will further improve the accuracy with which they can predict the biomechanical response of the cornea to pathology and refractive procedures.",Excluded
2667,"Coronary CT angiography performed by the novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation Objectives: To evaluate the image quality, coronary interpretability and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed with a newest generation of cardiac-CT scanner in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Background(s): Despite the relevant improvement in the CT temporal resolution that characterizes the last scanner generation, the evaluation of coronary arteries by CCTA in patients with AF remains the more challenging application of cardiac- CT, particularly in patients with heart rate (HR) >75 bpm. Moreover, the radiation exposure associated with CT is still very high in this clinical subset. Material(s) and Method(s): 49 patients (30 males, mean age 71,5+/-7,3 years old) with chronic AF undergoing CCTA for suspected CAD by using a novel whole organ volumetric high definition CT scanner (16cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows and 512 slices, gantry rotation time 0.28 sec), were enrolled in the study. Prospective ECG-triggering was used in all patients, of whom 20 with double-shot technique and the remaining 29 with single-shot technique. In all patients, image quality score (by a 4-point Likert scale on a per-segment level) and coronary interpretability were evaluated and the effective dose (ED) was recorded. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 87.7+/-22 bpm. The overall image quality was very high (Likert=3.4+/-1.2, excellent image quality=451 segments, good=206 segments, adequate=90 segments, poor/non diagnostic=19 segments). The overall coronary interpretability was 97.5% (747/766 segments); in patients performed with double-shot technique, the interpretability was 96.4%, whereas we found an interpretability of 98.4% with single-shot technique. The overall mean ED was 4.6+/-2.1 mSv, while a significantly lower dose (3.6+/-1.5 mSv) was measured for single-shot technique vs. double-shot approach (5.9+/-2.1 mSv, p<0.01). Conclusion(s): The novel whole organ high definition CT scanner allows to evaluate coronary arteries with high image quality and coronary interpretability and low radiation exposure in patients with atrial fibrillation and high HR during the scan.",Excluded
1143,"Can FRAX help portuguese men? The Portuguese model of the FRAX algorithm became available in June 2011. We reviewed the value of FRAX in a male population, to evaluate (1) if FRAX can identify patients with fracture risk (2) If it is relevant in patients without established risk factors. We reviewed all the DXA examinations in 2,5 years (1st July 2013 to 30th December 2015).A total of 6185 patients were examined with at least spine and femur analysis. During this period 395 examinations were done in men, of which 49 were excluded (7 which were incomplete and 42 patients who were on osteoporosis therapy). The study population consisted therefore of 346 examinations. Patients filled in a questionnaire. The technologist reviewed that data, inquired about fracture mechanisms and discussed risk factors with the patients. In many cases other relevant examinations (spine or hip x-ray, CT, MR) could be accessed on PACS. We had no laboratorial data. Previous fragility fractures were identified in 84 patients. For this study,FRAX values in patients with fractures were calculated ""without fracture"". We chose 10% as the threshold for the 10 year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (PMOF). The ratio of fractures increased slightly with age groups, except after 80y, and was very similar to osteoporosis diagnosed by DXA. Correlation with FRAX values was less reliable and FRAX identified much fewer cases. In patients without risk factors,FRAX didn't identify any patient with 10 year PMOF > 8%. The study population has several limitations: Its size is very small in comparison with studies with female patients, and it can suffer a selection bias. The poor performance of the FRAX threshold against DXAT-scores should be validated in a larger and prospective study. In the Portuguese male population even FRAX values computed with bone mineral density (BMD) data can sub evaluate fracture risk. FRAX values obtained without BMD should be interpreted with precaution. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
2380,"Effect of combined misonidazole and accelerated neon ions on a human melanoma transplanted into nude mice The response to accelerated neon ions of human Nall melanomas growing in nude mice was measured by an in vitro colony-forming assay following in situ tumor irradiation in the midposition of a 10-cm extended-peak ionization region. Values of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for peak neon ions compared with 60Co gamma radiation were 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, at the 1% and 10% survival levels. Following irradiation with peak neon ions, the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLD) was comparable to that observed after gamma irradiation. When misonidazole (1 mg/g intraperitoneal dose) was administered in combination with extended-peak neon ions, the drug enhancement ratio (ER) at the 1% survival level was 1.5 if the tumors were removed and plated in vitro immediately following irradiation, and 1.9 if tumor excision and plating were delayed for greater than 6 hours.

Method(s): Dosimetry estimates were calculated in subjects undergoing imaging studies to help define the radiation risk of [11C]-glucose PET imaging. Time-dependent radioactivity concentrations in normal tissues in 33 subjects after intravenous injection of [11C]-glucose were obtained by PET imaging. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated according to the procedures of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) committee along with the variation in dose based on the calculated standard deviation of activity distribution seen in the individual patients. Result(s): Total body exposure was a median of 3.0 muGy/MBq in men and 3.8 muGy/MBq in women. The effective dose equivalent was 3.8 muGy/MBq in men and 4.8 muGy/MBq in women. The critical organs were those that typically take up the most glucose (brain, heart wall and liver). Conclusion(s): The organ doses reported here are small and comparable to those associated with other commonly performed nuclear medicine tests and indicate that potential radiation risks associated with this radiotracer are within generally accepted limits.",Excluded
612,"Quantitative distribution of iodinated contrast media in body computed tomography: data from a large reference cohort Objectives: Dual-energy computed tomography allows for an accurate and reliable quantification of iodine. However, data on physiological distribution of iodine concentration (IC) is still sparse. This study aims to establish guidance for IC in abdominal organs and important anatomical landmarks using a large cohort of individuals without radiological tumor burden. Method(s): Five hundred seventy-one oncologic, portal venous phase dual-layer spectral detector CT studies of the chest and abdomen without tumor burden at time point of imaging confirmed by > 3-month follow-up were included. ROI were placed in parenchymatous organs (n = 25), lymph nodes (n = 6), and vessels (n = 3) with a minimum of two measurements per landmark. ROI were placed on conventional images and pasted to iodine maps to retrieve absolute IC. Normalization to the abdominal aorta was conducted to obtain iodine perfusion ratios. Bivariate regression analysis, t tests, and ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Absolute IC showed a broad scatter and varied with body mass index, between different age groups and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels (range 0.0 +/- 0.0 mg/ml-6.6 +/- 1.3 mg/ml). Unlike absolute IC, iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index; however, significant differences between the sexes and age groups persisted, showing a tendency towards decreased perfusion ratios in elderly patients (e.g., liver 18-44 years/>= 64 years: 0.50 +/- 0.11/0.43 +/- 0.10, p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): Distribution of IC obtained from a large-scale cohort is provided. As significant differences between sexes and age groups were found, this should be taken into account when obtaining quantitative iodine concentrations and applying iodine thresholds. Key Points: * Absolute iodine concentration showed a broad variation and differed between body mass index, age groups, and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels. * The iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index while significant differences between sexes and age groups persisted. * Provided guidance values may serve as reference when aiming to differentiate healthy and abnormal tissue based on iodine perfusion ratios.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
2217,"Abdominal radiographs understimate the prevalence of paget's disease of bone in a fifht of patients Background The most frequent skeletal localizations of Paget's disease of bone (PDB) are the pelvis, lumbar spine and proximal femur. Thus, an x-ray including these locations, such as an abdominal radiograph, allows the identification of the disease with a high probability. However, according to previous studies, only 60 to 90% of the global skeletal affection by PDB is included in the area of an abdominal radiograph [1]. In order toknow with certainty the real prevalence of PDB in any population, usually assessed by abdominal radiographs, we need to know the percentage of patients with PDB without pagetic affection of bones included in an abdominal x-ray. Objectives To estimate the percentage of PBD patients without skeletal affection in the pelvis, lumbar spine and/or proximal femur to assess the underestimation of the prevalence of PDB assessed by abdominal radiographs. Methods Transversal descriptive study based on medical records of 602 patients from the Spanish National PBD Register [2]. We included consecutive patients with a skeletal radionuclide scintigraphy and alkaline phosphatase measurement in the year of the diagnosis. We excluded patients treated with bisphosphonates or calcitonin in the previous five years. A central lecture of scintigraphies was made by expert rheumatologists, who identified the pagetic bones included in an abdominal radiograph and in the whole skeleton. Results 214 (36%) bone scans were analyzed. There were not significant differences (p>0.25) between the included patients and patients from the Register in age, gender and time from diagnosis. The percentage of patients with PDB in the lumbar spine, pelvis and/or proximal femur was 80% (IC 95%: [74%>85%]), without differences by gender. This implies that 1/5 of patients are not diagnosed of PDB if only abdominal x-rays are analyzed. New PDB prevalence estimation in Spain is 1.2% (0.9%>1.6%), being 1.5% (1%>2.1%) in men and 1% (0.7%>1.5%) in women. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients with pagetic involvement in each area. Conclusions Evaluation by abdominal x-rays underestimates 1/5 of patients with Paget's disease of bone. According to these data, the prevalence of this disease in Spain is 1.2%.

531,"Extramedullary plasmacytoma: Clinical and histopathologic study Purpose: To review the histories of extramedullary plasmacytoma patients diagnosed in Slovenia between 1969 and 1999, to determine the relationship between radiotherapy (XRT) dose and local tumor control, and to clarify the role of elective nodal XRT and the prognostic value of Bartl's histologic grading criteria (originally devised for multiple myeloma [MM]). Methods and Materials: The database of the Cancer Registry of Slovenia was used for the identification of patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: bone marrow biopsy showing less than 10% plasma cells, normal skeletal survey, and immunohistochemically determined tumor monoclonality. Simulation/portal films were reviewed to assess the extent of elective nodal XRT. Result(s): Twenty-six patients with 31 tumors fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In 4 patients, nine metachronously appearing solitary tumors were diagnosed. The head-and-neck region and other body sites were the sites of origin of primary tumors in 84% and 16% of patients, respectively, whereas in the two regions, regional disease was seen in 15% and 60% of patients, respectively. Therapy was as follows: XRT, 12 patients; surgery and postoperative XRT, 15 patients; and surgery, 4 patients. Ultimate local and regional control rates were 90% and 97%, respectively, and MM developed in 2 (8%) patients. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates were 87% and 61%, respectively. The analysis of the dose-effect relationship showed that more conservative treatment is justified: for macroscopic disease, 40-50 Gy (2 Gy/day), adjusted to the bulk of disease; for microscopic disease, 36-40 Gy; after R0 surgery, no XRT is required, but close observation is needed. No attempts should be made to treat uninvolved nodal regions. Using Bartl's histologic grading criteria, trends were detected in patients with higher tumor grades: regional lymph node involvement (p = 0.04) and shorter disease-specific survival (p = 0.08). Conclusion(s): Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a highly curable disease when XRT is used with or without previous surgery. The rate of conversion to MM is low. Moderate-dose XRT using limited fields is recommended. The prognostic value of Bartl's grading system needs further evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
837,"Radiation metabolomics. 5. Identification of urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in nonhuman primates by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has previously demonstrated utility for identifying biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in cellular, mouse and rat in vivo radiation models. To provide a valuable link from small laboratory rodents to humans, gamma-radiation-induced urinary biomarkers were investigated using a nonhuman primate total-body-irradiation model. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches were applied to determine whether biomarkers could be identified, as well as the previously discovered rodent biomarkers of gamma radiation. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a time course of clean-catch urine samples collected from nonhuman primates (n = 6 per cohort) exposed to sham, 1.0, 3.5, 6.5 or 8.5 Gy doses of (60)Co gamma ray (~0.55 Gy/min) ionizing radiation. By multivariate data analysis, 13 biomarkers of radiation were discovered: N-acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, taurine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, tyrosol sulfate, 3-hydroxytyrosol sulfate, tyramine sulfate, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, and adipic acid. N-Acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, and taurine had previously been identified in rats, and taurine and xanthine in mice after ionizing radiation exposure. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has thus successfully revealed and verified urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in the nonhuman primate for the first time, which indicates possible mechanisms for ionizing radiation injury.",Included

Eighty-nine patients underwent hepatic dynamic CT using one of the 2 protocols: tube voltage of 120 kVp, contrast dose of 600 mgI/kg, and filtered back projection in Protocol A (n = 46), and tube voltage of 100 kVp, contrast dose of 500 mgI/kg, and AIDR 3D in Protocol B (n = 43). The volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) were compared between the 2 groups. Objective image noise and tumor to liver contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were also compared. Three radiologists independently reviewed image quality. The jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis was performed to compare diagnostic performance. The mean CTDIvol and SSDE of Protocol B (14.3 and 20.2, respectively) were significantly lower than those of Protocol A (22.1 and 31.4, P < .001). There were no significant differences in either objective image noise or CNR.

The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space. Unfortunately, during the MDS mission, one PTN-Tg and two Wt mice died due to health status or payload-related reasons. The remaining mice showed a normal behavior throughout the experiment and appeared in excellent health conditions at landing. During the experiment, the mice health conditions and their water and food consumption were daily checked. Upon landing mice were sacrificed, blood parameters measured and tissues dissected for subsequent analysis. To obtain as much information as possible on microgravity-induced tissue modifications, we organized a Tissue Sharing Program: 20 research groups from 6 countries participated. In order to distinguish between possible effects of the MDS housing conditions and effects due to the near-zero gravity environment, a ground replica of the flight experiment was performed at the University of Genova.

1402,"MiR-19 in blood plasma reflects lung cancer occurrence but is not specifically associated with radon exposure Radon is one of the most powerful carcinogens, particularly in terms of lung cancer onset and development. miRNAs may be considered not only as markers of the ongoing tumorigenesis but also as a hallmark of exposure to radiation, including radon and its progeny. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to estimate the value of plasma miR-19b-3p level as the prospective marker of the response to radon exposure in lung cancer pathogenesis. A total of 136 subjects were examined, including 49 radon-exposed patients with lung cancer, 37 patients with lung cancer without radon exposure and 50 age/sex matched healthy controls. Total RNA from blood samples was extracted and used to detect miR-19b-3p expression via reverse transcription quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. The 2-DELTADELTACq method was used to quantify the amount of relative miRNA. The plasma level of p53 protein was determined using a Human p53 ELISA kit. Plasma miR-19b-3p level was significantly higher in the patients with lung cancer groups, compared with the healthy control group (P<0.0001). No other statistically significant differences were determined in the expression level of plasma miR-19b-3p between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed to radon and not exposed to radon. The expression level of free circulating miR-19b-3p was higher in the group of non-smoking patients with lung cancer, compared with smokers with lung cancer. The miR-19b-3p was 1.4-fold higher in non-smokers than in smokers (P<0.05). No association between plasma levels of p53 protein and miR-19b-3p freely circulating in patients with lung cancer was observed. No other statistically significant differences were determined in the plasma p53 protein level between patients diagnosed with lung cancer exposed and not exposed to radon. These results indicated that detection of miR-19b-3p levels in plasma potentially could be exploited as a noninvasive method for the lung cancer diagnostics. However, this miRNA is not suitable as the precise marker for radon impact.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
1245,"Outcome in a prospective phase II trial of medically inoperable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy Purpose: The impact of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) on 3-year progression-free survival of medically inoperable patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was analyzed in a prospective phase II study. Patients and Methods: Fifty-seven patients with T1NOMO (70%) and T2N0M0 (30%) were included between August 2003 and September 2005 at seven different centers in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and observed up to 36 months. SBRT was delivered with 15 Gy times three at the 67% isodose of the planning target volume. Result(s): Progression-free survival at 3 years was 52%. Overall- and cancer-specific survival at 1, 2, and 3 years was 86%, 65%, 60%, and 93%, 88%, 88%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between patients with T1 or T2 tumors. At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 4 to 47 months), 27 patients (47%) were deceased, seven as a result of lung cancer and 20 as a result of concurrent disease. Kaplan-Meier estimated local control at 3 years was 92%. Local relapse was observed in four patients (7%). Regional relapse was observed in three patients (5%). Nine patients (16%) developed distant metastases. The estimated risk of all failure (local, regional, or distant metastases) was increased in patients with T2 (41%) compared with those with T1 (18%) tumors (P = .027).

METHOD(S): The experimental animals were whole-body exposed to microwave radiation with frequency of 2,450 MHz, power density of 1, 5, 15 mW/cm(2) respectively 1 h everyday for 30 days. Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05). The percentages of G(2) + M phase thymocytes in both radiation groups (12.24% +/- 1.82%, 11.19% +/- 1.36%) were lower than that in control group (14.58% +/- 0.64%) (P < 0.01). Thymocytic apoptosis rates in the three experimental groups (7.18% +/- 0.99%, 10.06% +/- 1.58%, 9.45% +/- 0.92%) were higher than that in control (4.25% +/- 1.63%) (P < 0.01), but the evident difference between 5 mW/cm(2) and 15 mW/cm(2) was not found (P > 0.05).

F344 rats were exposed to 239PuO22 to achieve an initial lung burden of 0.5 kBq and then exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/week to cigarette smoke at 100 or 250 mg particulate matter/m3 for up to 30 months. Exposure to cigarette smoke increased the cumulative radiation dose to lung by slowing the clearance of 239PuO2. 239PuO2 alone did not affect survival, but the higher cigarette smoke exposure shortened survival in females. Combined exposure to 239PuO2 and cigarette smoke acted synergistically to shorten survival in both genders. The combined effects of cigarette smoke and 239PuO2 were approximately additive for lung hyperplasia and adenomas but were strongly synergistic for carcinomas. Differences between observed incidences and incidences predicted by survival-adjusted models accounting for increased radiation dose revealed a substantial component of synergy for carcinomas above that attributable to the radiation dose effect. The synergy for malignant lung tumors is consistent with findings from uranium miners and nuclear weapons production workers. These results bolster confidence in the epidemiological findings and have implications for risk assessment. © 2010 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
2460,"Delayed non-myeloablative irradiation after lung transplantation to induce allograft acceptance in a large animal model Purpose: Previously, we induced long term tolerance in animals that underwent perioperative irradiation and a donor-specific alloantigen infusion in our miniature swine lung transplantation model. Here, we delayed induction to improve its clinical applicability. Method(s): Left sided single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched male donors was performed in 11 female outbred minipigs. Group 1 (n= 5) received non-myeloablative irradiation (7 Gy thymus and 1,5 Gy whole body, IRR) 12 hours before transplantation and perioperative donor-specific splenocyte infusion (SpTx). Group 2 (n= 3) also received a perioperative SpTx, but underwent delayed irradiation 3 days after transplantation. Group 3 (n= 3) was also exposed to delayed IRR but did not receive a donor-specific SpTx. Immunosuppression was maintained for 28 days with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Peripheral blood chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): In group 1, three animals never rejected their grafts until elective sacrifice at postoperative days (POD) 800+, the other two showed rejection on POD 239 and 360. In group 2, median allograft survival was 92 days. Out of the third group, one animal showed rejection on POD 226, the other two are currently alive at POD 216 and 393. In all groups, chimerism was detectable 1 hour after reperfusion of the lung, and peaked 1 hour after SpTx in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 showed early leukocyte chimerism levels of up to 30%. Analysis of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells revealed a rising tendency in group 1, whereas groups 2 and 3 had decreasing levels of this T cell subpopulation after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Conclusion(s): Preoperative irradiation and perioperative SpTx had the potential to upregulate the frequency of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells. SpTx without preceding IRR seemed to rather upregulate the effector arm, than inducing Treg proliferation. Delayed IRR only may lead to prolonged allograft survival in all three animals. This unresponsiveness might be due to induced anergy.",Excluded

After surgery the persistence of lymph node metastases in our series of patients was frequent (30%). Such patients are preferentially treated with radioiodine and shifted to surgical reintervention when the nodal lesions persist after two 131I treatments.

150,"Estimation of activity of administered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose by measurement of the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is now a routine procedure for the management of cancer patients. Intravenous administration of FDG is sometimes halted due to troubles. In such cases, estimations of the FDG dosage injected prior to halting administration may be helpful. We have established a method of estimating the activity of FDG to patients on the basis of the dose equivalent rate on the surface of the right temporal region of the head. The correlation of actual administered dosage with independent variables, such as the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head, age, sex, and body weight, was analyzed using multiple regression analysis to obtain linear, quadratic, and cubic regression equations. Result(s): When entering independent variables, the cubic regression equation could be used to estimate an administered dosage with an accuracy of +/-10 % for 62 % of all patients and +/-20 % for 90 % of all patients. Conclusion(s): We conclude that this method is useful for estimating the administered dosage from the dose equivalent rate on the temporal region of the head.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
1743,"320-row coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with automatic exposure control (AEC): effect of 100 kV versus 120 kV on image quality and dose exposure PURPOSE: To compare the impact of a 100 kV tube voltage protocol to 120 kV in terms of image quality and radiation dose by a 320 row coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with automatic exposure control (AEC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a propensity matched analysis we compared a group of 135 patients scanned using a 100 kV tube voltage protocol with a group of 135 subjects scanned employing a 120 kV tube voltage setting. In all subjects the heart rate (HR) was <65 bpm and all CT scans were acquired using a prospective ECG gating and AEC strategy. Mean effective radiation dose and subjective and objective (Noise or N, signal to noise ratio or SNR, contrast to noise ratio or CNR) image quality, were evaluated. Subjective quality was assessed by two experienced radiologists using a 5-point scale (0: non diagnostic-4: excellent) using the 15-segment American Heart Association (AHA) coronary artery classification., RESULTS: Mean effective dose and noise were non significantly different between the two groups: mean effective dose was 2.89 +/- 0.7 mSv in the 100 kV group and 2.80 +/- 0.57 mSv in the 120 kV group (p = 0.25) while noise was 28.9 +/- 3.3 in the 120 kV group and 29.05 +/- 3.6 in the 100 kV group (p = 0.72). Both SNR and CNR were significantly higher in the 100 kV group than in the 120 kV group. This data agrees with the evidence that subjective quality was significantly higher in the 100 kV group in the middle and distal segmental classes., CONCLUSION: Our study shows that, in using a 320 row CCTA with AEC strategy it is better to employ a 100 kV tube voltage protocol because compared to 120 kV tube voltage setting, it appears to significantly improve both subjective and objective image quality without decreasing the mean effective radiation dose.",Excluded
2036,"Expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice The aim is to clarify expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice. A mouse model of gamma-ray induced leukemia was produced, and by means of quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the expression of mRNA and protein, phosphorylation level, and protein activity of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells were investigated in these mice. The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.",Included

The median DLP (703.5 mGy . cm, range 390-2203 mGy . cm) was 7.9% lower when using the algorithm compared with the standard 120 kV protocol (median 756 mGy . cm, range 345-2267 mGy . cm). A reduction in potential to 100 kV occurred in 32 cases; therefore, these patients received significantly lower radiation exposure compared with the 120 kV protocol., CONCLUSION: Automated attenuation-based tube potential selection produces good diagnostic image quality in chest-abdomen-pelvis CT and reduces the patient's overall radiation dose by 7.9% compared to the standard 120 kV protocol.",Excluded
2826,"Esophagectomy for locally advanced esophageal cancer, followed by chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy Aim: To compare the efficacy and toxicity of a three-step combination therapy with post-operative radiation alone for locally advanced esophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with T3-4 and N0-1 esophageal carcinoma from a number of institutions were non-randomly, prospectively enrolled in the study. All patients underwent single-stage curative en bloc esophagectomy. The patients were then assigned into one of two treatment groups based on treatment consisting of either post-operative concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 followed by systemic adjuvant chemotherapy (four monthly cycles of cisplatin 20 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 1 000 mg/m2 for five consecutive days), or, post-operative radiation alone. The radiotherapy dose was 55-60 Gy for all patients. Primary end-point of this study was to assess the per-protocol patients' improvement of overall survival benefit. Secondary end-point was designed to evaluate both the per-protocol and intent-to-treat patients' outcome of survival. Result(s): A total of 60 patients (n = 30 per group) were enrolled in this study. The two groups were generally comparable for demographic characteristics and hematological and non-hematological toxicities. The CCRT with weekly cisplatin was well tolerated, with significantly better overall survival (30.9 mo vs 20.7 mo; 95% CI, 27.5-36.4 vs 15.2-26.1) and 3-year survival (70.0% vs 33.7%; P = 0.003). Low histological grade of tumor (P<0.001) was associated with favorable survival in these locally advanced patients. Conclusion(s): For locally advanced esophageal cancer, the combination of esophagectomy, post-operative CCRT with weekly cisplatin and systemic adjuvant chemotherapy is well tolerated and effective. A large-scale, prospective randomized trial of this regimen is in progress. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
127,"Cerebrovascular diseases in nuclear workers first employed at the Mayak PA in 1948-1972 Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) (430-438 ICD-9 codes) have been studied in a cohort of 18,763 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of the workers were exposed to external gamma-rays only while others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation due to incorporated (239)Pu. After adjusting for non-radiation factors, there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence with total absorbed dose from external gamma-rays and total absorbed dose to liver from internal alpha radiation. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.20 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses; the data were consistent with a linear trend in risk with external dose. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-radiation doses to liver from incorporated (239)Pu greater than 0.025 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. There was no statistically significant trend in CVD mortality risk with either external gamma-ray dose or internal alpha-radiation dose to liver. The risk estimates obtained are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Further studies of the unique cohort of Mayak workers chronically exposed to external and internal radiation will allow improving the reliability and validating the radiation safety standards for occupational and public exposure.",Included
3243,"Tape stripping the stratum corneum for biomarkers of ultraviolet radiation exposure at sub-erythemal dosages: a study in human volunteers PURPOSE: Prevalence of skin cancer is rapidly increasing. There is a need for non-invasive biomarkers to assess efficacy of prevention strategies aiming at reduction of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Recently, stratum corneum (SC) biomarkers were applied in various inflammatory skin diseases. Here, we explore their suitability as candidate biomarkers for UVR., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve volunteers were exposed to a UVB-dose of 0.72 SED, three times a week, during three weeks. As candidate biomarkers, cis-isomers of urocanic acid (cUCA) and 25 immunological mediators were measured in the SC., RESULTS: Eight immunological markers significantly changed from baseline. Of them, IL-1RA/IL-1alpha and a placental growth factor (PIGF) showed gradual changes during UVR-exposure (p < 0.01 for linear trend). cUCA increased sharply already after the first exposure, however, reached a plateau in the second week., CONCLUSIONS: SC represents a promising, non-invasive alternative to skin biopsy in detecting UVR-induced changes. cUCA is the marker of choice for assessment of single UVR-exposure; however, it is less suitable for cumulative UVR-dose. Immunological markers including IL-1RA/IL-1alpha and PIGF showed gradual changes, and therefore are convenient for monitoring chronic UVR-exposure. These candidate biomarkers might facilitate assessment of the efficacy of preventive measures in the workplace and general population.",Excluded
270,"Automated synthesis and dosimetry of 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF): A radiotracer for imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer 6-Deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF) is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging GLUT5 in breast cancer. The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded
1986,"Management and long-term outcomes of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma: Twenty-year experience at a single institution Purpose/Objective(s): Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare malignancy of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses generally associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor long-term survival. Optimal management is not well-defined, and varying combinations of surgery (S), radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) have been reported. There have been substantial advances in surgery as well as radiation therapy, which may offer improved outcomes. We review the management approaches, long-term outcomes, and patterns of failure of patients treated at our institution to help define the optimal management for this rare malignancy. Materials/Methods: Fifteen patients with SNUC were treated from 1992- 2012 at our institution, with pathology reviewed and confirmed. Demographic, treatment, and clinical data were collected from medical records. Patients underwent imaging evaluation with CT and/or MRI. Event outcomes were calculated from date of surgery to time of recurrence, death, or last follow-up. Survival statistics were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier and Cox Regression methods. Result(s): There were 10 male and 5 female patients with median age 49 years (range 22-82). Most patients had locally advanced T stage: T2 (n = 2), T3 (n = 5), and T4 (n = 8). At diagnosis, 1 patient was clinically node positive and none had distant metastases. Treatment was as follows: 4 S + postoperative RT +/- chemotherapy (CT); 3 preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) + S; 7 primary CRT; 1 RT alone. Nine had RT to primary site alone, and 6 had elective neck RT. Median dose was 69.5 Gy (range 50.4-70.2). Most received concurrent CT (n = 12). Median follow up was 39 months (range 3-206). At time of analysis, 8 patients are alive, 6 have died and 1 is lost to follow up. KM projected 5-year OS and RFS-rates were 70% and 53%, respectively. Five patients recurred: 1 local, 1 local/neck, 1 neck, 1 distant, 1 local/neck/distant. Median time to recurrence was 7 months. On univariate analysis, there was no statistically significant impact of stage, use of surgery, use of chemotherapy, radiation dose, gender, or age on survival. A trend for improved survival with concurrent CRT was seen (p = 0.097). Conclusion(s): SNUC is a highly aggressive malignancy associated with a high risk of disease recurrence, consistent with other series reported in the literature. There are some long term survivors who were treated with primary CRT or preoperative CRT followed by surgery. Early multimodality therapy is necessary for improved outcomes. The optimal timing and sequence of S, RT and CT should be further investigated.",Excluded
1899,"Validation of NRG oncology/RTOG-0129 risk groups for HPV-positive and HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer: Implications for risk-based therapeutic intensity trials Background: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-0129 recursive partitioning analysis was the basis for risk-based therapeutic intensification trials for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). To the authors' knowledge, the question of whether RTOG-0129 overall survival (OS) estimates for low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups are similar in other data sets or applicable to progression-free survival (PFS) is unknown. Therefore, the authors evaluated whether survival differences between RTOG-0129 risk groups persist at 5 years, are reproducible in an independent clinical trial, and are applicable to PFS, and whether toxicities differ across risk groups. Method(s): Prospective randomized clinical trials were analyzed retrospectively. RTOG-0129 evaluated standard versus accelerated fractionation radiotherapy concurrent with cisplatin. RTOG-0522 compared the combination of cisplatin and accelerated fractionation with or without cetuximab. Patients with OPC with available p16 status and tobacco history were eligible. Result(s): There was a total of 260 patients and 287 patients, respectively, from RTOG-0129 and RTOG-0522, with median follow-ups for surviving patients of 7.9 years (range, 1.7-9.9 years) and 4.7 years (range, 0.1-7.0 years), respectively. Previous OS differences in RTOG-0129 persisted at 5 years. In RTOG-0522, the 5-year OS rates for the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 88.1%, 69.9%, and 45.1%, respectively (P for trend, <.001). The 5-year PFS rates for the same 3 groups were 72.9%, 56.1%, and 42.2%, respectively. In RTOG-0522 among a subgroup of patients considered to be at very good risk (p16-positive disease, smoking history of <=10 pack-years, and classified with T1-T2 disease with ipsilateral lymph nodes measuring <=6 cm or T3 disease without contralateral or >6 cm lymph nodes), the 5-year OS and PFS rates were 93.8% and 82.2%, respectively. Overall rates of acute and late toxicities were similar by risk group. Conclusion(s): RTOG-0129 risk groups persisted at 5 years and were reproducible in RTOG-0522. However, there was variability in the estimates. These data underscore the importance of long-term follow-up and appropriate patient selection in therapeutic deintensification trials.Copyright © 2019 American Cancer Society",Excluded

Patients and Methods: A total of 222 prospectively analyzed patients with various HN malignancies were treated with conventional and intensity-modulated RT. Stimulated individual parotid gland flow rates were measured before RT and 1 year after RT using Lashley cups at both centers. A flow ratio <25% of pretreatment was defined as a complication. The data were fitted to the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman model. Result(s): A total of 384 parotid glands (Michigan: 157; Utrecht: 227 glands) was available for analysis 1 year after RT. Combined NTCP analysis based on mean dose resulted in a TD50 (uniform dose leading to 50% complication probability) of 39.9 Gy and m (steepness of the curve) of 0.40. The resulting NTCP curve had good qualitative agreement with the combined clinical data. Mean doses of 25-30 Gy were associated with 17-26% NTCP. Conclusion(s): A definite NTCP curve for parotid gland function 1 year after RT is presented, based on mean dose. No threshold dose was observed, and TD50 was equal to 40 Gy.

375,"LED photoprevention: reduced MED response following multiple LED exposures BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As photoprotection with traditional sunscreen presents some limitations, the use of non-traditional treatments to increase skin resistance to ultraviolet (UV) induced damage would prove particularly appealing. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the potential of non-thermal pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) treatments (660 nm) prior to UV exposure in the induction of a state of cellular resistance against UV-induced erythema., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects and two patients with polymorphous light eruption (PLE) were exposed to 5, 6, or 10 LED treatments (660 nm) on an EXPERIMENTAL anterior thigh region. Individual baseline minimal erythema doses (MED) were then determined. UV radiation was thereafter performed on the LED EXPERIMENTAL and CONTROL anterior thigh areas. Finally, 24 hours post-UV irradiation, LED pre-treated MED responses were compared to the non-treated sites., RESULTS: Reduction of erythema was considered significant when erythema was reduced by >50% on the LED-treated side as opposed to CONTROL side. A significant LED treatment reduction in UV-B induced erythema reaction was observed in at least one occasion in 85% of subjects, including patients suffering from PLE. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-related pattern in results. Finally, a sun protection factor SPF-15-like effect and a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were observed on the LED pre-treated side., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that LED based therapy prior to UV exposure provided significant protection against UV-B induced erythema. The induction of cellular resistance to UV insults may possibly be explained by the induction of a state a natural resistance to the skin via specific cell signaling pathways and without the drawbacks and limitations of traditional sunscreens. These results represent an encouraging step towards expanding the potential applications of LED therapy and could be useful in the treatment of patients with anomalous reactions to sunlight.",Excluded
207,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

1080,"Predictors and clinical significance of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcoma Background. Limb salvage surgery (LSS) has gained widespread acceptance as the current treatment for treating extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and has been greatly refined since its inception. Combined with improved adjuvant treatment modalities, rates of local relapse have greatly decreased. Nonetheless, local recurrence still occurs and identifying the cause and the subsequent effects of local recurrence can provide valuable insights as LSS continues to evolve. Methods. This retrospective study evaluated 278 patients treated for STS of the extremities between 2000 and 2006. Of these, 41 patients developed a local recurrence while 247 did not. Tumor characteristics and prognostic outcomes were analyzed. Wilcoxon rank sum test and either chi or Fisher's exact was used to compare variables. Kaplan Meier and Gray's test for cumulative risk were also performed. Results. Patients who had a positive margin were 3.76 times more likely to develop local recurrence when compared to those with negative margins. This corresponds to a 38% risk of local recurrence if the margins were positive after six years vs. 12% if the margins were negative. In patients who underwent a re-excision, the presence or absence of residual disease upon re-excision did not have any bearing on local recurrence (p =0.27). In comparing patients with and without local recurrence, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate and the proportion encountering distant metastasis and death due to sarcoma (p >0.05). Conclusions. Despite advancements in surgery, radiation and imaging, positive margins still occur, and the presence of positive margins following definitive treatment continues to remain as a strong predictor for local recurrence. While local recurrence represents a negative outcome for a patient, its impact on future prognosis is influenced by a variety of factors such as time to local recurrence as well as the tumor's inherent biological characteristics. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
1299,"Monochromatic excimer light (308 nm): an immunohistochemical study of cutaneous T cells and apoptosis-related molecules in psoriasis BACKGROUND: Various types of UVB radiation source (290-320 nm) are used in treating psoriasis and their therapeutic mechanism has been attributed to immunosuppressive properties. Recently, a new UVB source generated by a 308-nm excimer laser has been introduced for the treatment of psoriasis., OBJECTIVE: In this study we investigated the immunohistochemical evaluation of T cells and the expression of various apoptosis-related molecules in the psoriatic hyperproliferative skin before and after treatment with 308-nm monochromatic excimer light (MEL)., METHODS: Ten patients (three women and seven men), ranging in age from 29 to 79 years, affected by plaque-type psoriasis vulgaris, were treated with MEL. Biopsies from psoriatic lesions of MEL-treated sites were taken before, 24 h and/or 48 h after the first irradiation and analysed by the immunophosphatase alkaline technique (APAAP)., RESULTS: MEL treatment was found to cause a significant decrease in the rate of proliferation of keratinocytes and a relevant depletion of T cells in all psoriatic lesions, 48 h after the first irradiation: 308 nm light eliminated T cells from the psoriatic epidermis and also from the dermis, highlighting the ability of this UVB source to penetrate the skin compared with normal UVB and establish direct cytotoxic action on T cells infiltrating skin lesions. Rapid clearing of psoriatic lesions involves potential molecular targets of UVB in T cells including p53, which is upregulated after direct irradiation with 308-nm UVB. Moreover, Bcl-2 expression in healing psoriasis epidermis after MEL treatment is significantly decreased compared with untreated skin and the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling) technique revealed the presence of relevant apoptotic keratinocytes in the irradiated epidermis., CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that psoriatic skin after monochromatic excimer light therapy is associated with significant T-cell depletion and alterations of apoptosis-related molecules accompanied by a decreased proliferation index and clinical remission.",Excluded

2265,"Incidence of pain flare following palliative radiation therapy for symptomatic bone metastases: Multicenter prospective observational study Purpose/Objective(s): Palliative radiation therapy (RT) is a wellestablished treatment option for symptomatic bone metastases, with few treatment-related side effects. However, pain flare, a temporary worsening of bone pain in the irradiated metastatic site, has been recognized following RT. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of pain flare following RT for painful bone metastases. Materials/Methods: Patients with bone metastases treated with RT were eligible. Worst pain scores and analgesic consumption were collected before, daily during, and for 10 days after treatment. Pain flare was defined as a 2-point increase in the worst pain score (0-10) compared to baseline with no decrease in analgesic intake, or a 25% increase in analgesic intake with no decrease in worst pain score. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was administered to measure the ""sensory"" dimension of pain (intensity, or severity) and its ""reactive"" dimension (interference with daily function) before the RT treatment and at the 4-weeks follow-up evaluation. Descriptive statistics were reported. Response rate and 95% confidence intervals were calculated at 4 weeks after RT. A comparison of patients with pain flare vs those without was performed. The relationships between the occurrence of pain flare and collected demographic variables were investigated. Result(s): From June 2010 to December 2013, 160 patients were enrolled in this study. From this cohort, 94 patients with complete data were evaluable for pain flare. There were 61 (65%) men and 33 (35%) women. Median age was 66 years. The majority of patients had primary breast (12%), lung (31%), or prostate (22%) carcinoma and were treated with 8 Gy in a single fraction (28%) or 20 Gy in five fractions (65%). The overall pain flare incidence across all centers was 42/94 (44.7%). The majority of pain flares occurred on Days 1-5 (88%) as opposed to Days 6-10 (12%). The median duration of the pain flare was 2 days. There was no significant difference between patients who experienced a pain flare vs those who did not in terms of sex, age, primary cancer site, radiation dose, previous systemic therapy, location or area of RT, or on any of the BPI items (p > 0.05). BPI scores showed a significant improvement at 4 weeks on all functional interference items (p < 0.05). The main differences were seen in the ""worst pain"" and ""sleep"" domains, both decreased from 7/10 at baseline to 4/10 at the 4-week follow-up. Conclusion(s): Pain flare is a common event, occurring in nearly half of the patients that receive palliative RT for symptomatic bone metastases. Furthermore, RT for symptomatic bone metastases is a very effective palliative treatment, in terms of both pain control and functional interference.",Excluded
474,"Functional MR urography for assessment of obstructive and reflux uropathies Purpose - Objective. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU. The CHOP-fMRU examination protocol is very robust and reliable and able to give as much information as MAG3 scintigraphy. It is now possible to receive information on morphology, excretion, and split renal function with one examination.",Excluded
1323,"Kypho-IORT: Intraoperative radiotherapy in spinal metastases: Nine-month clinical results BACKGROUND CONTEXT: A new technique of combined kyphoplasty and intraoperative radiation therapy (Kypho-IORT) was introduced in 2010 [1]. The indication, rationale and possible advantages have been published in 2011 [2]. In the first clinical period several technical improvements and modifications could stabilize the method, its clinical feasibility and shortterm safety has been shown [3]. Due to the higher local radiation doses compared to extracorporal radiotherapy (EBRT) permitted by the steep dose fall off of the IORT-source a higher local tumor control can potentially be achieved by Kypho-IORT. In this study we present an intermediate prospective follow-up of 9-month after Kypho-IORT. PURPOSE: Local tumor control and clinical use of Kypho-IORT. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Evidence level IV: prospective case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: 62 patients suffering from 77 spinal metastases which were treated with Kypho-IORT were included in the prospective study. Data of 16 patients who finished the 4th follow-up appointment after around 9 months and were interpreted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Acquired basic data were gender, age at surgery, tumor entity, treated vertebral level, delivered dose. Prospective collected data were pain measure by visual analogue scale (VAS) preoperative and at follow-up, Karnofsky Index, local metastasis control in the treated vertebra and general progression of metastases by CT or MRI. METHOD(S): Clinical and radiographic follow-up examinations. RESULT(S): 16 patients (12 females, 4 males) with an average age of 61 years were included. Twelve patients had breast cancer, two patients suffered prostate cancer and one each with lung, ovarian and sigmoid cancer. Thirteen thoracic and 4 lumbar vertebrae were treated with an average surgical time of 70 minutes per vertebra. The time from surgery to the 9-month follow-up was in average 348 days. The Karnofsky index was constant with 87 preoperative versus 86 at follow-up. The VAS average decreased from 4.1 preoperative to 1.4 postoperative and 0.8 at follow-up. In all cases but two, a dose of 8gy in a radius of 5mm was delivered successfully, two cases with second dose level at 8gy in 8mm distance to isocenter. Three patients had a local progress, one patient due to incorrect indication. Two vertebrae needed open revision surgery; one local progress was treated only with EBRT. Eight patients showed a general tumor progress. CONCLUSION(S): Kypho-IORT can offer a fast postoperative pain reduction, immediate stabilization and prevention of secondary fractures in the treated vertebrae by kyphoplasty which could be confirmed in this small cohort. The VAS decreased postoperative and this level was maintained during follow-up. Local tumor control (indication failures ignored) by intraoperative radiation could be achieved in 87% of the vertebrae over the 9 months period, which seems to be better than single fraction radiation schedules and at least comparable to multiple fraction schedules of conventional radiation. Furthermore the Karnofsky-Index stayed constant over the follow-up period which proves the low morbidity of the intervention in short and in intermediate term. All 14 of 16 patients of the 9-month-follow- up were treated with the lowest calculated treatment dose; probably an even higher local tumor control is achievable by higher local radiation doses.These results warrant further evaluation of this technique by a dose escalation and a multicenter study, which is currently under way.",Excluded
3081,"Effect of flowable thrombin-containing collagen-based hemostatic matrix for preventing pancreatic fistula after pancreatectomy: A randomized clinical trial Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a flowable hemostatic matrix, and their effects for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreatectomy. Method(s): This was a randomized, clinical, single-center, single-blind (participant), non-inferiority, phase IV, and parallel-group trial. The primary endpoint was the incidence of POPF. The secondary endpoints were risk factors for POPF, drain removal days, incidence of complication, 90-day mortality, and length of hospital stay. Result(s): This study evaluated a total of 53 patients, of whom 26 patients were in the intervention group (flowable hemostatic matrix) and 27 patients were in the control group (thrombin-coated collagen patch). POPF was more common in the control group than in the intervention group (59.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.037). Among participants who underwent distal pancreatectomy, POPF (33.3% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.004), and clinically relevant POPF (8.3% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.027) was more common in the control group. A multivariate logistic regression model identified flowable hemostatic matrix use as an independent negative risk factor for POPF, especially in cases of distal pancreatectomy (DP) (odds ratio 17.379, 95% confidential interval 1.453-207.870, p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Flowable hemostatic matrix application is a simple, feasible, and effective method of preventing POPF after pancreatectomy, especially for patients with DP. Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the efficacy of preventing POPF in the intervention group compared to the control group.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

426,"Nasal mucociliary clearance after radiation therapy Irradiation has been demonstrated to cause decreased mucociliary clearance in animal models. We sought to verify this effect clinically by using the saccharin transport test to evaluate nasal mucociliary clearance in 9 patients previously treated with radiation therapy to the nasal cavity. The patients also completed a questionnaire examining the prevalence of nasal symptoms before and after radiation therapy. Patients who received radiation therapy had no clearance of saccharin from the nasal cavity at a minimum of 20 minutes. The controls had a median clearance time of 5 minutes. The patients noted a higher prevalence of nasal congestion, drainage, and facial pain after radiation therapy. This study demonstrates that radiation therapy to the nasal cavity causes a decrease in nasal mucociliary clearance. This alteration should be considered when selecting therapy for malignancies in the nasal area.",Excluded
2313,"Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (70 Gy): Equivalent or superior to 60 or 74 Gy of RTOG 0617? Purpose/Objective(s): RTOG 0617 demonstrated inferior outcomes with 74 Gy of concurrent radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) compared to 60 Gy, though the findings are controversial. We hypothesized that an intermediate RT dose might reach equipoise and improve outcomes versus 60 Gy or 74 Gy. This retrospective single institution analysis analyzed patients treated uniformly with 70 Gy/concurrent CT. Materials/Methods: Records from 216 consecutive patients with Stage III NSCLC treated from 2000 to 2015 with concurrent CTand RT (70 Gy) were reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor/treatment details and outcomes were abstracted. Local failure (LF), regional failure (RF), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier univariate (UVA) and Cox-regression multivariate (MVA) analyses. Predictors of toxicity were evaluated by Pearson Chi-Square. Result(s): Median follow-up was 18 months. Median age was 63 years; 53% were female. Histology: adenocarcinoma (49%), squamous cell carcinoma (32%), other (19%). Patients were mostly stage IIIB (50.4%), T3/T4 (53.7%), N2 (64%) and N3 (28%), and were ECOG 0 (33%), 1 (56%), and 2 (11%) at diagnosis. CT included platinum doublets (94%), weekly (52%), induction (12%) and consolidative (22%) therapy. Median OS was 26 months and 2-yr survival was 58.1%. The 2-yr OS for IIIA and IIIB patients was 61.8% and 42.4%, respectively. The overall 2-yr LF, RF, and DF rates were 30.4%, 32.9% and 54.9%, respectively. 2-yr DFS was 28.8%. In UVA, ECOG predicted for LF (PZ0.004) and RF (PZ0.006). DF was associated with N stage (N0/1/2 vs. N3; P = 0.013), ECOG (P = 0.03) and IIIA vs. IIIB (P = 0.011). N stage (P = 0.041), ECOG (PZ0.0001) and overall stage (PZ0.007) were predictive of DFS. Stage (P = 0.003) and ECOG (P = 0.002) predicted for improved OS. ECOG was significant on MVA for LF, RF, DF, DFS and OS, while N stage was predictive for RF, DF, DFS and OS. Toxicity was manageable: 10.6% had Grade 3 esophagitis and 15.7% and 1.9% had Grade 2 or 3 pneumonitis with no Grade 4/5 events. Esophageal ulceration and dilation rates were 16.2% and 10.6%, respectively. Esophagitis grade was predictive of ulceration (P = 0.0001) or dilation (P = 0.0001). N stage (P = 0.008) and overall stage (P = 0.022) were predictive of pneumonitis grade. Conclusion(s): Patients in our cohort were frailer and had more advanced disease than the 0617 patients. Despite this, we demonstrate that CT with an intermediate RT dose of 70 Gy leads to better outcomes than the 74 Gy arm in RTOG 0617 with less esophageal toxicity. Preliminary analysis suggests that omission of ECOG-2 patients leads to superior outcomes for 70 Gy compared with the 60 Gy patients in 0617; analysis is ongoing. ECOG was a major determinant of survival outcomes.",Excluded
439,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
381,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded

The present results refer to cytogenetic assessments in a study cohort of the population of Dolon, a settlement located on the NE boundary of the nuclear weapon test site, which was exposed to elevated doses of ionising radiation primarily due to the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949. Conventional cytogenetic analyses were carried out on 21 blood samples from individuals (more than 50 years old) living in Dolon since the very beginning of nuclear testing. A matched control group included 20 individuals living in non-contaminated areas. Higher frequencies of chromosome aberrations were found in the Dolon cohort compared to the control group, even though they remain within the range of the background levels reported for large normal human population studies on elderly individuals.",Included
1979,"The lack of cytotoxic effect and radioadaptive response in splenocytes of mice exposed to low level internal beta-particle irradiation through tritiated drinking water in vivo Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included
1191,"Peritumoral inflammatory reaction in non-melanoma skin cancers - histological and immunohistochemical study Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) are the most frequent types of cancer in white skin populations, all over the world. In the last 40 years, there was observed a rapid increase of their incidence, because of the UV radiations exposure and weather changes. Although its morbidity is a relatively modest one, the direct social costs of NMSCs are quite substantial due to a high incidence. Due to these reasons, numerous studies try to clarify the etiopathogenic mechanisms of NMSCs, to elaborate treatment and prevention measures. In the last years, a special attention was given to the relation between inflammation and skin cancer. In our study, we performed a histological and immunohistological evaluation of the inflammatory reaction on a number of 73 surgical exeresis pieces coming from the patients diagnosed with NMSCs. Of these, 21 were squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and 52 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). The peritumoral inflammatory reaction in NMSCs was an extremely variable one in intensity and distribution, from one case to another and even from one area to another within the same tumor, thus proving the complexity of the relations between tumor cells and the cells of the immune system. By comparing the intensity of the inflammatory reaction between the two main types of NMSCs, there was observed that in SCCs the inflammatory reaction was more intense in comparison to BCCs. Also, in SCC there was highlighted a more abundant inflammatory infiltrate in poorly differentiated carcinomas, in comparison to the well-differentiated ones. The presence of the immune system cells (T-lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells) among the tumoral cells, in a direct contact with these, makes us believe that between the two categories of cells there may appear mechanisms of intercellular communication, distinct from the mechanisms of paracrine signaling.",Excluded
650,"Gender difference in the development of ischemic heart disease in emergency workers of the Chernobyl accident Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0). It was shown that 25% of all male EW developed IHD in 11.7+/-0.5 years after irradiation, while the same number of EW-women after 15.5+/-1.3 years. Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included

Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study at an urban county trauma center of adults who presented to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. ED providers measured area of erythema and induration using a tape measure, and completed data sheets indicating comorbid conditions and the presence or absence of physical exam findings. Fever was defined as any recorded temperature > 38degreeC during the first six hours of ED evaluation. Result(s): Of the 734 patients enrolled, 96 (13.1%) had fever. Physical and laboratory exam findings associated with the presence of a fever in multivariable logistic regression were the area of erythema, particularly the largest quartile of area of erythema, 144-5,000 cm2, (odd ratio [OR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.6-5.2]) and leukocytosis (OR = 4.4, 95% CI [2.7-7.0]). Bullae, necrosis, streaks, adenopathy, and bone involvement on imaging were not associated with fever. Conclusion(s): Fever is uncommon in patients presenting to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI.

The aim was to retrospectively investigate correlations between potential predictive parameters and the occurrence of radiation-induced lung injury in patients with primary or secondary lung tumours treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Sixty patients (63 tumours) underwent SBRT, with a dose of 45 Gy in 3 fractions over 5 days or 26 Gy in single fraction. The following parameters were tested for correlation with Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) lung toxicity score: planning target volume (PTV), tumour location, primary vs. metastatic tumour, and Mean Lung Dose (in 2 Gy fractions, MLD2). Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) values were then estimated. Results. The median follow-up time was 30.9 months (range 6.756.7). RTOG grade 01 toxicity was observed in 54/63 (85.7%) and grade 23 in 9/63 (14.3%) cases. Mean values of MLD2 for RTOG grade 01 and 23 were respectively 11.2 Gy (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 10.112.3 Gy) and 20.3 Gy (95% CI 16.623.9 Gy). NTCP mean values for RTOG grade 01 and 23 were respectively 4% (95% CI 25.9%) and 37% (95% CI 11.662.3%). Univariate analysis, performed with t-Student test, showed a statistically significant difference between MLD2 values in the two groups (t = 5.93 and p <= 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed a good correlation between MLD2 and toxicity scores 23 (p = 0.008, odds ratio 1.5). From logistic regression relationship between the observed rates of grade 23 and MLD2, a D50=19.8 Gy and a 50=2.2 were obtained. From the sigmoid-shaped dose-response relationship between NTCP and MLD2, a D50=22.4 Gy and 50=2.2 were derived. Discussion. MLD2 is strongly associated to the risk of lung injury. Higher NTCP values are associated with a higher risk, but when comparing the expected to the observed toxicity rate, NTCP seems to underestimate the risk.",Excluded
1212,"Potential welfare impacts of kill-trapping European moles (Talpa europaea) using scissor traps and Duffus traps: A Post mortem examination study Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.Copyright © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.",Excluded
3111,"Targeted disruption of NBS1 reveals its roles in mouse development and DNA repair Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that shares some common defects with ataxia-telangiectasia. The gene product mutated in NBS, named NBS1, is a component of the Mre11 complex that is involved in DNA strand-break repair. To elucidate the physiological roles of NBS1, we disrupted the N-terminal exons of the NBS1 gene in mice. NBS1(m/m) mice are viable, growth retarded and hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). NBS1(m/m) mice exhibit multiple lymphoid developmental defects, and rapidly develop thymic lymphoma. In addition, female NBS1(m/m) mice are sterile due to oogenesis failure. NBS1(m/m) cells are impaired in cellular responses to IR and defective in cellular proliferation. Most systematic and cellular defects identified in NBS1(m/m) mice recapitulate those in NBS patients, and are essentially identical to those observed in Atm(-/-) mice. In contrast to Atm(-/-) mice, spermatogenesis is normal in NBS1(m/m) mice, indicating that distinct roles of ATM have differential requirement for NBS1 activity. Thus, NBS1 and ATM have overlapping and distinct functions in animal development and DNA repair.",Excluded
1800,"Significant Correlation Between Overall Survival and Mean Lung Dose in Lung Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) Background: After stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for medically inoperable stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), more patients die of comorbidities, particularly severe pulmonary insufficiency, than of tumor progression. The aim of this study was to evaluate correlation between lung biologically effective dose (BED) with an alpha/beta ratio of 3 Gy (BED3) and overall survival (OS) for these patients. Method(s): From 2012 to 2017, we have developed a prospectively updated institutional database for all first 100 consecutively treated patients with inoperable Stage 1 (T1T2N0M0) NSCLC. All SBRT were conducted on a Novalis Tx LINAC with two coplanar dynamic conformal arcs (84%) or with coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) (16%). Mean GTV and PTV were 8.6 cc and 50.8 cc, respectively. The marginal dose prescribed to the PTV was the 80% isodose line (IDL), i.e., 54 Gy in 3 fractions for 76 patients (BED10 = 126 Gy) and 50 Gy in 5 fractions for 24 patients (BED10 = 83.3 Gy). Pulmonary heterogeneity has been taken into account by using Monte Carlo or AAA algorithms. Median follow-up was 25 months. Result(s): At 1, 2, 3 and 5 years, local control (LC) was respectively 100, 98.2, 98.2, and 77.7%, and OS was respectively 83, 71.2, 58.1, and 33.2% (median OS was 49 months). Significant OS prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analysis were mean lung BED3 (HR = 1.14, p = 0.01) and PTV volume (HR = 1.01, p = 0.004). A mean lung BED3 <= 5 Gy was significantly associated with a doubling of median OS from 29 months to more than 60 months (not achieved, p = 0.0068). For patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) <= 40%, a mean lung BED3 <= 4 Gy was significantly associated with a doubling of median OS from 23 to 46 months (p = 0.019). Conclusion(s): Mean lung BED3 is strongly and significantly associated with OS in SBRT for inoperable Stage I NSCLC. For all treated patients, a mean lung BED3 <= 5 Gy lead to a doubling of median OS. This threshold value should be reduced to 4 Gy for patients with FEV1 <= 40%.© Copyright © 2020 Dupic, Biau, Molnar, Chassin, Dedieu, Lapeyre and Belliere-Calandry.",Excluded
2739,"Effect of topical melatonin on ultraviolet radiation-induced suppression of Mantoux reactions in humans BACKGROUND: Melatonin, the central neurohormone in circadian rhythm pathways, is recognized to have a variety of immune-enhancing effects. It has previously been shown to reduce ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced erythema in mice and in humans, but there are as yet no published studies on the effects of melatonin on UV-induced immunosuppression in humans., METHODS: We investigated the effects of topical melatonin on solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced suppression of Mantoux reactions in 16 healthy, Mantoux-positive volunteers. Melatonin (5%) and its vehicle were applied in a double-blinded manner to separate areas on the lower back, immediately after each of three consecutive daily ssUV exposures. Various sites on the back received either no irradiation or one of three-graded ssUV doses. Mantoux testing was performed at each site 24 h after the final irradiation, and assessed 72 h later using a reflectance erythema meter. In a separate group of 19 volunteers, the effect of melatonin on minimal erythema dose was assessed both visually and with an erythema meter., RESULTS: We found dose-responsive UV-induced suppression of the Mantoux response in the presence of both vehicle and melatonin; melatonin did not prevent UV-induced immunosuppression in this model. Melatonin was also found to have no effect on the minimal erythema dose., CONCLUSIONS: Melatonin conferred no protection against immune suppression or sunburn when applied topically to human skin immediately after irradiation.",Excluded
2466,"Selectively T cell-depleted allografts from hla-matched sibling donors followed by low-dose posttransplantation immunosuppression to improve transplantation outcome in patients with hematologic malignancies We evaluated a photodepletion technique to selectively deplete host-reacting T cells from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling stem cell transplantations with the goal of reducing posttransplantation immunosuppression to improve antimalignancy effects postallografting. Donor lymphocytes were stimulated with irradiated expanded recipient T lymphocytes in an ex vivo mixed lymphocyte reaction. Alloactivated T cells preferentially retaining the photosensitizer 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402) were eliminated by exposure to visible light. Twenty-four patients with hematologic malignancies (16 high risk) conditioned with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and totalbody irradiation received a CD34-selected stem cell allograft from an HLA-matched sibling along with 5 x 106/kg selectively depleted donor T cells. Low-dose cyclosporine was used for posttransplantation immunosuppression. Eleven patients survived at a median of 30 months. Probabilities (+/- SEM) for overall and disease-free survival are 39% +/- 12% and 30% +/- 12%, respectively, whereas grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 13% +/- 7%. Six patients relapsed, with a relapse probability of 27% +/- 10%. These results suggest that selectively photodepleted allografts in matched sibling transplantations followed by low-dose immunosuppression may protect against severe aGVHD but is associated with delayed immune recovery. © 2011.",Excluded
2351,"Incidence and nature of tumors induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by gamma-irradiation In our previous studies carried out on inbred rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain (L. Gross and Y. Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 5910-5913, 1979), the tumor incidence was increased following irradiation (150 rads, 5 times, at weekly intervals), from 22 to 93% in females and from 5 to 59% in males. Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively. In the third group, among rats which received 4 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 17 of 19 females (89.4%) and 4 of 12 males (33.3%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.4 and 10.5 mo, respectively. The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included

We conducted a 10-week prospective study of a convenience sample of patients transported to a level one trauma center immobilized with a backboard and cervical collar. Total backboard time (TBT) was measured from the time the ambulance left the scene to the time the patient was removed from the backboard, while total ED backboard time (TEDBT) was measured from the time of arrival at the ED to the time of backboard removal. There were 138 patients entered in the study. Insufficient data excluded 36 patients from further analysis. TBT was available for 92 patients and averaged 63.63 (+/-45.87) minutes. Dividing patients into those who were removed from the backboard prior to radiographs (n = 85), the TBT average was 53.9 minutes (+/-30.1), whereas the average for those who had radiographs prior to removal from the backboard (n = 7) was 181.3 minutes (+/-41.6). There were 102 patients for whom TEDBT was available and averaged 48.36 (+/-44.88) minutes.

2446,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included

However, given increased cancer risk associated with ionizing radiation exposure, our purpose is to evaluate the utility of routine scans for these patients., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series., SETTING: Houston, Texas., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A 5-year review of patients with VFMI diagnosed at an academic institution was conducted. For patients without an apparent cause (eg, recent head, neck, or cardiothoracic surgery or known malignancy), CT head/neck and chest was performed to evaluate the recurrent laryngeal nerve course. Data included demographics, symptoms, radiography, and interventions. Statistical analyses were performed via chi(2) analysis., RESULTS: Of 406 patients with VFMI, 47 (11%) patients had no apparent cause clinically. Routine CT revealed abnormalities in 10 (21%) patients, of which only 3 (6%) could account for VFMI: benign thyroid adenoma (1), papillary thyroid cancer (1), and an esophageal mass (1). The most common lesion detected involved the thyroid. Demographic data and symptom type were not significantly associated with detection of a VFMI-attributable lesion on CT. Overall, routine CT did not identify a focal etiology in 94% patients with VFMI without an apparent cause., CONCLUSION: Routine pan-CT evaluation failed to reveal an etiology in 94% of patients with VFMI without an apparent cause. Patients may be subjected to health risks associated with radiation exposure without significant diagnostic benefit. Further studies should consider more judicious use of CT in the context of risk factors and safer imaging modalities as the initial diagnostic step.

3330,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
1464,"DNA Damage Baseline Predicts Resilience to Space Radiation and Radiotherapy Deep space exploration will require real-time, minimally invasive monitoring of astronaut health to mitigate the potential health impairments caused by space radiation and microgravity. Genotoxic stress in humans can be monitored by quantifying the amount of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immune cells from a simple finger prick. In a cohort of 674 healthy donors, we show that the endogenous level of DSBs increases with age and with latent cytomegalovirus infection. To map the range of human responses to space radiation, we then study DSB induction and repair in immune cells from 319 healthy donors after the cells are exposed to galactic cosmic ray components and lymphocytes from 30 cancer patients after radiotherapy. Individuals with low baseline DSB have fewer clinical complications, enhanced DNA damage repair responses, and a functional dose-dependent cytokine response in healthy donor cells. This supports the use of DSB monitoring for health resilience in space., Pariset et al. find that individuals with a lower baseline level of DNA damage are resilient to clinical complications after radiotherapy and present higher radiation-induced levels of DNA repair foci and inflammatory cytokines. These findings support the use of baseline DNA damage as a biomarker for radiation sensitivity.Copyright © 2020",Included
3087,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included
1110,"In vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts can identify a group of radiotherapy patients having developed complications in a variety of normal tissues Purpose. - A retrospective study of the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe complications. Patients and methods. - Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. Results. - The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Conclusion. - The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy.",Excluded

However, ypTNM stage, especially ypN stage does not predict patient survival after NCRT well. Whether tumor regression in lymph nodes (LRG) may improve the prediction has not been well studied. In total, 358 patients with rectal cancer who received NCRT followed by radical resection were recruited from 2004 to 2015, and the median follow-up time was 57.5 months. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). In univariate analysis, factors associated with DFS were ypT stage, ypN stage, number of negative lymph nodes (NLN), lymph node ratio (LNR), tumor regression grade (TRG), M-TTRG (modified ypT stage by combining ypT stage and TRG), maximum LRG (LRGmax), sum score of LRG (LRGsum), LRG ratio (average value of LRGsum), and M-NLRG (modified ypN stage by combining LRGmax and LNR). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, M-TTRG and M-NLRG (p < 0.001 and p = 0.030, respectively) were significantly associated with DFS. The estimated 5-year DFS rates were 86.6%, 60.3%, and 36.4% for patients with M-NLRG-0, M-NLRG-1, and M-NLRG-2, respectively (p < 0.001). A significant difference in survival was observed among patients with NCRT after incorporating TRG and LRG simultaneously into the current ypTNM staging system (p < 0.001). LRG was an important prognostic factor in rectal cancer patients treated with NCRT and could refine the ypTNM staging system. The modified ypTNM staging system in combination with LRGmax, LNR, and TRG could improve the DFS prediction in each subset of patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

1641,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine? OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded

561,"Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for tonsillar carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background: We performed this study to analyze treatment outcomes and to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with tonsillar carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with tonsillar carcinoma treated with RT between January 1979 and September 2009. Of the 164 patients, 91 were treated with 2-dimensional RT (2D-RT), 46 were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), and 27 were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). When patients were treated with IMRT, simultaneous integrated boost was used. Thirty patients were treated with RT alone, 40 patients were treated with chemotherapy and RT (CRT), 66 patients were treated with surgery and RT and/or chemotherapy (SRT), and 28 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Bilateral neck irradiation was delivered to 141 patients, and ipsilateral neck irradiation to 23 patients. In definitive RT, median dose was 70 Gy (range, 51-71), 70 Gy (54-74), and 67.5 Gy for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. In postoperative RT, median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 54-70.2), 66 Gy (54-70), and 63 Gy (60-67.5) for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. Acute and late toxicity were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 42 months (range, 2-288). The 5-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 94%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, 5-year DFS rate was associated with the RT technique (2DRT, 77%; 3D-CRT, 82%; IMRT, 100%, p = 0.035), T stage (T1-2, 87%; T3-4, 74%, p = 0.036), and treatment modality (RT alone, 55%; CRT, 78%; SRT, 92%; CCRT, 92%, p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, advanced T stage and treatment modality were statistically significant prognostic factors in DFS rate. None of the patients who were treated with ipsilateral neck irradiation experienced relapse in contralateral neck nodes. After the completion of RT, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade >=2 xerostomia 91%, 58%, 59%, 35%, and 78%, respectively. At least 6 months of follow-up, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade <=1 xerostomia 52%, 76%, 78%, 98%, and 63%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In selected patients with well lateralized tonsillar carcinoma, ipsilateral neck irradiation can be an alternative to bilateral neck irradiation, regarding DFS rate and complications. There was no failure when patients were treated with IMRT, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the 72.0 Gy in 42 fractions/6 weeks). The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate of patients who completed >= 70% of the cetuximab planned dose administration (in terms of the relative dose intensity of cetuximab) and the full dose of radiotherapy >= 2 weeks over the planned schedule (in terms of radiotherapy duration >=8 weeks). Result(s): From Mar 2009 until Jan 2010, 27 pts were screened. Of them, 22 pts were enrolled and treated (ITT population). Patients characteristics of ITT population: median age (years), 67.0 (range, 53 to 81); male/female, 21/1 pts; oropharynx/hypopharynx/larynx, 6/8/8 pts; stage III/IV, 12/10 pts. The median duration of cetuximab treatment was 7.9 weeks (range, 7 to 9), and that of RT was 44.0 days (range, 40 to 52). All 22 pts completed the treatment, and the completion rate was 100% (95% CI: 84.6%, 100.0%). The response rate (CR+PR) post RT was 81.8% (assessed by the independent committee). All pts experienced AEs. Most common AEs with grade 3/4 were mucosal inflammation (16pts, 72.7%), dermatitis (6pts, 27.3%), infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (each in 5 pts, 22.7%). Conclusion(s): The completion rate (100%) and the response rate (81.8%) are comparable to those of the cetuximab + RT group in the multinational randomized phase III study (Bonner et al. 2006). AEs were consistent with the underlying disease, administration of RT or cetuximab.

2076,"Hyperthermia and radiation therapy for inoperable or recurrent parotid carcinoma. A phase I/II study BACKGROUND: The treatment of advanced, inoperable, or recurrent parotid tumors represents a clinical challenge. The results obtained with conventional radiotherapy are disappointing. To improve the early response and local control of parotid tumors, local microwave hyperthermia was used in combination with ionizing radiation in a biinstitutional Phase I/II study., METHODS: From 1984 to 1991, 13 patients (20 lesions) with advanced (10 lesions) or recurrent (10 lesions) parotid tumors (15 primaries and the remaining 5 nodal metastases), were treated with 300-915 MHz of external hyperthermia after external irradiation. Heat was applied twice weekly at a minimum desired temperature of 42.0 degrees C for 30 minutes at steady state. Ionizing radiation was delivered using photon, electron, or mixed electron-photon beams; the prescribed total dose was 70 Gy and 30 Gy for untreated and previously treated lesions, respectively; the median computed total dose was 66 Gy for previously untreated patients (range, 56-70 Gy) and 30 Gy for previously irradiated patients (range, 28-32 Gy)., RESULTS: Acute side effects were limited. Major acute toxicities included three patients (15%) with superficial necrosis, two of three who healed spontaneously in 4 and 6 months. Clinical response evaluated during the third month after the completion of therapy found that 16/20 patients (80%) had a complete response (CR), and 4 (20%) had a partial response. Four out of 16 patients who had CRs (20%) had a local recurrence, resulting in an actuarial local control at 5 years of 62.3 +/- 13.2%., CONCLUSIONS: The combined treatment of local microwave hyperthermia and ionizing radiation proved to be feasible and moderately toxic for patients with advanced, inoperable, or recurrent parotid tumors. Even if clinical result evaluation was not the study endpoint, early response, and 5-year local control rates were encouraging.",Excluded
288,"Patient effective radiation dose and associated risk from transmission scans using 153Gd line sources in cardiac SPECT studies The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of transmission measurements acquisition to total patient effective dose from cardiac SPECT studies. A dual-head L-shaped gamma camera equipped with a transmission scan acquisition system based on two 153Gd line sources was used to simulate transmission measurements acquisition exposure on an anthropomorphic phantom. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to directly monitor the dose to 550 measuring points in the phantom. The effective dose and associated risk from transmission scans acquisition were estimated and compared to those associated to the radiopharmaceutical injected. The maximum effective dose from a typical transmission measurements acquisition was 1.3 muSv and 1.9 muSv for male and female patients, respectively. The contribution of the typical transmission scans acquisition to total patient radiation risk from a cardiac SPECT study is less than 10-3. Thus, radiation exposure may not be considered as a limiting factor for the clinical application of attenuation correction methods based on transmission measurements in cardiac SPECT.",Excluded

Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed., RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor.

3281,"Prior exposure to medical and dental x-rays related to tumors of the parotid gland Findings from this population-based study in Los Angeles County suggest, for the first time, that tumors of the parotid gland are related to prior exposure to diagnostic medical and dental radiography. Responses to interviews with 408 patients with a parotid tumor (269 benign tumors and 139 malignant tumors) were compared to responses of 408 neighborhood controls. Cumulative exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic radiography was associated with a dose-related increase in risk of malignant tumors (P for trend less than .05; relative risk for exposure to greater than or equal to 50 rad = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-11.46). Benign tumors showed a weaker positive association, and exposure before age 20 to a major diagnostic examination (full-mouth or panoramic dental radiography or medical radiography to the head) increased risk (relative risk = 1.8; confidence interval = 1.13-2.91). This study also confirmed the association of malignant tumors with prior radiation treatment to the head or neck; 28% of these tumors are attributable to exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic and therapeutic radiation.",Included
885,"Lung dosimetry of inhaled radon progeny in mice Biological response of exposure to radon progeny has long been investigated, but there are only few studies in which absorbed doses in lungs of laboratory animals were estimated. The present study is the first attempt to calculate the doses of inhaled radon progeny for mice. For reference, the doses for rats and humans were also computed with the corresponding models. Lung deposition of particles, their clearance, and energy deposition of alpha particles to sensitive tissues were systematically simulated. Absorbed doses to trachea and bronchi, bronchioles and terminal bronchioles, alveolar-interstitial regions, and whole lung were first provided as a function of monodisperse radon progeny particles with an equilibrium equivalent radon concentration of 1 Bq m(-3) (equilibrium factor, 0.4 and unattached fraction, 0.01). Based on the results, absorbed doses were then calculated for (1) a reference mine condition and (2) a condition previously used for animal experiments. It was found that the whole lung doses for mice, rats, and humans were 34.8, 20.7, and 10.7 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the mine condition, respectively, while they were 16.9, 9.9, and 6.5 nGy (Bq m(-3))(-1) h(-1) for the animal experimental condition. In both cases, the values for mice are about 2 times higher than those for rats, and about 3 times higher than those for humans. Comparison of our data on rats and humans with those published in the literature shows an acceptable agreement, suggesting the validity of the present modeling for mice. In the future, a more sophisticated dosimetric study of inhaled radon progeny in mice would be desirable to demonstrate how anatomical, physiological, and environmental parameters can influence absorbed doses.",Excluded
2487,"Stereotactic radiosurgery combined with nivolumab or Ipilimumab for patients with melanoma brain metastases: Evaluation of brain control and toxicity Purpose: To investigate the efficacy and safety of concurrent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and ipilimumab or nivolumab in patients with untreated melanoma brain metastases. Patients and Methods: Eighty consecutive patients with 326 melanoma brain metastases receiving SRS in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab were identified from an institutional database and retrospectively evaluated. Patients started systemic treatment with intravenous nivolumab or ipilimumab within one week of receiving SRS. Nivolumab was given at doses of 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Ipilimumab was administered up to four doses of 10 mg/kg, one every 3 weeks, then patients had a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks, until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint of the study was intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were extracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), and neurological toxicity. Result(s): Eighty patients were analyzed. Forty-five patients received SRS and ipilimumab, and 35 patients received SRS and nivolumab. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the 6-month and 12-month intracranial PFS rates were 69% (95%CI,54-87%) and 42% (95%CI,24-65%) for patients receiving SRS and nivolumab and 48% (95%CI,34-64%) and 17% (95%CI,5-31%) for those treated with SRS and ipilimumab (p = 0.02), respectively. Extracranial PFS and OS were 37 and 78% in SRS and nivolumab group, respectively, and 17 and 68% in SRS and ipilimumab group, respectively, at 12 months. Sub-group analysis showed significantly better intracranial PFS for patients receiving multi-fraction SRS (3 x 9 Gy) compared to single-fraction SRS (70% versus 46% at 6 months, p = 0.01), especially in combination with nivolumab. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 (24%) patients treated with SRS and ipilimumab and 6 (17%) patients who received SRS and nivolumab. Radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) occurred in 15% of patients. Conclusion(s): Concurrent SRS and ipilimumab or nivolumab show meaningful intracranial activity in patients with either asymptomatic and symptomatic melanoma brain metastases, although a subset of patients may develop symptomatic RN. The combination of nivolumab with SRS is associated with better intracranial control.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
927,"The effect of MC1R variants and sunscreen on the response of human melanocytes in vivo to ultraviolet radiation and implications for melanoma Summary: We conducted a clinical trial to compare the molecular and cellular responses of human melanocytes and keratinocytes in vivo to solar-simulated ultraviolet radiation (SSUVR) in 57 Caucasian participants grouped according to MC1R genotype. We found that, on average, the density of epidermal melanocytes 14 days after exposure to 2 minimal erythemal dose (MED) SSUVR was twofold higher than baseline (unirradiated) skin. However, the change in epidermal melanocyte counts among people carrying germline MC1R variants (97% increase) was significantly less than those with wild-type MC1R (164% increase; P = 0.01). We also found that sunscreen applied to the skin before exposure to 2 MED SSUVR completely blocked the effects of DNA damage, p53 induction, and cellular proliferation in both melanocytes and keratinocytes. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

2646,"[Reliability of the diagnostic results obtained with confined quantities of the contrast medium in endolymphatic radionuclide therapy (ELRT) of the inferior limbs (author's transl)] Endolymphatic radionuclide therapy (ELRT) produces not only a radiotherapeutic effect on the lymph nodes but makes possible also to judge of the lymph nodes being stained with labelled lipiodol UF. With the purpose of avoiding an eventual radiation exposure of the lung, or at least of confining it to a minimum, only limited quantities not exceeding 3.5 ml (5 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) of the oily contrast medium for unilateral, or twice 3.5 ml (together 4 mCi of 32P; 0.5 mCi of 131I) for bilateral application. A retrospective analysis of 245 patients of the study group for endolymphatic radionuclide therapy, who suffered from malignant melanomas of the inferior limbs, revealed 77.5% of correct diagnoses. Most of the false-positive findings (44/70) seem to be due to the knowledge of the primary disease, as 77% of these cases had been described as ""suspicious"". False-negative findings turned out in 5% only. The findings which had been characterized as ""surely positive"" proved reliable in 90%.

660,"A little to a lot or a lot to a little? An analysis of pneumonitis risk from dose-volume histogram parameters of the lung in patients with lung cancer treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy PURPOSE: To determine whether a little dose to a large normal lung volume or a high dose to a small lung volume is more critical for induction of clinical pneumonitis. The second question is if dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters are more reliable, if the lungs are analyzed as separate organs or as a whole organ., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and DVH data from 49 patients treated for a thoracic malignancy using 3-D conformal treatment plans. 18 patients had developed a clinical pneumonitis (CTC II or III). The majority of patients (n = 48) received radiochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients were generally treated 5 fx/week, single dose 2 Gy, using a two-series approach (shrinking field) up to a total dose of 60-70 Gy. For every individual patient, the overall dose distribution was recalculated in the Helax-TMS by means of adding dose plans according to the total dose applied in each series. The lungs were defined both as separate organs and as a whole organ. Low-dose volume ( 10-40 Gy, Vmod) and high-dose volume (> 40 Gy, Vhigh), as well as V10-V40 and mean lung dose (MLD) were defined from the cumulative DVH. Dose-effect relationships were fitted with a logistic regression model., RESULTS: Manifestation of clinical pneumonitis was within 3 months from termination of irradiation in all cases. For the ipsilateral lung, the incidence of pneumonitis was closely correlated to Vhigh. The pneumonitis rate increased from 13% up to 60%. By contrast, with increasing Vlow the pneumonitis rate dropped to < 10%. A similar but less pronounced effect was seen for the total lung. The lung volumes Vlow, Vmod and Vhigh of the ipsilateral, contralateral and whole lung were significantly correlated to the corresponding MLD. The incidence of pneumonitis increased with increasing MLD for the ipsilateral lung with a D50 of 32 Gy and a gamma 50 of 0.98. For the whole lung, the observed increase was less steep. MLD showed a close correlation to NTCP calculated by the Kutcher model. However, NTCP calculation overestimated the pneumonitis risk for the ipsilateral lung and underestimated the risk for the whole lung due to the steeper gradient. The logistic regression curve for the DVH parameters V10-V40 showed an increase of steepness toward higher doses. From the logistic regression curves, a DVH template indicating critical borders of V10-V40 was generated for the ipsilateral as well as for the total lung., CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that it is reasonable to disperse the dose outside the target volume over large areas in order to reduce the volumes of lung receiving > 40 Gy. Reducing the high-dose volume reduces the pneumonitis rate more than a corresponding reduction in the low-dose regions of the DVH. Landmarks for DVH optimization as defined in this analysis may serve as a basis for DVH contrains in IMRT planning. Separate organ analysis produced more reliable results and should be preferred to whole-organ analysis, if techniques mainly involving one side of the lung are applied. Further validation of these constraints is necessary prior to general recommendation.",Excluded
1737,"Diagnosing Fish Bone and Chicken Bone Impactions in the Emergency Department Setting: Measuring the System Utility of the Plain Film Screen OBJECTIVES: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage., METHODS: We reviewed patients >= 18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05)., CONCLUSIONS: X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility.

969,"Treatment of haemorrhagic radiation-induced proctopathy using small volume topical formalin instillation BACKGROUND: Between 2 and 5% of patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy develop chronic radiation proctopathy, occurring as a result of damage to the rectal mucosa during the treatment. Rectal bleeding of varying severity can occur as a consequence. There have been no formal trials of treatment for haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy and a variety of methods are currently used., AIM: In a retrospective study of 20 patients treated at a single centre, we assessed the efficacy of small volume topical formalin instillation to control bleeding from radiation proctopathy., METHOD: Patients were treated by a single operator using 20 mL of a 5% solution of formalin instilled into the rectum via a flexible sigmoidoscope for 3 min. Patients were followed up for an average of 22.7 months (range: 2-69)., RESULTS: A single session of formalin treatment was effective in 13 of 20 (65%) patients and a further four (20%) patients responded to a second treatment. No complications of the treatment was identified., CONCLUSION: Small volume formalin instillation therapy appears to be safe and effective in the context of haemorrhagic radiation proctopathy. The technique is simple, inexpensive, quick and requires no sedation. We suggest that it should be considered as a first line for patients presenting with this distressing condition.",Excluded
606,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded

A total of 57,426 men and 71,018 women diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2001 and receiving radiotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry database. In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%.

3252,"High dietary potassium intake as measured by 24-hour urine collection is associated with lower risk of ulcerative colitis Background: Recent animal studies have identified dietary salt intake as an environmental factor that may modify the risk and progression of autoimmune disorders through its effect on IL-23/Th-17 pathway. Because of the critical role of this pathway in pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), we sought to examine the association between pre-diagnosis mineral intakes measured by the gold standard, 24-hour urinary excretion, and subsequent risk of incident UC and CD. Method(s): We conducted a prospective case-control study nested among 1,487 women (median age = 65) enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I, 1,414 women (median age = 50) enrolled in the NHSII, and 1,136 men (median age = 63) enrolled in the Health Professional Follow up Study (HPFS) from whom we collected urine for 24 hours in 1995-1996. Diagnoses of incident CD and UC reported through 2009 in NHSII and 2010 in NHSI and HPFS were confirmed through review of medical records by two gastroenterologists. We documented 87 cases of UC and 50 cases of CD after urine collection. Urinary calcium and magnesium were measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer; urinary creatinine, uric acid, citrate, and phosphorus were measured by a Cobas centrifugal analyzer; urinary sodium and potassium were determined directly by flame emission photometry. The coefficients of variation for all analytes were <10%. We examined the association of each analyte according to quartile categories and as continuous variables using logistic regression models adjusting for age, cohort, BMI, and smoking to estimate relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result(s): The median prediagnostic 24-hour urinary potassium concentration was 60.5 mEq/ L among 87 UC cases; 60.9 ng/dl among 50 CD cases; and 62.9 mEq/L among 3,561 controls without UC or CD . Compared to participants in the lowest quartile of prediagnostic urinary potassium, the multivariate-adjusted RRs for UC were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.55-1.73) for the second quartile; 0.67 (95% CI, 0.35-1.28) for the third quartile; and 0.57 (0.28-1.16) for the highest quartile (Plinear trend = .03). In contrast, we did not observe any consistent association between prediagnostic urinary potassium and risk of CD (Plinear trend =.80). We did not observe any association between urinary sodium, creatinine, uric acid, citrate, or phosphorous and risk of UC or CD (all Plinear trends > .20). Conclusion : Dietary potassium intake as measured by 24 hour urinary potassium excretion is associated with a lower risk of UC but not CD. The recent observation that salt modifies the effect of critical immune mechanisms such as TH17/IL-23 pathway may underlie these findings. Future studies on the influence of intake of high potassium foods and supplements on the risk and progression of UC are warranted.",Excluded

All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >or=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >or=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects., CONCLUSIONS: Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications.

Primary outcome measures were safety and efficacy of the PAF (absolute change in hemoglobin [Hb] and K, respectively, in patient's blood values after transfusing the irradiated RBC units with or without the PAF)., RESULTS: A total of 63 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 17 patients in the control group, and a total of 56 irradiated RBC units were transfused to 13 patients in the PAF group. The absolute change of Hb (9.3 +/- 6.3 g/L vs. 8.1 +/- 5.8 g/L; p = 0.3) and the absolute change of K (-0.01 +/- 0.4 mmol/L vs. -0.01 +/- 0.3 mmol/L; p = 0.2) were comparable between the two groups of the trial., CONCLUSION: The transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the PAF was as safe and efficacious as the transfusion of 1 irradiated RBC unit with the standard blood infusion set in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.

870,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients. No radiation colitis or neuropathy occurred. Moderate-dose IORT and EBRT is safe, taking into account related late toxicities. It is an effective local treatment approach, resulting in an encouraging local control rate.",Excluded
2400,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC. There is no delay in administration of radiation or chemotherapy, and radiation is completed with minimal toxicity. © 2013 Gurka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Objective(s): Parameters determining the individual protective effect of a pharmacological intervention were investigated. Design and Participants: Biokinetics of 123I was evaluated in 27 healthy volunteers (aged 22-46 yr, median 25 yr, in total 48 assessments) twice in a baseline measurement of the undisturbed kinetics and in an intervention assessment 48 h later. Intervention(s): Seven regimens using single doses of potassium iodide (KI) or sodium perchlorate (SP) at different times relative to exposure were compared: 100 mg KI (-24, 2, 8, 24 h), 100 mg SP (2 h), or 1 g SP (2, 8 h). Main Outcome Measure(s): Different drugs and dosages and the influence of individual parameters of iodine kinetics should be tested.

1668,"Comparison of two barium suspensions for dedicated small-bowel series OBJECTIVE. The in vivo radiographic features of two commercially available formulations of barium used as contrast media in dedicated small- bowel series were compared. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-six consecutive outpatients referred for a dedicated small-bowel series were randomly administered either E-Z-Paque or Entrobar. Representative survey radiographs from each examination were randomized and reviewed by six gastrointestinal radiologists from three institutions. Each observer assigned a numeric score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, and 4 = excellent) that rated the quality of the radiograph with respect to these characteristics: definition of fold pattern, translucency, distention, and integrity of the barium column. Statistical analysis was performed for each characteristic using Wilcoxon's two-sample rank sum test. RESULTS. All six observers found a statistically significant difference between the two barium formulations for mean scores for definition of fold pattern and translucency. Mean scores for fold pattern were 3.3, 3.0, 3.2, 3.6, 3.3, and 3.4 for Entrobar and 2.1, 2.3, 2.4, 3.2, 2.6, and 2.7 for E-Z-Paque. Mean scores for translucency were 2.5, 2.7, 2.8, 3.1, 2.7, and 3.3 for Entrobar and 1.6, 1.7, 2.1, 2.3, 1.9, and 2.7 for E-Z- Paque. No statistically significant difference was found for mean score for distention or integrity of the barium column. CONCLUSION. On radiographs, Entrobar was found to have superior characteristics for visualization of fold pattern and translucency but offered no advantages for distention or integrity of the barium column. Improved translucency and definition of fold pattern may translate into improved sensitivity and confidence in diagnosing small-bowel abnormality.",Excluded

The first protocol (3 cycles of DDP-VP16 + 45 Gy) was used in 37 patients: toxicity was not negligible; a clinical tumor downstaging was obtained in 54% of cases; an R0 resection surgery was performed in 40% of patients. The overall median survival of the whole group of 37 patients was 11 months, while it was > 36 months for patients undergoing R0 resection. The second protocol (4 cycles of DDP-5FU + 45 Gy) was used in 25 patients: a clinical tumor downstaging was obtained in 55% of cases, and R0 resection surgery was performed in 45% of patients. The overall median survival of the whole group was 11 months. To date, all patients but one (who died after 13 months) are alive with a median follow up of 13 months. The prognosis of both groups of patients was improved compared to patients with T4 SCC of the esophagus who did not undergo chemo and/or radiotherapy. The survival advantage was especially evident for those who were able to undergo an R0 resection.

3195,"PET/MRI for staging patients with Hodgkin lymphoma: equivalent results with PET/CT in a prospective trial To compare FDG-PET/unenhanced MRI and FDG-PET/diagnostic CT in detecting infiltration in patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The endpoint was equivalence between PET/MRI and PET/CT in correctly defining the revised Ann Arbor staging system. Seventy consecutive patients with classical-HL were prospectively investigated for nodal and extra-nodal involvement during pretreatment staging with same-day PET/CT and PET/MRI. Findings indicative of malignancy with the imaging procedures were regarded as lymphoma infiltration; in case of discrepancy, positive-biopsy and/or response to treatment were evidenced as lymphoma. Sixty of the 70 (86%) patients were evaluable having completed the staging program. Disease staging based on either PET/MRI or PET/CT was correct for 54 of the 60 patients (90% vs. 90%), with difference between proportions of 0.0 (95% CI, -9 to 9%; P=0.034 for the equivalence test). As compared with reference standard, invasion of lymph nodes was identified with PET/MRI in 100% and with PET/CT in 100%, of the spleen with PET/MRI in 66% and PET/CT in 55%, of the lung with PET/MRI in 60% and PET/CT in 100%, of the liver with PET/MRI in 67% and PET/CT in 100%, and of the bone with PET/MRI in 100% and PET/CT in 50%. The only statistically significant difference between PET/MRI and PET/CT was observed in bony infiltration detection rates. For PET/CT, iodinate contrast medium infusions' average was 86 mL, and exposure to ionizing radiation was estimated to be 4-fold higher than PET/MRI.

1812,"Optimized demineralization of human cancellous bone by application of a vacuum Human demineralized bone matrix derived from cortical bone is used by surgeons due to its ability to promote bone formation. There is also a need for shaped demineralized bone matrices made from cancellous bone, where the properties of the material allow its insertion into defects, therefore acting as a void filler and scaffold onto which new bone can form. In this study, we report that demineralized bone sponges were prepared by dissecting and cutting knee bone into cancellous bone cubes of 1 cm3. These cubes were then taken through a series of warm water washes, some with sonication, centrifugation, and two decontamination chemical washes. The cubes were optimally demineralized into sponges with 0.5N hydrochloric acid under vacuum with constant pH measurement. Demineralization was confirmed by quantitative measurement of calcium and qualitatively by compression. The sponges were freeze dried before terminal sterilisation with a target dose of 25 kGy gamma radiation whilst frozen. Samples of the sponges were histologically examined for calcium and collagen and also tested for osteoinductivity. Data showed well defined collagen staining in the sponges, with little residual calcium. Sponges from two out of three donors demonstrated osteoinductivity when implanted into the muscle of an athymic mouse.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
45,"Optimizing radiation exposure in screening of body packing: image quality and diagnostic acceptability of an 80 kVp protocol with automated tube current modulation The aim of this study was to evaluate the objective and subjective image quality of a novel computed tomography (CT) protocol with reduced radiation dose for body packing with 80 kVp and automated tube current modulation (ATCM) compared to a standard body packing CT protocol. 80 individuals who were examined between March 2012 and July 2015 in suspicion of ingested drug packets were retrospectively included in this study. Thirty-one CT examinations were performed using ATCM and a fixed tube voltage of 80 kVp (group A). Forty-nine CT examinations were performed using a standard protocol with a tube voltage of 120 kVp and a fixed tube current time product of 40 mAs (group B). Subjective and objective image quality and visibility of drug packets were assessed. Radiation exposure of both protocols was compared. Contrast-to-noise ratio (group A: 0.56 +/- 0.36; group B: 1.13 +/- 0.91) and Signal-to-noise ratio (group A: 3.69 +/- 0.98; group B: 7.08 +/- 2.67) were significantly lower for group A compared to group B (p < 0.001). Subjectively, image quality was decreased for group A compared to group B (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4; p < 0.001). Attenuation of body packets was higher with the new protocol (group A: 362.2 +/- 70.3 Hounsfield Units (HU); group B: 210.6 +/- 60.2 HU; p = 0.005). Volumetric Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) and Dose Length Product (DLP) were significantly lower in group A (CTDIvol 2.2 +/- 0.9 mGy, DLP 105.7 +/- 52.3 mGycm) as compared to group B (CTDIvol 2.7 +/- 0.1 mGy, DLP 126.0 +/- 9.7 mGycm, p = 0.002 and p = 0.01). The novel 80 kVp CT protocol with ATCM leads to a significant dose reduction compared to a standard CT body packing protocol.

3033,"Solo sonographically guided PCNL under spinal anesthesia-results of 165 cases Aim: The well-known serious harms of radiation have encouraged surgeons to use it as low as necessary. Hence, sonography was brought in as an adjunct to X-Ray to restrict radiation exposure in PCNL. This study was designed to respond this question that is sonography proper enough to supersede X-Ray in PCNL? Methods: 165 consecutive cases were prospectively enrolled. All steps of access to the system, single shot tract dilatation and residue checking were performed solely under sonography guidance; i.e. without any usage of x-ray under spinal anesthesia. Decision to place a nephrostomy tube was made based on the surgeon's judgment on the system injury or bleeding. Result(s): male to female ratio was 5/3. Mean age was 46+/-15 years. Forty percent of kidneys showed hydronephrosis and 20 percent of stones were nonopaque. Mean stone burden was 504+/-350 mm2. Mean duration of surgery was 42+/-21 minutes. Stone free rate was 85% in patients with single pelvic stone and 75% in staghorn cases. Mean residual stone size was 15+/-9 mm. Admission time was 2 days on average. Fifteen percent of patients showed grade I or II complication and in six percent grade III complication occurred based on Clavien classification. There was no case organ injury or death. Complication rate was directly related to surgery duration. Conclusion(s): Sonographically guided PCNL is feasible with acceptable stone free rate and complication.",Excluded
1407,"The morphologic effects of radiation administered therapeutically for intracranial gliomas: a postmortem study of 25 cases To investigate the pathologic consequences of therapeutic radiation, this morphologic study evaluated the brains of 25 patients with intracranial gliomas treated both with and without this form of therapy. Although beneficial effects such as the retardation of tumor growth were evident in these studies, among the seventeen patients who received from 5000--6000 rads for malignant gliomas, four developed ""late delayed"" radiation necrosis. The strong predilection of this tissue response for the white matter adjacent to the neoplasm suggests a local sensitivity which may have been engendered or enhanced by cerebral edema. A fifth case disclosed focal demyelination in the mid-brain suggesting ""early delayed"" radiation necrosis, and an additional case had distinctive foci of necrosis within the brain stem. Changes of diffuse cerebral edema were noted in many of the radiated brains. It is concluded that radiation therapy in commonly employed dosages for malignant gliomas carries a risk of injury to surrounding cerebral tissues.",Included

All but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 51 patients, 33 received combinations of X-rays (median 46 Gy) and protons (median 36 GyE) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-rays and proton radiation for these 33 patients was 80 GyE (range 70-90 GyE). The other 18 patients received proton-beam therapy alone (median 79 GyE, range 62-98 GyE)., RESULTS: Treatment interruption due to radiation-induced esophagitis or hematologic toxicity was not required for any patient. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 51 patients was 21.1% and the median survival time was 20.5 months (95% confidence interval 10.9-30.2). Of the 51 patients, 40 (78%) showed a complete response within 4 months after completing treatment and seven (14%) showed a partial response, giving a response rate of 92% (47/51).

Doses of 60-71 Gy with 2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction were applied. 26/29 patients were definitively irradiated, 86% received simultaneous cisplatin-based chemotherapy. 60% presented with locally advanced disease (T3/4 Nx, Tx N2c/3). Mean primary tumor volume measured 36.2 cm(3) (4-170 cm(3)), mean nodal volume 16.6 cm(3) (0-97 cm(3))., RESULTS: 2-year actuarial local, nodal, distant control, and overall disease-free survival were 90%, 93%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. In 2/4 patients with persistent disease (nodal in one, primary in three), salvage surgery was performed. The mean dose to the spinal cord (extension of > 5-15 mm) was 26 Gy (12-38 Gy); the mean maximum (point) dose was 44.4 Gy (26-58.9 Gy). One grade (G) 3 dysphagia and two G4 reactions (laryngeal fibrosis, dysphagia), both following the schedule with 2.2 Gy per fraction, have been observed so far. Larynx preservation was achieved in 25/26 of the definitively irradiated patients (one underwent a salvage laryngectomy); 23 had no or minimal dysphagia (G0-1)., CONCLUSION: Excellent early disease control and high patient satisfaction with swallowing function in HC following SIB IMRT were observed; these results need to be confirmed based on a longer follow-up period. In order to avoid G4 reactions, SIB doses of < 2.2 Gy/fraction are recommended for large tumors involving laryngeal structures.",Excluded

Here, we report, through in vitro studies and in vivo human pilot clinical studies, the use of inert, inorganic silica-gold nanoshells for the treatment of a widely prevalent and researched, yet poorly treated disease of acne. We use ~ 150 nm silica-gold nanoshells, tuned to absorb near-IR light and near-IR laser irradiation to thermally disrupt overactive sebaceous glands in the skin which define the etiology of acne-related problems. Low-frequency ultrasound was used to facilitate deep glandular penetration of the nanoshells. Upon delivery of the nanoshells into the follicles and glands, followed by wiping of superficial nanoshells from skin surface and exposure of skin to near-infrared laser, nanoshells localized in the follicles absorb light, get heated, and induce focal thermolysis of sebaceous glands. Pilot human clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of ultrasonically-delivered silica-gold nanoshells in inducing photothermal disruption of sebaceous glands without damaging collateral skin.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Denosumab was used in Rheumatology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London from October 2010. Objectives We audited the indications for use of denosumab in these patients. Drug compliance, adverse effect and tolerability of the drug were also analysed. Methods 81 patients (female 77, male 4, age range 52 to 92 years, mean age 72 years) who commenced denosumab between October 2010 and December 2011 were identified retrospectively. 97% (79/81) of the patients come from their own home and 3% (2/81) come from nursing home. Patients' demographics, risk factors, fracture history, bone mineral density (BMD), spine and hip T score and previous osteoporosis treatment were assessed. 58 patients had follow up data and renal function was monitored every six months. Side effects were documented. Results Pre-treatment Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was available on all patients (mean BMD spine and hip 0.686 gm/cm2 and 0.705 gm/cm2, mean T score spine and hip -3.025 and -1.776). 87% (75/81) had failed treatment with both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. 11% (9/81) had breast cancer and were on aromatase inhibitors. 16% (13/81) had mild renal impairment and 7% (6/81) had moderate renal impairment at the base line. 35.8% (29/81) of patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency at baseline and were treated. 9% (7/81) were on denosumab treatment for primary prevention of osteoporosis (T score range -2.3 to -4.1). All of these had failed oral medication previously. Four patients swapped from intravenous Ibandronate due to poor venous access. Use of denosumab was indicated clinically despite lack of specific risk factors suggested by NICE. All patients treated with denosumab for secondary prevention of osteoporosis (91%,74/81) met NICE criteria by virtue of previous fracture and failure of other treatments. Four men were treated off-license. 44% (36/81) had completed six month treatment and 27% (22/81) had completed one year treatment. All these patients were compliant to the drug.

594,"Myocardial infarction mortality risk after treatment for hodgkin disease: A collaborative British cohort study Background Myocardial infarction is a major cause of excess long-term mortality in survivors of Hodgkin disease, but limited information exists on the effects of specific chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients on their risk of death from myocardial infarction. Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded
405,"Efficacy of sucralfate ointment in the prevention of acute proctitis in cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial Background: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a usual adverse effect in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. The symptoms include diarrhea, rectal blood or mucus discharge, fecal urgency and tenesmus with pain. Sucralfate, an aluminum-based salt of sucrose octasulfate, is a cytoprotective agent that forms a coating barrier at injured sites by adhering to mucoproteins. It has been used in topical management of a wide variety of local lesion. This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of rectal sucralfate on acute radiotherapy induced proctitis. Method(s): Seven percent sucralfate ointment was prepared for topical use. Drug quantification, chemical stability and microbial limit tests were performed carefully. In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, fifty-seven patients with pelvic malignancies undergoing radiotherapy were allocated to receive either 1 g of sucralfate or 1 g of placebo, given as a twice daily ointment, one day before and during radiotherapy for six weeks. The eligible patients were evaluated based on RTOG acute toxicity criteria and the following ARP symptoms weekly: Rectal hemorrhage, diarrhea, rectal pain, and fecal urgency. The influence of symptoms on lifestyle was also recorded weekly. Result(s): Acute proctitis was significantly less prevalent in patients in the sucralfate group. The incidence of rectal bleeding (P=0.003), diarrhea (P=0.002), rectal pain (P=<0.001) and fecal urgency (P=0.002) was significantly less common in the sucralfate group. No statistical significant difference was observed for radiotherapy induced cystitis in the placebo and sucralfate groups (P=0.27).

2769,"'A comparative study using conventional concomitant chemoradiotherapy (using cisplatin-based chemotherapy) with accelerated (six fractions a week) chemoradiotherapy in inoperable or nonresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancers:' A prospective randomized trial Context: The conventional concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Accelerated CCRT results in shortening of overall treatment time which can contribute in controlling accelerated tumor repopulation. The increase in tumor control probability (TCP) can be expected with no or little effect on late normal tissue injury for a given total dose. Aim(s): The aim of this study was to compare the disease response, toxicity profile, quality of life (QoL), and overall survival in accelerated versus conventional CCRT. Subjects and Methods: Total 42 patients were randomized into two groups - study group (n = 21): Accelerated CCRT, radiation was given as 6 fractions per week (60 Gy/5 weeks/30#) with injection cisplatin 20 mg/m2intravenous (iv) days 1-5 and days 29-33 + injection etoposide 50 mg/m2iv days 1-5 and days 29-33 and control group (n = 21): Conventional CCRT, radiation was given as 5 fractions per week (60 Gy/6 weeks/30#) along with the same chemotherapy. External beam radiation therapy was delivered by cobalt-60 machines. Result(s): The overall response rate (complete and partial response) for all patients was 66.6%. In the control group, it was 66.2%, and in the study group, it was 66.6%. Grade >=II pulmonary, hematological, and esophageal toxicities were seen in 57%, 43%, and 24% in patients of the control group and 53%, 53%, and 33% in the study group, respectively. In QoL analysis, maximum improvement was noted for hemoptysis, arm/shoulder pain, dyspnea, and chest pain in both the groups. Statistical Analysis Used: The data were analyzed by Student's t-test and Chi-square test. P < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Conclusion(s): As response rates and disease progression were similar in both the groups, accelerated chemoradiotherapy can be considered as an alternate therapy, especially in high-volume centers.Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

Objective(s): We report the effective radiation dose from index and downstream testing in low to intermediate risk symptomatic patients evaluated for chest pain in the ED with either CCTA or usual care to define various sources of patient radiation dose and quantify effective dose over a year and a half of follow-up. Patients and Methods: We evaluated radiation exposure from initial and downstream testing in a prospectively collected, matched cohort evaluated for CP in the emergency department (ED) with either CCTA compared with usual care over a median follow-up of 19.6 months. Effective radiation dose was calculated using published conversion factors. Result(s): Prospective, ECG-triggered acquisition using a 128-slice dual-source multidetector computed tomography (DSCT) scanner was performed in 92.9% of scans with a median effective dose from CCTA of 6.8 mSv (IQR 5.2, 9.1 mSv). CCTA cohort patients were more likely to undergo cardiac testing with exposure to radiation (P < 0.001); however, the median effective dose in patients exposed to radiation from cardiac testing was significantly lower in the CCTA cohort (7.1 mSv vs. 11.8 mSv, P < 0.001). Fewer patients in the CCTA cohort had additional non-cardiac thoracic imaging radiation exposure (40.8%) compared with usual care (92.8%). Total radiation exposure from any source was similar between the CCTA and usual care groups (100% vs 98.4%, P = 0.087), as was median total effective radiation dose (P = 0.105). Upfront CCTA was not associated with higher rates of incidental non-cardiac findings. Conclusion(s): Initial evaluation of acute chest pain in the ED with CCTA was not associated with an increase in total radiation exposure over a follow-up period of 19 months. CCTA offers a more comprehensive evaluation of multiple thoracic organ systems leading to reduced radiation exposure from non-cardiac thoracic testing and no increase in incidental imaging findings. This may represent an added benefit in this population of patients presenting acutely.Copyright © 2015, Iranian Society of Echocardiography.",Excluded
297,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

111,"Long-term observations of radiation-induced creatinine clearance reduction and renal parenchymal volume atrophy PURPOSE: The kidney is a dose-limiting organ for upper abdominal radiotherapy. In this study, radiation-induced kidney injury represented by changes of creatinine clearance (Ccr) and renal parenchymal volume measured by computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by analysing dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PGDLBCL) treated with chemoradiotherapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight PGDLBCL patients (seventy-six kidneys) treated with chemoradiotherapy were included in this study. At least 4 years of follow-up was required for eligibility. Patients underwent (immuno-) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with approximately 40Gy to the whole stomach and perigastric lymph nodes. Ccr and CT were obtained at least annually. Changes of Ccr and renal parenchymal volume before and 4years after radiotherapy were compared using DVH parameters., RESULTS: Mean Ccr decreased significantly from 82.7mL/min (range, 39-124mL/min) before radiotherapy to 70.4mL/min (range, 35-109mL/min) (p=0.01) 4years after radiotherapy. Mean reduction of bilateral renal parenchymal volume was 12% (range, -5-37%) in the same time period. Ccr and renal parenchymal volume tended to lower over time more than 4years after radiotherapy. Concerning DVH analysis, V20Gy26.6% and D30%19Gy had a significant risk of bilateral renal atrophy of 14% and reduction of the Ccr20mL/min., CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a definite relationship between DVH, renal atrophy and Ccr reduction. V20Gy<26.6% and D30%<19Gy appeared to be safe dose constraints for a Ccr reduction of <20mL/min 4years after radiotherapy. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
384,"CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas Objective. Hemangiopericytoma is a rare and aggressive meningeal tumor. Although surgical resection is the standard treatment, hemangiopericytomas often recur with high incidences of metastasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (CK) in the management of recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. Methods. In a review of the Stanford radiosurgery database between 2002 and 2009, the authors found 14 patients who underwent CK therapy for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. A total of 24 tumors were treated and the median patient age was 52 years (range 29-70 years) at the time of initial CK therapy. The median follow-up period was 37 months (10-73 months) and all patients had been previously treated with surgical resection. Mean tumor volume was 9.16 cm3 and the mean marginal and maximum radiosurgical doses to the tumors were 21.2 Gy and 26.8 Gy, respectively. Result(s): Of the 24 tumors treated, 22 have clinical follow-up data at this time. Of those 22 tumors, 12 decreased in size (54.5%), 6 remained unchanged (27.3%), and 4 showed recurrence (18.2%) after CK therapy. Progression-free survival rate was 95%, 71.5%, and 71.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after multiple CK treatments. The 5-year survival rate after CK was 81%. Conclusion(s): CK is an effective and safe management option for hemangiopericytomas. The current series demonstrates a tumor control of 81.8%. Other institutions have demonstrated similar outcomes with stereotactic radiosurgery, with tumor control ranging from 46.4% to 100%. © 2011 Veeravagu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1197,"Chronic bronchitis in the cohort of Mayak workers first employed 1948-1958 Incidence of chronic bronchitis has been studied in a cohort of 12,210 workers first employed at one of the main plants of the Mayak nuclear facility during 1948-1958 and followed up to 31 December 2005. Information on external gamma doses is available for virtually all of these workers; in contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30% of workers. During the follow-up period in the study cohort 1,175 incident cases of chronic bronchitis were verified. The analyses of nonradiation factors revealed that the underlying risk of chronic bronchitis incidence increased with increasing attained age and was higher among smokers compared with never-smokers as would be expected. The most interesting finding in relationship to nonradiation factors was a sharp increase in the baseline chronic bronchitis risk before 1960. The cause of this is not clear but a number of factors may play a role. Based on the follow-up data after 1960, the analysis showed a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with cumulative external gamma-ray dose (ERR/Gy = 0.14, 95% CI 0.01, 0.32). Based on the same subset but with an additional restriction to members with cumulative internal lung dose below 1 Gy, a statistically significant linear dose response relationship with internal alpha-radiation lung dose from incorporated plutonium was found (ERR/Gy = 2.70, 95% CI 1.20, 4.87). In both cases, adjustment was made for nonradiation factors, including smoking and either internal or external dose as appropriate. At present there are no similar incidence studies with which to compare results. However, the most recent data from the atomic bomb survivor cohort (the Life Span Study) showed statistically significant excess mortality risk for respiratory diseases of 22% per Gy and this value is within the confidence bounds of the point estimate of the risk from this study in relation to external dose.",Excluded
93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
2397,"PVP magnetic nanospheres: Biocompatibility, in vitro and in vivo bleomycin release Purpose: To synthesize and characterize a magnetic micromolecular delivery system based on PVP hydrogel with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the crosslinker. Method(s): The microparticles were successfully prepared using 25 kGy Co-60 gamma-ray irradiation and characterized. Biocompatibility, in vitro and in vivo drug release tests were carried out. Results and discussion: Bleomycin was quantitatively released with in slightly over 8 h (hours) from the nanospheres containing 1 mg bleomycin while the time was longer for those containing 5 mg. On the other hand free bleomycin quantitatively passed through the dialysis baffle with in only 3.5 h. For both 5 and 1 mg of bound bleomycin, it took up to 2 h to reach peak concentration compared to 30 min for the free drug. Conclusion(s): The PVP hydrogel magnetic nanospheres exhibited passive drug release that could be exploited to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The present results indicate that PVP hydrogel based magnetic nanospheres have potential as drug carriers in magnetic guided chemotherapeutic drug delivery. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

3060,"The interdependence between clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid gland function, and the anti-hormonal antibodies Background: According to the common notions, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an immunopathological condition with complex autoimmune response, directed presumably to synovial tissue. Besides that, there are some organ involvements in RA, that can strongly affect the extent of the autoimmune reactions. One of this organs is thyroid gland, because changes of its function, either increase or decrease, modulate activity of immune cells and inflammation level on the whole. Production of antibodies, directed to T3 and T4, is a candidate mechanism of the thyroid involvement. Objective(s): The objectives of our study are detection of different thyroid conditions in RA including determination of lesion type and function assessment, as well as searching for interdependence between the clinical features of RA, type of thyroid involvement, and the level of the anti-hormonal antibodies. Method(s): The research was carried out in agreement with the principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1997). Approval for the investigation was got from the Regional Medical Ethics Committee. We enrolled adult patients with RA, verified using ACR/EULAR criteria (2010). RA activity was determined by means of DAS28 index. Thyroid involvement was detected by clinical, ultrasound, and laboratory assessment, including TSH, free T3, free T4, and anti-TPO. Anti-T3 and anti-T4 antibodies were measured using ELISA and calculated in terms of optical density units (ODU). The positive cutoff values, 0.098 ODU for anti-T3 and 0.093 ODU for anti-T4, have been found using healthy controls (n=39). Results were expressed as means+/-standard errors, the differences were considered significant at p<0.05. Result(s): 75 patients with RA have been enrolled, including 61 (81.4%) women and 14 (18.6%) men, their age was from 25 to 78 years. Mean RA activity was 3.2+/-1.4 DAS28 points. Different visceral involvements were detected in 20 (26.7%) cases, and 5 (6.7%) of them had an overt clinical picture of thyroid lesions. The signs and symptoms for 4 of them were similar to Hashimoto's thyroiditis with hyperfunction, the remaining one was complied to the mixed toxic goiter. All these 5 patients had low TSH and quite high DAS28 score (4.8+/-1.9). However, the prevalence of subclinical thyroid disorders in RA was considerably higher. Virtually all the patients (n=73) have been revealed anti-T3 (0.128+/-0.047 ODU) and/or anti-T4 antibodies (0.152+/-0.050 ODU). There was no relationship between these antibodies and organ involvement, other than thyroid gland; RF titers also had no significant influence. We found some rather unexpected dependencies of these markers with X-ray RA stages, as well as with RA activity. There was a clear trend of elevation of mean anti-T4 concentration together with higher Steinbrocker stage (p=0.034, ANOVA), the inverse tendency have been observed for anti-T3 (p=0.047, ANOVA). Correlations of DAS28 score with anti-T4 (r=0.525, p=0.031) and anti-T3 (r=-0.391, p=0.040) were also opposite. There was another significant inverse correlation of DAS28 score and TSH concentration (r=-0.330, p=0.046). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that though anti-T4 concentration is tended to be elevated, high RA activity can promote hyperthyroidism. This is probably due to either influence of these antibodies to T4 and T3 production, or immune disturbances caused by thyroid hyperfunction itself.",Excluded
2994,"Downregulation of MicroRNA-330 Correlates with the Radiation Sensitivity and Prognosis of Patients with Brain Metastasis from Lung Cancer BACKGROUND: The present study sought to explore the role of microRNA-330 (miR-330) in predicting the radiation response and prognosis of patients with brain metastasis (BM) from lung cancer (LC)., METHODS: Patients with BM from LC were identified and classified into radiation-sensitive and radiation-resistant groups according to the overall survival rate, local and distant recurrence rate after conventional whole-brain radiation therapy. Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-330 expression in serum. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-330 for the radiation sensitivity of brain metastasis from LC. Related clinical factors for radiation sensitivity were assessed by logistic regression analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted using COX regression and the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: MiR-330 exhibited lower expression in the radiation-sensitive group than in the radiation-resistant group. The area under the ROC curve of miR-330 for predicting radiation sensitivity was 0.898 (optimal cut-off value, 0.815), with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 90.1%. After radiation therapy, patients with low miR-330 expression, compared to patients with high miR-330 expression, displayed a lower survival rate and a median survival time. MiR-330 expression was correlated with extracranial metastasis, maximum BM diameter, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and node (N) stage. Logistic regression and COX regression analyses revealed that extracranial metastasis, TNM stage, N stage and miR-330 expression were factors that influenced both radiation sensitivity and individual prognostic factors in patients with BM from LC., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the downregulation of miR-330 correlates with radiation sensitivity and poor prognosis in patients with BM from LC.

672,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded
66,"Occipitocervical fixation in the management of craniocervical instabilities Introduction: The occipitocervical junction presents a unique, complex, biomechanical interface between the cranium and the upper cervical spine. Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity. A comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the occipital-cervical junction is imperative. A wide variety of stabilization techniques and instrumentation systems are currently available, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. © 2011.",Excluded
2577,"3D deep learning angiography (3D-DLA) from C-arm Conebeam CT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULT(S): Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSION(S): Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology.

1488,"Comparison of ultrasound-assisted and pure fluoroscopy-guided extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy for renal stones Background: In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and clinical outcomes of shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) for patients with renal stones using pure fluoroscopy (FS) or ultrasound-assisted (USa) localization with two lithotripters. Method(s): We retrospectively identified 425 patients with renal calculi who underwent SWL with either a LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter (209 cases), which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting or a Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter machine (216 cases), which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking. The patient demographic data, stone-free rates, stone disintegration rates, retreatment rates and complication rates were analyzed. Result(s): The USa group had a significantly higher overall stone-free rate (43.6 vs. 28.2%, p < 0.001) and stone disintegration rate (85.6 vs. 64.3%, p < 0.001), as well as a significantly lower retreatment rate (14.8 vs. 35.6%, p < 0.001) and complication rate (1.9 vs. 5.5%, p = 0.031) compared with the FS group. This superiority remained significant in the stone size < 1 cm stratified group. In the stone size > 1 cm group, the stone-free rate (32.4 vs. 17.8%, p = 0.028), disintegration rate (89.2 vs. 54.8%, p = 0.031) and retreatment rate (21.6 vs. 53.4%, p < 0.001) were still significantly better in the USa group, however there was no significant difference in the complication rate. The most common complication was post-SWL-related flank pain. Conclusion(s): SWL is a safe and non-invasive way of treating renal stones. This study compared two electromagnetic shock wave machines with different stone tracking systems. LiteMed LM-9200 ELMA lithotripter, which combined ultrasound and fluoroscopic stone targeting outperformed Medispec EM-1000 lithotripter, which used fluoroscopy for stone localization and tracking, with better stone-free rates and disintegration rates, as well as lower retreatment rates and complications with possible reduced radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
1734,"Low-dose high-dose-rate brachytherapy in the treatment of facial lesions of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma Background: The use of many of the standard skin-directed mycosis fungoides (MF) therapies on facial skin may be limited by site-specific increased risks of side effects, excessive inflammation, and ocular toxicity. Objective(s): Our study aimed to describe the levels of erythema, scale, and induration of facial lesions in MF before and after low-dose high-dose-rate surface applicator brachytherapy and to examine the overall clinical response to brachytherapy.

225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded
74,"The Impact of Dose Rate on DNA Double-Strand Break Formation and Repair in Human Lymphocytes Exposed to Fast Neutron Irradiation The lack of information on how biological systems respond to low-dose and low dose-rate exposures makes it difficult to accurately assess the carcinogenic risks. This is of critical importance to space radiation, which remains a serious concern for long-term manned space exploration. In this study, the gamma-H2AX foci assay was used to follow DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair following exposure to neutron irradiation, which is produced as secondary radiation in the space environment. Human lymphocytes were exposed to high dose-rate (HDR: 0.400 Gy/min) and low dose-rate (LDR: 0.015 Gy/min) p(66)/Be(40) neutrons. DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included
2370,"Effect of early risedronate treatment on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation: A prospective single-center study The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of risedronate (RIS) on bone loss and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis within the first month after LT were randomized to receive RIS 35 mg/week plus calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D3 800 IU/day (n = 45) or calcium and vitamin D3 at same dosages (n = 44). Primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) 6 and 12 months after LT. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (P1NP) and fracture rate. Spine X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. There was no significant difference in BMD changes between both treatment groups at any sites; either at 6 or 12 months. Spine BMD increased in both groups at 12 months vs. baseline (P = 0.001). RIS patients had a significant increase in intertrochanteric BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Serum beta-CTX decreased in both groups (P < 0.01), with significant differences between groups at 3 months. No significant difference in vertebral fracture incidence was found. After 12 months, BMD improved at lumbar spine and did not change at hip in both groups. Significant differences between both groups were not found. Other factors (calcium and vitamin D replacement, early prednisone withdrawal) seem to have also positive effects in BMD. © 2011 The Authors Transplant International © 2011 European Society for Organ Transplantation.",Excluded
819,"Role of aortic calcification, stiffness and wave reflections in cardiovascular risk in dialysis patients: Baseline data from the CORD study Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Method(s): Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Result(s): Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.",Excluded
2418,"Kinetic Imaging in Lower Extremity Arteriography: Comparison to Digital Subtraction Angiography Purpose To compare the image quality produced by kinetic imaging in x-ray angiography and the current reference standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Materials and Methods This prospective observational crossover study enrolled 42 patients undergoing lower limb x-ray angiography between February and June 2017 (mean age, 68.7 years; age range, 49-89 years; 32 men [mean age, 67.1 years; age range, 49-89 years] and 10 women [mean age, 75 years; age range, 57-85 years]). Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of DSA and kinetic image pairs were compared. Visual quality comparisons were also performed by specialists who used an online questionnaire. Interrater agreement was characterized by percent agreement and Fleiss k. Results A total of 1902 regions of interest were carefully selected in 110 image pairs to calculate and compare the SNRs. Median SNR in raw kinetic images was 3.3-fold and 2.3-fold higher than raw and postprocessed DSA images, respectively. A total of 232 pairs of raw and postprocessed kinetic images were compared. It was indicated that postprocessing improved the quality of kinetic images in 63.9% (2668 of 4176) of the comparisons. Interrater agreement was 75% and Fleiss k was 0.12 (P < .001). Also, 238 pairs of kinetic and DSA images were compared. Kinetic imaging was judged to have provided higher quality images than DSA in 69.0% (2462 of 3570) of the comparisons. The interrater agreement was 81% and Fleiss k was 0.17 (P < .001). Conclusion Kinetic imaging helps to view the same structures as digital subtraction angiography but offers better image quality. The improved signal-to-noise ratio suggests that this approach could reduce radiation exposure and improve the ability to view smaller vessels. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
678,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded

990,"Decrease of respiratory burst in neutrophils of patients with ankylosing spondylitis by combined radon-hyperthermia treatment OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils, the total anti-oxidative status of plasma, and the parameters of systemic inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) before and after a combined radon-hyperthermia treatment in the thermal tunnels of Bockstein-Bad Gastein in Austria., METHODS: In 20 patients with AS the effects of a total of 15 hours of radon-hyperthermia-treatment spread over a period of three weeks were studied. The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included
3273,"Co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound images through image-based device tracking OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of automated co-registration of angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to facilitate integration of these two imaging modalities in a synchronous manner., BACKGROUND: IVUS provides cross-sectional imaging of coronary arteries but lacks overview of the vascular territory provided by angiography. Co-registration of angiography and IVUS would increase utility of IVUS in the clinical setting., METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients undergoing surveillance for cardiac allograft vasculopathy with angiography and IVUS of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were enrolled. A pre-IVUS angiogram of the LAD was performed followed by an ECG-triggered fluoroscopy (ECGTF) during IVUS pullback at 0.5 mm/s using an automatic pullback device. ECGTF was used to track the IVUS catheter during pullback and establish a spatial relationship to the pre-IVUS angiogram. Angio-IVUS co-registration was performed with a research prototype (Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and accuracy was evaluated by distance mismatch between angiography and IVUS images at vessel bifurcations., RESULTS: Median age was 54 (44.5, 67) years. The population was 82.6% male with minimal risk factors. The median (IQR) co-registration distance mismatch measured at 108 bifurcations in 42 (85%) patients was 0.35 (0.00-1.16) mm. Seven patients were excluded due to inappropriate data acquisition (n = 3) and failure of tracking (n = 4), e.g., due to overlapping sternal wires. Estimated effective radiation dose for ECGTF was 0.09 mSv., CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of angio-IVUS co-registration which may be used as a clinical tool for localizing IVUS cross-sections along an angiographic roadmap. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

513,"Options for the modified radiation weighting factor of neutrons The recent ICRP Report 92 has noted that the current radiation weighting factor, wR, depends on the energy of the incident neutrons in a manner that differs substantially from the dependence, which results from the current convention, QL. At all neutron energies, but most conspicuously below 1 MeV, the values of wR exceed those of the effective quality factor, qE. The discrepancy is largely due to the fact that--in the absence of computed values of the effective quality factor for neutrons--wR has been patterned after the values of the ambient quality factor, which accounts insufficiently for the low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma ray component from neutron capture in the human body. There are different options to remove the discrepancy. Option 1 is to reduce wR substantially at all neutron energies to make it equal to qE for a standard condition, such as isotropic incidence of the neutrons. Since such a reduction may cause problems in those countries where the current wR values are already legally implemented, ICRP 92 has proposed what is here termed Option 2. It recommended to replace QL by the increased value 1.6 QL - 0.6 and, accordingly, to make the radiation weighting factor equal to 1.6 qE - 0.6. With Option 2 the radiation weighting factor needs to be decreased appreciably at low neutron energies, but for fission neutron spectra the overall changes are minor. To guide--regardless which option is chosen--the selection of the numerical values, the effective quality factor, qE, is computed here for different directional distributions of neutrons incident on the anthropomorphic phantoms ADAM and EVA. None of the sex averaged numerical values is found to deviate much from those for isotropic incidence. Isotropic incidence can, thus, be used as an adequate standard condition. A numerical approximation is proposed for the standard qE that is nearly equivalent to a formula invoked by ICRP 92, but is somewhat simpler and provides realistic values of qE even for the extremely high neutron energies in space. In line with ICRP 92, it is emphasised that wR needs to be seen as a derived quantity related to the LET-dependent weighting factor. Copyright 2004 Oxford University Press",Excluded
828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded
141,"Quality of Life, Behaviour and Attitudes towards Actinic Keratosis in Spain: The PIQA Study OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to examine patients' knowledge, behaviours and attitudes regarding actinic keratosis (AK) lesions and the impact of the disease on patients' quality of life (QoL)., METHODS: Observational study of patients with AK lesions in Spain. QoL was evaluated with the validated version of Spanish AKQoL questionnaire. Skin self-examination, sun-exposure, habits and attitudes towards AK's treatment were recorded using different questionnaires. The adherence was assessed by means of the Morisky-Green test. Among other variables, QoL and adherence to treatment were compared by using Pearson's chi2 test and one-way ANOVA tests. Inferential analysis regarding such factors and length of treatment were also performed., RESULTS: A total of 1240 patients (73.6 [10.5] years old) were recruited. Overall, patients that showed higher levels of concern were also showed a higher impairment on QoL. AK had greater effects on women's QoL and those who performed skin self-examination, think that AK is a disease and/or believe that moisturizers can prevent skin aging (P<.05). Adherence and length of treatment were strongly related, since patients with treatments intended for <1week were more likely to show good adherence and complete remission of AK (Odds Ratio [95%CI]: 6.25 [4.55-8.33] and 2.63 [1.96-3.45]), respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Concerns due to AK are mainly related to sex and to the consideration of AK as a disease. More concerned patients tend to have lower QoL and good adherence to treatment. Short length of treatment was associated with better adherence and complete remission of AK lesions.

The study aimed to ascertain the success of Astra-Tech implants in this patient group. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients who were restored with Astra Tech implants after ablative head and neck surgery were evaluated by analyzing serial prospectively accrued data since April 2006. Patient's data who received implants in the mandible were selected to be evaluated regarding implant success and contributing factors. Implant survival was calcula ted by the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Stat-View Version 4.1, Abacus Concepts, Inc.) and Cox models were used to evaluate any association between implant failure and reconstructive or medical treatment modality. Result(s): A total of 136 implants were placed in 33 patients during December 2006 to April 2012. Ten of the subjects were females and 23 were males with a mean age of 65 years. 21 patients received radiotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose between 56 Gray and 76 Gray. In six patients failures were noted resulting in a loss of 17 implants. Cumulative survival rates were 92.7% after 1 year and 87.5% after years two and three. Radiation therapy contributed to 12 of the 17 implant failures (p-value < 0.3). Failures occurred more in the interforam inal than in the posterior region (11-6). Free vascularized bone grafts with two failure fared significantly better than own bone or free bone grafts (p-value < 0.344). Conclusion(s): Astra Tech implant survival is acceptably high in this at risk group of patients and compares more than favorably with comparative studies in the literature. Radiation therapy seems to be associated with implant failure and the contribution of vascular-ized tissue to the survival of implants seems to be significant.",Excluded
2067,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk BACKGROUND: DNA strand breaks pose the greatest threat to genomic stability. Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included
1512,"Validation of a Dose Assessment Method to be Used in 18F FDG Loose Contamination Exercises ABSTRACT: Radiological emergency response may require responders to operate in contaminated environments. To provide more realistic training to these individuals, it has been proposed to disperse low amounts of short-lived radioactive material in simulated emergency scenarios. To demonstrate the applicability and safety of such activities, a limited exercise was conducted where 18F was sprayed in a small area and survey activities were executed. A pre-job external radiation exposure dose assessment was performed in preparation for this training. The research presented here compares participant external recorded doses to assessment results in order to validate the dose estimates. Two individuals were used during the dispersion, search, and survey activities. First, a radiation worker mixed 200 MBq Fludeoxyglucose 18F with 470 mL H2O in a weed sprayer and distributed it over a 3 m x 3 m area. After evaporation, an exercise participant performed search and survey activities in the area. Actual whole-body doses measured with optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters were 10 +/- 1 muSv for both personnel. Whole-body digital dosimeters read 4.3 +/- 0.2 muSv and 3.3 +/- 0.5 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. Actual extremity doses were below the dosimeters' minimum detectable limits for the radiation worker (thermoluminescence dosimeter) and exercise participant (optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter). The dose assessment-predicted whole-body doses were 2.8 +/- 0.4 muSv and 3.2 +/- 0.1 muSv for the radiation worker and exercise participant, respectively. The estimated dose to the radiation worker's hand was 21.8 +/- 3.8 muSv, and the estimated dose to the exercise participant's knee was 13.4 +/- 0.6 muSv. The study provided substantial evidence for the validity of the dose assessment method, supporting its use for a larger training exercise.Copyright © 2021 Health Physics Society.",Excluded
2088,"Low-dose semi-coronal CT of the sacroiliac joints in the early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis Background: Imaging modalities are essential for the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Radiographic sacroiliitis is the requirement of 1984 modified New York (mNY) criteria for AS but with the disadvantage of low sensitivity. MRI has the advantage of detecting active inflammatory lesions but was criticized for low specificity. Computerized tomography (CT) has higher diagnostic accuracy than radiography in detecting structural changes, but its application has been limited for high radiation dose. The reduction of radiation dose can be achieved by decreasing the tube current[1] and previous study has demonstrated that effective dose (ED) of semi-coronal sacroiliac joint (SIJ) CT is at least six times lower in female or nearly four times lower in male than that of axial SIJ CT[2]. Objective(s): To evaluate the value of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT in the early diagnosis of AS. Method(s): Thirty-three patients diagnosed by mNY criteria who had pre-existing axial SIJ CT in past two years with visible structural damage were enrolled. These patients underwent low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT examination which was obtained at 3-mm slices, 140 kV and 120 mAs, with the gantry tilted 20-25degree cranially. The ED of the low-dose semi-coronal CT and the pre-existing conventional axial CT were compared. Image qualities of the low-dose semicoronal CT were blind-graded separately by 2 rheumatologists into poor, fair, good or excellent. And the correlation between image quality and body mass index (BMI) was analyzed. The CT scans were read in a blinded manner by 2 rheumatologists who had been trained by radiologists. CT scans of the two groups were graded respectively by mNY criteria, the criteria established by Lee[3] and the Innsbruck criteria[4]. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the consistency of grading between the two groups. Result(s): Thirty-three patients received low-dose semi-coronal CT examination with an average ED of 3.37 mSv, which meant a 49% reduction in radiation compared to the pre-existing CT. The quality of images of male patients with BMI<25 kg/m2 and all female patients were good or excellent. Image qualities were assessed as poor or fair in 58% (7/12) male patients whose BMI>25 kg/m2. There was a significant negative correlation between image quality and BMI (r=-0.784,P=0.000). The grading of low-dose semi-coronal CT showed no differences as compared with the pre-existing CT by mNY criteria (see below). For the other two classification criteria, the consistency of grading between the two groups were satisfactory (kappa=0.897 by Lee criteria; kappa=0.814 by Innsbruck criteria; P>0.05). Conclusion(s): The radiation dose of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT was reduced significantly compared with the conventional axial SIJ CT with acceptable diagnostic efficacy.

1256,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included

In F2 and F3, a decrease in frequency was observed. Most likely, the cytogenetic effects observed were caused by environmental contamination with plutonium in the locality of capture. An increased chromosomal instability observed in the first laboratory generation of nonirradiated common voles was caused by reversible modifications in the expression of mutator genes inherited from parents exposed to alpha-irradiation rather than by classic mutations occurred in specific loci.",Included
1633,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

2918,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
759,"Changes in symptom clusters in patients undergoing radiation therapy GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT. The majority of the symptom cluster severity scores were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with prostate cancer.""",Included
851,"The effect of chronic low-level exposure on hair damages of radiation workers According to chronic exposure of radiation workers during their work experience,this study was an attempt to assess the damage caused by radiation on the hair of radiation workers. In this study the total Skin and Hair Analyzing System capable of registering polarized images was used for measuring hair parameters (hair thickness,hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil). Hair management software ,Skin Management Software and also 150X,700X lenses were used to measure the hair parameters. The study included one questionnaire which it's face validity and content validity was approved by pilot study and some professional experts. The participants were 152 hospital personnel and were divided into radiation exposed group (radiotherapy technicians,nuclear medicine technicians) and control group (nurses) and were homogenized based on age,work situation,work time,work experience and baldness (family history). Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers. The reason may be inadequate training of technologists and their high workload.Copyright © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.",Included
2286,"Use of routine thoracic and abdominal computed tomography scans for assessing bone mineral density and detecting osteoporosis OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of computed tomography (CT) attenuation measurements for assessing bone mineral density (BMD) and predicting osteoporosis in thoracic and abdominal CT scans for various clinical indications using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as reference standard., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 234 patients (147 women, 87 men) undergoing DXA and CT were examined retrospectively. Mean time between both studies was 0.5 years. CT-attenuation values in Hounsfield units (HU) were measured at the thoracic and lumbar spine (T1, T6, T12, L1-L5), at the femoral neck, and then assigned to their corresponding DXA scores., RESULTS: Patients with DXA-defined osteoporosis or osteopenia showed significantly lower HU values of trabecular bone at all measured levels compared to healthy subjects (p < 0.001). HU values were highest at T1 and T6, lowest at L1-L3 and the femoral neck. There were no significant intraindividual differences between HU values in the sagittal, coronal or transversal plane. Significant differences between normal and abnormal BMD categories were verified for three CT scanners. More than half of all fractures were detected in patients with non-osteoporotic DXA T-scores., CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal and particularly thoracic CT scans obtained for other clinical indications can sensibly be applied toward determining low BMD, detecting osteoporosis and identifying persons at increased fracture risk. Osteoporotic morbidity and mortality might be minimized. Superiorly to DXA, fragility fractures can be found without additional imaging or radiation exposure which can initiate early adequate treatment., LIMITATIONS: Key limitations of the study were as following: a retrospective, single-center study; small patient cohort - larger cohorts are needed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic performance measurements; more complex CT evaluation of the hip for BMD assessment; DXA measurements were used as a reference standard, however, patients with unsuspected compression fractures but showing osteopenic or even normal BMD outline the limitations of DXA.",Excluded

1041,"Assessment of pulmonary 18F-FDG-PET uptake and cytokine profiles in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and erlotinib Purpose To investigate effects of radiotherapy (RT) and erlotinib on pulmonary glucose uptake using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during and after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to identify associations between serum cytokine levels and lung glucose uptake. Material and methods Twenty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC, receiving RT alone or concomitant RT and erlotinib therapy, were examined by 18F-FDG PET before, during, and after treatment. A total of 57 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed. Pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake and radiotherapy dose mapping were used to acquire dose-response curves for each patient, where subsequent linear regression gave a glucose uptake level in the un-irradiated parts of the lungs (SUV0) and a response slope (DELTASUV). Serum cytokine levels at corresponding time points were assessed using a multiplex bioassay. Correlations between the most robust cytokines and lung 18F-FDG dose response parameters were further investigated. Results From the dose response analysis, SUV0 at post-therapy was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than at mid- and pre-therapy (45% and 58%, respectively) for the group receiving RT + erlotinib. Also, SUV0 at post-therapy was higher for patients receiving RT + erlotinib compared to RT alone (42%; P < 0.001). No differences in DELTASUV were seen with treatments or time. SUV0 was positively associated (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) with serum levels of the chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) for patients receiving RT + erlotinib. Conclusions Concomitant RT and erlotinib causes an elevation in pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake post treatment compared to RT alone. Pulmonary glucose uptake is associated with an upregulation of a chemokine (CCL21) involved in inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded
2931,"Clinical and radiological manifestations of pleural effusion at the UMAE No. 34, Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico Introduction: Many benign and malignant diseases can cause pleural effusion. Symptoms depend on the amount of accumulated fluid and the underlying cause. Imaging studies are useful in the detection and management of pleural effusions. Objective(s): To determine the radiological characteristics of pleural effusion and its relationship with clinical and biochemical manifestations and histological markers. Method(s): From March 2011 to March 2012, an observational, descriptive, prolective analytical study was performed. Chest X-rays of 138 patients > 15 years of age with pleural effusion during the study period were reviewed. Radiological studies were interpreted by three pulmonologists blinded to the underlying pathology (kappa. 95). We used the statistical package SPSS 19.0. Statistical significance was considered when p value was < 0.05. Result(s): The mean age of the study group was 56.1 +/- 15.8 years; 93 (67.4%) were males. The most common signs and symptoms regardless of the etiology were dyspnea, 108 cases (78.2%) (p = 0.033); cough, 96 (69.5%); weight loss, 82 (59.4%) (p = 0.042); and pain, 79 (57.2%). The most common X-ray pattern was massive effusion in 46 (33%) followed by loculated effusion in 33 (24%). There was a unilateral predominance in 119 (86%) patients, with greater frequency in those with infectious (p = 0.012) and neoplastic etiology (p = 0.006). Conclusion(s): Clinical and radiological manifestations of pleural effusion are varied according to the type of pleural pathology and the degree of involvement.Copyright © 2014, Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias.

1497,"Onsite versus offsite radiation treatment of malignant spinal cord compression: Lessons from a safety net health system Objective: Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is an oncologic emergency that often warrants emergent treatment; but, it is unclear whether radiation treatment (RT) can be optimally managed from an offsite radiotherapy facility. Method(s): Patient charts from consecutive patients with MSCC who were treated with radiotherapy alone at either an onsite hospital radiation department (from 2008 to 2012) or an offsite radiotherapy centre (2012-2015) were reviewed. Patient clinical parameters were compared across groups with either the chi2 test or Fisher's exact test, while survival curves were compared with the log-rank test. The primary end points were ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): A total of 45 patients were identified, with 19 patients treated onsite in the hospital department and 26 patients treated at the offsite radiotherapy centre with median follow-up of 42 days vs 48.5 days, respectively. The ambulatory rate over time, overall survival and cancer-specific survival were not significantly different between the two eras. Patients treated in-hospital were more likely to start treatment the same day as the consult (""sim and treat"") (79% vs 27%, p = 0.006) and were more likely to not complete treatment (26% vs 4%, p = 0.029) as compared with those treated in the offsite centre. Conclusion(s): Patients with MSCC can be feasibly treated at an offsite radiotherapy centre with outcomes similar to those treated in-hospital.

975,"Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of gamma-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory (trained immunity"") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited. Copyright © Society for Leukocyte Biology.""",Excluded
2570,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included

246,"3D histomorphometric quantification of trabecular bones by computed microtomography using synchrotron radiation Conventional bone histomorphometry is an important method for quantitative evaluation of bone microstructure. X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved. The results obtained could be used in forming the basis for comparison of the bone microarchitecture and can be a valuable tool for predicting bone fragility. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

996,"Detection of pancreatic tumors, image quality, and radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase: effect of a low-tube-voltage, high-tube-current CT technique--preliminary results PURPOSE: To intraindividually compare a low-tube-voltage (80 kVp), high-tube-current (675 mA) computed tomographic (CT) technique with a high-tube-voltage (140 kVp) CT protocol for the detection of pancreatic tumors, image quality, and radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, single-center, HIPAA-compliant study was approved by the institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained. Twenty-seven patients (nine men, 18 women; mean age, 64 years) with 23 solitary pancreatic tumors underwent dual-energy CT. Two imaging protocols were used: 140 kVp and 385 mA (protocol A) and 80 kVp and 675 mA (protocol B). For both protocols, the following variables were compared during the pancreatic parenchymal phase: contrast enhancement for the aorta, the pancreas, and the portal vein; pancreas-to-tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR); noise; and effective dose. Two blinded, independent readers qualitatively scored the two data sets for tumor detection and image quality. Random-effect analysis of variance tests were used to compare differences between the two protocols., RESULTS: Compared with protocol A, protocol B yielded significantly higher contrast enhancement for the aorta (508.6 HU vs 221.5 HU, respectively), pancreas (151.2 HU vs 67.0 HU), and portal vein (189.7 HU vs 87.3 HU), along with a greater pancreas-to-tumor CNR (8.1 vs 5.9) (P < .001 for all comparisons). No statistically significant difference in tumor detection was observed between the two protocols. Although standard deviation of image noise increased with protocol B (11.5 HU vs 18.6 HU), this protocol significantly reduced the effective dose (from 18.5 to 5.1 mSv; P < .001)., CONCLUSION: A low-tube-voltage, high-tube-current CT technique has the potential to improve the enhancement of the pancreas and peripancreatic vasculature, improve tumor conspicuity, and reduce patient radiation dose during the pancreatic parenchymal phase.",Excluded
2044,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included

Coronary artery segments were assessed for image quality and significant luminal diameter narrowing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and accuracy of both CTCA groups were determined using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) as reference standard. Radiation dose values were calculated., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding gender, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, severity of CAD, mean heart rate, heart rate variability, and Agatston score (all p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of non-assessable coronary segments between group 1 (1.6%, 24/1404) and group 2 (1.4%, 19/1385; p=0.77); non-diagnostic image quality was significantly (p<0.001) more often attributed to stair step artifacts in group 1. Segment-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 98%, 98%, 88%, 100%, and 100% among group 1; 96%, 99%, 90%, 100%, and 98% among group 2, respectively. Parameters of diagnostic performance were similar (all p>0.05). Mean effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (2.2+/-0.4 mSv) was significantly (p<0.0001) smaller than that of retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA (8.1+/-0.6 mSv)., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-gated CTCA yields similar image quality, performs as accurately as retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA in patients having heart rates <=70 bpm while being associated with a lower mean effective radiation dose.

99,"Splinting the degenerative basal joint: Custom-made or prefabricated neoprene? The purpose of this study was to compare the objective, subjective, and radiographic responses of patients with carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (CMCJ-OA) wearing a prefabricated neoprene splint (PFN), which crosses the CMCJ and metacarpophalangeal joint, with those of patients wearing a custom-made thermoplastic short opponens splint (CMT), which crosses only the CMCJ. Patients (N = 25) with first CMCJ stage I and II osteoarthritis were assigned randomly to wear either the PFN splint or the CMT splint for one week. After one week, the subjects rated their function in the splint and their satisfaction and pain levels on visual analogue scales. Pinch measurements were performed and x-rays were taken to assess carpometacarpal subluxation. The second splint was then applied for one week and all measures were repeated. The subjects rated the PFN splint significantly higher, and most reported that they would choose the PFN splint over the CMT splint for daily and long-term use. Both pain and function were improved with splinting, but the effect was amplified with the PFN splint compared with the CMT splint. Both splints reduced subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint, but the CMT effect was greater. This study further supports current evidence that subjects with stage I and II first CMCJ-OA will have pain relief with thumb splinting. In addition, the PFN splint will provide greater relief when compared with the CMT splint. Furthermore, this study reveals that patients prefer the PFN splint to the CMT splint.",Excluded

Illumination with visible light after fertilization (10-70 min after insemination) showed the existence of photoreactivation (PR), demonstrating that pyrimidine dimers are a lesion in sperm DNA that is mainly responsible for the UV-caused Hertwig effect. Genetic analysis, in which sperm from a wild-type of this fish was used, showed that, after UV-irradiation at the high dose range, male nuclei did not participate in embryonic development (a gynogenetic haploid condition). Embryos having only a maternal set of chromosomes could develop no further than stage 27.

The objective of the current study was to analyze and investigate the average patient received dose from axial and spiral CT exams in a medical imaging center. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, the patient imaging technique, weight and height were recorded. The patients' doses provided by CT unit in terms of CTDIw were also recorded. Then, other dosimetric quantities including dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose were calculated for each patient using the recorded data. The average values were obtained for all the studied dosimetric quantities. Also, their distribution in terms of examined regions and imaging mode; ie, axial and spiral CT were analyzed by SPSS software. Result(s): For all patients, the mean effective dose of 4.4 mGy with the standard deviation of 9.2 was found. The CTDIw for axial group was two times higher than spiral ones. Conversely, the effective dose of axial group was less than spiral group. Additionally, the effective doses of 2.3 and 5.2 mSv were found for axial and spiral, receptively. For both quantities of CTDIw and effective dose, the observed difference between axial and spiral modes were significant (P<0.001).

1701,"Molecular and cellular profiling of acute responses to total body radiation exposure in ovariectomized female cynomolgus macaques Purpose: The threat of radiation exposure requires a mechanistic understanding of radiation-induced immune injury and recovery. The study objective was to evaluate responses to ionizing radiation in ovariectomized (surgically post-menopausal) female cynomolgus macaques. Material(s) and Method(s): Animals received a single total-body irradiation (TBI) exposure at doses of 0, 2 or 5 Gy with scheduled necropsies at 5 days, 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-exposure. Blood and lymphoid tissues were evaluated for morphologic, cellular, and molecular responses. Result(s): Irradiated animals developed symptoms of acute hematopoietic syndrome, and reductions in thymus weight, thymopoiesis, and bone marrow cellularity. Acute, transient increases in plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) were observed in 5 Gy animals along with dose-dependent alterations in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) signatures in thymus, spleen, and lymph node. Expression of T cell markers was lower in thymus and spleen, while expression of macrophage marker CD68 (cluster of differentiation 68) was relatively elevated in lymphoid tissues from irradiated animals.

261,"Temporal trends of fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization in coronary chronic total occlusion revascularization: insights from a multicenter United States registry BACKGROUND: The impact of operator experience on fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) has received limited study., METHODS: We evaluated temporal trends in fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization among 1,363 consecutive CTO PCIs performed at three US institutions between January 2006 and November 2011., RESULTS: Mean age was 65 +/- 11 years, 85% of patients were men, 40% had diabetes, 37% had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and 42% had prior PCI. The CTO target vessel was the right coronary artery (55%), circumflex (23%), left anterior descending artery (21%), and left main or bypass graft (1%). The retrograde approach was used in 34% of all procedures. The technical and procedural success rates were 85.5 and 84.2%, respectively. The mean procedural time, fluoroscopy time, and contrast utilization were 113 +/- 61 min, 42 +/- 29 min, and 294 +/- 158 mL, respectively. Years since initiation of CTO PCI were independently associated with higher technical success rate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52-1.70, P < 0.001), lower fluoroscopy time (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.95, P = 0.005), and contrast utilization (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.62-0.79, P < 0.001) during the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Among selected US-based institutions performing CTO PCI, we observed a significant reduction in total fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization paralleled with an improved technical success rate over time.

319,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1 Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s): Subjects were 373 asymptomatic individuals who performed both low-dose chest CT and abdominal fat CT for medical check-up. Maximum bi-dimensional axial diameters of paracardial fats at right (RPF) and left (LPF) cardiophrenic angle portions, and epicardial fats around right (REF) and left (LEF) coronary arteries, and coronary sinus (SEF) were measured. Correlation between pericardial fat diameters and metabolic parameters were statistically analyzed. Result(s): RPF, LPF, REF, LEF, and SEF diameters were moderately correlated with abdominal visceral fat (AVF) area (R = 0.74, 0.70, 0.48, 0.41, and 0.53, respectively, p < 0.01) in Pearson's correlation analysis. In multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient of RPF for AVF showed highest value. Means of each PF and EF diameters in subjects with metabolic syndrome were significantly larger than those without metabolic syndrome (p < 0.001). All PF and EF diameters were well-discriminated for prediction of metabolic syndrome in ROC analysis (AUC values, from 0.696 to 0.795). Conclusion(s): RPF diameter at low-dose chest CT would be a simple method for prediction of metabolic syndrome.Copyright © 2018, Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
910,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study INTRODUCTION: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included

Aim/Introduction: To determine the value of systematically performing whole-body (head-to-toe) PET/CT images (WBPET) in the evaluation of patients with malignant melanoma and propose a criteria of when standard imaging can be performed. Material(s) and Method(s): Retrospective study of all WB-PET scans performed in patients with malignant melanoma in our hospital, either for staging, restaging, recurrence or post-treatment follow-up, between January 2011 and January 2020. We looked for any FDG avid foci in the lower extremities. The findings were considered as true positives if histopathological findings were confirmed, if the lesion was treated as melanoma because of other complementary findings (physical exploration, ultrasound, etc) or if during follow-up it was determined as malignant in nature. We also analyzed if the true positive findings had any change in patients management. Result(s): We analyzed 367 WB-PET studies belonging to 169 patients, 93 male (55%) and 76 female (45%), with a mean age of 56.4 years (range 19-90 years). Of the 367 studies performed 170 (46,3%) where for staging (all at least stage IIIB), and 197 (53,7%) for suspected recurrence or post treatment follow-up. From all the WB-PET scans we observed that 19 (5 %) had positive findings in the lower extremities, 11 (3%) of which were true-positive findings (all with histopathological confirmation), 8 (2%) scans were false positive (5 inflammatory foci demonstrated by clinical follow-up and 3 benign lesions (dermatophibroma, nevus and encondroma). From the 11 true-positive findings, 8 (2%) had the primary lesion in an infra-umbilical location; 1 (0.2%) was an extracutaneous melanoma (paranasal) but the finding could be included on a standard study, and the other 2(0,4%), had disseminated disease so the findings did not change clinical management. Also, none of these findings generated a change in management. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, we found that WB-PET in patients with melanoma had no additional value to standard (head-tomid-thigh) PET/CT images. We propose to perform WB-PET only in patients with the primary melanoma lesion located below the umbilical line.

Patients and Methods: The schedule consisted of a first phase of chemotherapy alone and a second phase of concurrent chemoradiation. Initial doses were: docetaxel and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus 5-FU 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 29-49; RT (40 Gy) started on day 29. In the following steps the doses were escalated up to docetaxel 35 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57 plus 5-FU 180 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 29-63 concurrently with RT 50 Gy. Result(s): Forty-seven patients were enrolled and 46 completed the planned treatment. During the concomitant phase, grade 3-4 hematological toxicities occurred in three patients (6.5%) (or 3/174 cycles) and non-hematological toxicities in six patients (13%) (or 7/179 cycles). A pathological downstaging was obtained in 59.6% of the cases (28/47): complete remission (pCR) in 14 patients, near pCR (residual microfoci on the primary pN0) in eight patients, pT2 pN0 in three patients and partial response on the primary with positive lymph nodes in three patients. Six (13%) and 13 (28%) patients were considered stable and non-responders, respectively. In the last dose level, eight pCR and four near-pCR were obtained out of 15 patients. The maximum tolerable dose was not formally defined because dose escalation was stopped at the last dose level. Conclusion(s): This schedule represents a feasible treatment and the high pathological response rate is extremely encouraging; the doses found in the last dose-level are the basis for an ongoing phase II study at our institution. © 2005 European Society for Medical Oncology.",Excluded
588,"Validation of a decision instrument for selective chest imaging in blunt trauma IMPORTANCE Chest radiography (chest x-ray [CXR] and chest computed tomography [CT]) is the most common imaging in blunt trauma evaluation. Unnecessary trauma imaging leads to greater costs, emergency department time, and patient exposure to ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVE To validate our previously derived decision instrument (NEXUS Chest) for identification of blunt trauma patients with very low risk of thoracic injury seen on chest imaging (TICI).We hypothesized that NEXUS Chest would have high sensitivity (>98%) for the prediction of TICI and TICI with major clinical significance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 2009 to January 2012, we enrolled blunt trauma patients older than 14 years who received chest radiography in this prospective, observational, diagnostic decision instrument study at 9 US level I trauma centers. Prior to viewing radiographic results, physicians recorded the presence or absence of the NEXUS Chest 7 clinical criteria (age >60 years, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, abnormal alertness/mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness to chest wall palpation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thoracic injury seen on chest imagingwas defined as pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, and pulmonary contusion or laceration seen on radiographs. An expert panel generated an a priori classification of clinically major, minor, and insignificant TICIs according to associated management changes. RESULTS Of 9905 enrolled patients, 43.1%had a single CXR, 42.0% had CXR and chest CT, 6.7%had CXR and abdominal CT (without chest CT), 5.5%had multiple CXRs without CT, and 2.6%had chest CT alone in the emergency department. The most common trauma mechanisms were motorized vehicle crash (43.9%), fall (27.5%), pedestrian struck by motorized vehicle (10.7%), bicycle crash (6.3%), and struck by blunt object, fists, or kicked (5.8%). Thoracic injury seen on chest imaging was seen in 1478 (14.9%) patients with 363 (24.6%) of these having major clinical significance, 1079 (73.0%) minor clinical significance, and 36 (2.4%) no clinical significance. NEXUS Chest had a sensitivity of 98.8% (95%CI, 98.1%-99.3%), a negative predictive value of 98.5%(95%CI, 97.6%.6-99.1%), and a specificity of 13.3%(95%CI, 12.6%-14.1%) for TICI. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for TICI with clinically major injury were 99.7%(95%CI, 98.2%-100.0%) and 99.9% (95%CI, 99.4%-100.0%), respectively.

942,"Assessing the Association Between Electrical Stimulation Dose, Subsequent Cognitive Function and Depression Severity in Patients Receiving Bilateral Electroconvulsive Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between electrical stimulation administered to patients undergoing bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and subsequent measures of cognitive function and depression severity., METHODS: Stimulus dose titrated patients receiving bilateral ECT were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Spatial Recognition Memory test and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline, after 4 ECT treatments and on course completion. Changes in CANTAB and MADRS scores were assessed in relation to electrical dosage, initial stimulus dose, and demographic variables using linear mixed models., RESULTS: Data pertained to 143 patients (mean age, 56.85 [SD, 14.94], 43% male). Median change in CANTAB score was -10% (-20% to 5%) after 4 ECT treatments and -10% (-20% to 5%) at course completion. Median change in MADRS score was -22 (-33 to -13) after 4 ECT treatments and -14 (-25 to -7) at course completion. Electrical dosage had no effect on CANTAB or MADRS change scores either after 4 treatments or course completion. Improvement in CANTAB score at end of course was associated with female sex (P < 0.05), higher intelligence quotient (P = 0.01), and age. After 4 treatments, improvement in CANTAB score was associated with younger age (P < 0.001) and higher intelligence quotient (P < 0.01). Improved MADRS score at course completion was associated with older age (P < 0.001 at end of course and after 4 treatments)., CONCLUSIONS: Electroconvulsive therapy has significant antidepressant and cognitive effects which are not associated with the total electrical dose administered. Other, unalterable variables, such as age and sex, have an influence on these effects.",Excluded
2175,"Does exposure to static magnetic fields generated by magnetic resonance imaging scanners raise safety problems for personnel? MRI workers are occupationally exposed to static and time-varying gradient magnetic fields. While the 24-hour time-averaged exposure to static magnetic fields is about a few mT, the maximum static field strength can be as high as 500 mT during patient setup. Over the past several years, our laboratory has performed extensive experiments on the health effects of exposure of animal models and humans to different sources of electromagnetic fields such as cellular phones, mobile base stations, mobile phone jammers, laptop computers, radars, dentistry cavitrons and MRI. This study is to investigate the adverse health effects in MRI workers and also to assess the effect of exposure of MRI workers to static magnetic fields on their cognitive functions. In the first phase of this study a questionnaire was designed to collect information from 120 MRI personnel. The collection of data about the adverse health effects was based on self-reporting by the participants. In the second phase, 47 volunteer university students were asked to continuously move around a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Visual reaction time and working memory tests were performed on all participants before and after the experiment. Forward digit span and backward digit span were used for assessing the working memory. Furthermore, participants were asked to report the symptoms they had experienced during the movement. The first phase of our study showed increased frequencies of adverse health effects in MRI workers. In this study the rates of self-reported symptoms such as a headache, sleep problems, myalgia, palpitation, fatigue, concentration problems, attention problems, nervousness and backpain were possibly affected by static magnetic field. Furthermore we found that reaction time and working memory could be influenced by the movements of the body around a MRI scanner. It can be concluded that movement through a high magnetic field can also lead to some adverse cognitive effects in MRI staff.Copyright © 2018, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

2535,"A study on radiation dose received by patients during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Background: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is considered as the method of choice for treatment of most stone diseases. The present study aims to evaluate radiation dose received by patients undergoing ESWL. Method(s): In total, 46 patients from both genders were referred to the Shohadaye Ashayer hospital of Khorramabad, Iran and were included in the present study. Patients were positioned in anteroposterior (AP) projection and along 30degree anterior oblique (AO) projection upon the X-ray fluoroscopy table and exposures were conducted. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used for radiation dose measurements. To evaluate the entrance surface dose (ESD), each TLD chip was taped on back of patient at the entrance surfaces of the X-ray beam. Result(s): The mean number of stones in each patient was 1.4. The stone sizes ranged from 7 to 29 mm, and a mean of 3200 pulses were need for each patient. The mean ESD in the postero-anterior (PA) and oblique X-ray beam entrance were obtained at 12.04 and 68.84 mGy, respectively. There was linear correlation between patient dose with fluoroscopy time, tube current (mA), tube potential (kVp) and patient position (P < 0.001); however, we found no strong correlation between patient dose with patient body mass (P = 0.837), number of shock wave pulses (P = 0.089), stone size (P = 0.773) and locations (P = 0.463). Conclusion(s): The data obtained in the current study are comparable with information available in the literature. They emphasized that ESWL exposes patients to much more radiation compared to those from conventional radiography and is in the range of computed tomography (CT) procedures.

3288,"[Optimizing dosage in thoracic computerized tomography] Radiation exposure in computed tomography (CT) by far exceeds radiation dose in chest radiography. Dose requirements in CT of the chest, however, are much smaller than for the abdomen because of low x-ray absorption in the lungs. This article describes scanner parameters that influence patient exposure and image quality. Suitable compromises will be explained that allow for dose reduction in chest CT without jeopardising image quality. Dose reduction in chest CT should be performed depending on the clinical indication and requires active reduction of mAs settings. For helical CT, a pitch of 1.5 to 2 should be employed. Dedicated low-dose techniques for screening of bronchogenic carcinoma are described. Dose reduction decreases image quality but the detrimental effects can be reduced by applying proper parameters for scanning and image reconstruction. Thus, images of the mediastinum should be reconstructed with a smoothing filter, while a higher resolution filter should be used for the lungs. In multislice CT, reconstruction of thicker axial or multiplanar sections retains spatial resolution but keeps image noise and thus dose requirements low. The effective, weighted CT dose index (CTDIw,eff) can serve as a rough estimate of the effective patient dose (E) in helical or multislice CT of the whole chest: for most scanners and age groups the conversion factors are 0.5 mSv/mGy for females and 0.4 mSv/mGy for males.",Excluded
555,"Chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection: an experience with 22 patients The authors present their experience of chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection in 22 patients. The patients are from a series of 80 patients treated by chest wall resection from 1967 to 1989. Whether performed on breasts still in place, for recurrent disease, or for radiation-induced lesions (which are often associated), the defect created by complete resection of the chest wall layers causes difficulties. Large cutaneous flaps, often including the opposite breast were used at the beginning of the series. Then came omentum associated to Mersilene mesh and myocutaneous flaps. The results, in terms of comfort and local control are acceptable, even though surgery is only palliative for cancer patients. We feel that full thickness chest wall resection is the only effective treatment for some primary and recurrent malignant tumors and for extensive thoracic radionecroses. Such procedures are designed to improve the patient's quality of life even if they do not actually prolong survival. The goals guiding the reconstruction programme are: (1) the restoration of a stable parietal rigidity; and (2) the reconstruction of long lasting superficial layers.",Excluded

2856,"Feasibility of wide detector CT perfusion imaging performed during routine staging and restaging of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of CT perfusion performed during routine multiphase contrast-enhanced CT on a 160 mm wide-coverage 256-slice scanner in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Method(s): Fifty-seven patients had a CT perfusion acquisition during their routine multiphase CT. Perfusion was performed 5 to 42.5 s (15 passes at 2.5 s intervals) after intravenous contrast administration (4.2-5 ml/s), followed by pancreatic parenchymal and portal venous phases for clinical interpretation. Perfusion maps were generated and blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability surface area product (PS) for tumor and uninvolved pancreas were calculated using deconvolution algorithms and compared to existing similar publications. Radiation dose information was recorded and size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) was calculated using body dimensions. Result(s): Diagnostic quality of standard images was unaffected by performing the perfusion acquisition. Average tumor center BF was 20.8 +/- 12.1 ml/100 g/min, BV 2.5 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g and PS 15.5 +/- 39.4 ml/100 g/min. Average pancreas BF was 90.8 +/- 50.2 ml/100 g/min, BV 11.9 +/- 4.3 ml/100 g and PS 33.6 +/- 27.7 ml/100 g/min. For the perfusion acquisition, mean SSDE was 57 +/- 11 mGy, CTDIvol 43 +/- 6 mGy and DLP 685 +/- 100 mGy-cm. Conclusion(s): Adding a perfusion CT acquisition to standard pancreatic CT protocol is feasible using a wide-detector 256-slice CT scanner and adds quantitative information while maintaining diagnostic quality of the standard of care examination. This novel protocol adds no time or cost to the examination and yields perfusion parameters that are comparable to existing literature using a separate dedicated perfusion protocol.

3255,"Optimization of 64-MDCT urography: Effect of dual-phase imaging with furosemide on collecting system opacification and radiation dose OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare opacification of the urinary collecting system and radiation dose associated with three-phase 64-MDCT urographic protocols and those associated with a split-bolus dual-phase protocol including furosemide. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Images from 150 CT urographic examinations performed with three scanning protocols were retrospectively evaluated. Group A consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a three-phase protocol with saline infusion. Group B consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a reduced-radiation three-phase protocol with saline. Group C consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a dual-phase split-bolus protocol that included a low-dose furosemide injection. Opacification of the urinary collecting system was evaluated with segmental binary scoring. Contrast artifacts were evaluated, and radiation doses were recorded. Results were compared by analysis of variance. RESULTS. A significant reduction in mean effective radiation dose was found between groups A and B (p < 0.001) and between groups B and C (p < 0.001), resulting in 65% reduction between groups A and C (p < 0.001). This reduction did not significantly affect opacification score in any of the 12 urinary segments (p = 0.079). In addition, dense contrast artifacts overlying the renal parenchyma observed with the three-phase protocols (groups A and B) were avoided with the dual-phase protocol (group C) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. A dual-phase protocol with furosemide injection is the preferable technique for CT urography. In comparison with commonly used three-phase protocols, the dualphase protocol significantly reduces radiation exposure dose without reduction in image quality. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1584,"Regional radiation dose susceptibility within the parotid gland: Effects on salivary loss and recovery Purpose: Xerostomia is one of the most likely late toxic effects of radiotherapy treatment in patients with head-and-neck cancers. Modern treatment techniques can incorporate knowledge of complication risk into treatment plans. To this end, the authors attempt to quantify the regional radiotherapy dose-dependence of salivary output loss and recovery in a prospective study. Method(s): Salivary output was collected from patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment for headand- neck cancers at the BC Cancer Agency between February 2008 and May 2013. Regional dose-dependence (i.e., dose susceptibility) of loss and recovery is quantified using nonparametric (Spearmans rank correlation coefficients, local linear regression) and parametric (least-sum of squares, least-median of squares) techniques. Result(s): Salivary flow recovery was seen in 79 of 102 patients considered (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon sign rank test). Output loss was strongly correlated with left- and right parotid combined dose phi = min (DL, 45 Gy)+min (DR, 45 Gy), and can be accurately predicted. Median early loss (three months) was 72% of baseline, while median overall loss (1 yr) was 56% of baseline. Fitting an exponential model to whole parotid yields dose sensitivities A3m = 0.0604 Gy?1 and A1y = 0.0379 Gy?1. Recovery was not significantly associated with dose. Hints of lateral organ subsegment doseresponse dimorphism were observed. Conclusion(s): Sub-segmentation appears to predict neither loss nor recovery with any greater precision than whole parotid mean dose, though it is not any worse. Sparing the parotid to a combined dose phi of <50 Gy is recommended for a patient to keep =40% of baseline function and thus avoid severe xerostomia at 12 months post-treatment. It seems unlikely that a populations mean recovery will exceed 20%30% of baseline output at 1 yr after radiotherapy treatment using current (whole-organ based) clinical guidelines.Copyright © 2015 Am.

831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

3174,"Validation of a New Method for 2D Fusion Imaging Registration in a System Prepared Only for 3D Purpose: To validate a new 2D-3D registration method of fusion imaging during aortic repair in a system prepared only for 3D-3D registration and to compare radiation doses and accuracy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study involved 189 patients, including 94 patients (median age 70 years; 85 men) who underwent abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with 2D-3D fusion on an Artis zee imaging system and 95 EVAR patients (median age 70 years; 81 men) from a prior study who had 3D-3D registration done using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT). For the 2D-3D registration, an offline CBCT of the empty operating table was imported into the intraoperative dataset and superimposed on the preoperative computed tomography angiogram (CTA). Then 2 intraoperative single-frame 2D images of the skeleton were aligned with the patient's skeleton on the preoperative CTA to complete the registration process. A digital subtraction angiogram was done to correct any misalignment of the aortic CTA volume. Values are given as the median [interquartile range (IQR) Q1, Q3]. Result(s): The 2D-3D registration had an accuracy of 4.0 mm (IQR 3.0, 5.0) after bone matching compared with the final correction with DSA (78% within 5 mm). By applying the 2D-3D protocol the radiation exposure (dose area product) from the registration of the fusion image was significantly reduced compared with the 3D-3D registration [1.12 Gy.cm2 (IQR 0.41, 2.14) vs 43.4 Gy.cm2 (IQR 37.1, 49.0), respectively; p<0.001). Conclusion(s): The new 2D-3D registration protocol based on 2 single-frame images avoids an intraoperative CBCT and can be used for fusion imaging registration in a system originally designed for 3D-3D only. This 2D-3D registration protocol is accurate and leads to a significant reduction in radiation exposure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
2232,"Derivation and validation of the Asian ureteral stent length guide Background and objectives Choice of stent length remains subjective despite the maturity of the procedure and incorrect stent length adversely affects quality of life. We aim to determine the ureteral length of the Malaysian population using CT measurement and to derive an ideal stent length guide based on body height. Materials and methods Phase-1 enrolled 118 patients. Bilateral ureteral lengths were measured by CT scan from the level of the renal vein to VUJ. They were grouped according to body height and median length for each were obtained. Phase-2 was a prospective randomisedtrial involving 60 patients undergoing ureteral stenting. 6F Double-J stents were used and choice of length in Group A was based on the devised guide; and using intraoperative ureteral length measurement with 5F catheter in Group B. Fluoroscopy time was recorded. Intravesical position of stent was determined by postoperative X-ray. USSQ score, were analysed two-weeks postoperatively. Results The median right and left ureteral length for male patients were 20.9 cm (18-27) and 21.3 cm (17-27); for female patients they were 20.7 cm (16-24) and 22.0 (17-25) respectively. Phase one concluded that double-J stents of 22 cm in length were suitable for all but men >=170 cm and women >=160 cm where a 24 cm stent is more appropriate. In Phase-2, median age was 49 (17-71) and median height of male and female patients were 165 cm (152-175) and 149 cm (140- 172) respectively. Fluoroscopy time is significantly shorter in Group A (3.03 vs 6.43 s, P = 0.001) and incidence of the distal loop crossing the midline was lower (0 vs 11, P < 0.001). Total USSQ score was better in Group A (60 vs 83, P = 0.001) particularly in urinary symptoms (P = 0.004) and pain (P < 0.001) subdomains. Stent migration was not encountered in both groups. Conclusion The devised ideal ureteral stent length guide for Malaysian adults is reliable, reduces procedural fluoroscopy time and curtails the incidence of post-procedural stent-related symptoms.",Excluded

A large amount of data indicates a relationship between mesothelioma and asbestos exposure. The incidence has both considerably and constantly increased over the past 2 decades in the industrialized countries and is expected to peak in 2010-2020. In Italy, a standardized-rate incidence in 2002 among men was 2.98 per 100,000 and 0.98 per 100,000 among women, with wide differences from one region to another. Stage diagnosis and definition may be difficult. Management of patients with MPM remains complex, so an optimal treatment strategy has not yet been clearly defined.

The enrolled COVID-19 infected patients were from Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital (17 cases, Wuhan, China), Suzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (87 cases, Suzhou, China), and Xuzhou Infectious Disease Hospital (14 cases, Xuzhou, China). After admission, basic information was collected; X-ray and chest CT images were obtained; and data from routine blood tests, liver and kidney function, myocardial enzymes, electrolytes, blood coagulation function, (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, procalcitonin (PCT), calcitonin, and other laboratory tests were obtained. The patients were grouped according to the clinical classification method based on the pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection (trial version 7) in China. The measurements from mild (56 cases) and severe cases (51 cases) were compared and analyzed. Most COVID-19 patients presented with fever. Chest X-ray and CT images showed multiple patchy and ground glass opacities in the lungs of COVID 19 infected patients, especially in patients with severe cases. Compared with patients with mild infection, patients with severe infection were older (p = 0.023) and had a significant increase in AST and BUN. The levels of CK, LDH, CK-MB, proBNP, and Myo in patients with severe COVID-19 infection were also increased significantly compared to those in patients with mild cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 infections presented coagulation dysfunction and increased D-dimer and fibrin degradation product (FDP) levels. Severe COVID-19 patients had low serum calcium ion (Ca2+) concentrations and high calcitonin and PCT levels and exhibited serious systemic inflammation. Ca2+ in COVID-19 patients was significantly negatively correlated with PCT, calcitonin, D-dimer, PFDP, ESR, CRP and IL-6. D-dimer in COVID-19 patients was a significantly positively correlated with CRP and IL-6. In conclusion, patients with severe COVID-19 infection presented significant metabolic dysfunction and abnormal blood coagulation, a sharp increase in inflammatory factors and calcitonin and procalcitonin levels, and a significant decrease in Ca2+. Decreased Ca2+ and coagulation dysfunction in COVID-19 patients were significantly correlated with each other and with inflammatory factors.© Copyright © 2021 Qi, Kong, Ding, Wu, Ji, Huang, Li, Wang, Wen, Wu, Wu, Huang, Li, Liu and Tang.",Excluded

711,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three radiologists retrospectively reviewed the pretreatment x-ray angiographic and MR angiographic studies obtained in 30 consecutive patients: 15 patients (15 limbs) evaluated for limb salvage and 15 patients (20 limbs) evaluated because of claudication. MR angiography included acquisition of 2D contrast-enhanced MR digital subtraction angiograms of the area from the adductor canal to the feet and 3D spoiled gradient-recalled-echo bolus chase MR angiograms obtained in three stations from the aorta to the middle portion of the calf. Each reader reviewed the x-ray and MR angiograms to determine the inflow and outflow segments for a hypothetical bypass graft placement. RESULT(S): The three readers selected identical segments for inflow at MR angiography and x-ray angiography in 32, 32, and 35 of the 35 limbs evaluated (mean percentages of agreement [95% Cl]: 91% [77%, 98%], 91% [77%, 98%], and 95% [90%, 100%], respectively).

2664,"A randomized study comparing the use of a pelvic lead shield during trans-radial interventions: Threefold decrease in radiation to the operator but double exposure to the patient OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of a 0.5-mm lead apron across the patient's abdomen in addition to standard operator protection for the reduction of scatter radiation on operator and patient radiation exposure, BACKGROUND: Cardiac angiography using the radial access compared to the femoral approach is associated with reduced complication rate and improved patient comfort but has significantly increased radiation dose. Improvements in radiation protection are needed, METHODS: We randomly assigned 332 patients undergoing coronary angiography to a group with pelvic lead shielding and a group with standard protection. In each procedure, eight digital dosimeters were used to measure operator radiation dose [under the lead apron, outside the thyroid shield, and at the left side of the head], patient dose at the level of the umbilicus [above and beneath the lead apron], and two on the acrylic shielding and one on the image receptor to measure scattered radiation, RESULTS: Both groups were similar in BMI, procedures performed, and number of sequences. Usage of lead shielding statistically significantly reduced the radiation dose of the operator at all three sites measured: under lead apron [all in microSv]: 0.53 +/- 1.4 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.6, on thyroid collar 5.9 +/- 7.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 3.4, and left side of head 3.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.2, P<0.001. However the radiation to the patient was doubled from 15.4 +/- 24.1 to 28.9 +/- 81.1, P=0.04 CONCLUSIONS: The use of a pelvic lead shield during radial angiography reduced the operator radiation exposure at multiple measurement sites. However there was an increased exposure to the patient. This balance should be further investigated before the widespread adoption of this method. . Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

1998,"Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer causes prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency PURPOSE: A worsened anorectal function after chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer is often attributed to radiation damage of the anorectum and pelvic floor. Its impact on pudendal nerve function is unclear. This prospective study evaluated the short-term effect of preoperative combined chemoradiation on anorectal physiologic and pudendal nerve function. METHOD(S): Sixty-six patients (39 men, 27 women) with localized resectable (T3, T4, or N1) rectal cancer were included in the study. All patients received 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m2/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/day) concurrently on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin within 6 cm of the anal verge had the anus included in the field of radiotherapy (Group A, n = 26). Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin 6 to 12 cm from the anal verge had shielding of the anus during radiotherapy (Group B, n = 40). The Wexner continence score, anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency were assessed at baseline and four weeks after completion of chemoradiation. RESULT(S): The median Wexner score deteriorated significantly (P < 0.0001) from 0 to 2.5 for both Groups A (range, 0-8) and B (range, 0-14). The maximum resting anal pressures were unchanged after chemoradiation. The maximum squeeze anal pressures were reduced (mean = 166.5-157.5 mmHg) after chemoradiation. This change was similar in both Groups A and B. Eighteen patients (Group A = 7, Group B = 11) developed prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency after chemoradiation. These 18 patients similarly had a worsened median Wexner continence score (range, 0-3) and maximum squeeze anal pressures (mean = 165.5-144 mmHg). The results obtained were independent of tumor response to chemoradiation. CONCLUSION(S): Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer carries a significant risk of pudendal neuropathy, which might contribute to the incidence of fecal incontinence after restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer. © The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons 2005.",Excluded

948,"Point-of-care ultrasound for confirmation of gastrostomy tube replacement in the pediatric emergency department Gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) are frequently used in children for feeding and nutrition. Complications related to G-tubes (and G-buttons) in children represent a common presentation to the emergency department (ED). G-tube replacement is usually performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians. Misplacement may lead to tract disruption, perforation, fistula tract formation, or feeding into the peritoneum. Contrast-enhanced radiographs are traditionally used for confirmation. In addition to a longer length-of-stay, repeat ED visits result in repeated radiation exposure. The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) instead of radiography avoids this exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we describe three patients who presented with G-tube complications in whom POCUS alone performed by pediatricians was used for confirmation of the tubes' replacement. Two children presented to the ED with G-tube dislodgement, and one child presented with a ruptured balloon. In all three cases, a new G-tube was replaced at the bedside using POCUS guidance without the need for further radiographic studies. There were no known ED or clinic returns for G-tube complaints over the next 30 days. This is the first report of pediatricians using POCUS to guide and confirm G-tube replacement in children.

Purpose(s): To study effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the complex treatment of acute pancreatitis. Material(s) and Method(s): 120 patients with AP had complex treatment. They were mostly men (102) aged 20 40 years (65%); the rest were 18 women older than 40 (15%). Alcoholic genesis dominated over biliary and alimentary one. In the main group (60 patients) traditional therapy was added with intravenous laser blood irradiation (ILBI). Semiconductor laser ""Mulat"" (output power 5 mW, wavelength 0.635 mm, exposure 40 min) was used for this. Patients from the main group had 8 10 ILBI sessions combined with antioxidant therapy. If the exudation in the omental bursa was up to 5 ml, transcutaneous combined laser irradiation with lasers ""Milta-F"" and ""Mustang-2000"" was done. Points at the pancreas head projection as well as points at the pancreas body and tail projections were irradiation with the techniques developed by the authors. Result(s): Comparative assessment of treatment effectiveness was made using findings of standard clinical, ultrasound and laboratory examinations showing levels of malonic dialdehyde, carbonyls, antioxidant activity SH groups and middle molecules. Due to anti-inflammatory and POL-inhibiting (peroxide lipid oxidation) effects of laser and antioxidant therapy clinical AP manifestations in the main group were eradicated 7.1+/-0.2 days earlier, size and parenchyma echogenity were normalized 5.9+/-0.4 days earlier than in patients from the control group (60 patients) who had traditional treatment. Biochemical indexes got normalized 5.1+/-0.8 days earlier than in the main group; in the controls it was seen only on the 14th day. Combined application of LLLT and antioxidant therapy potentiated effects of each method due to which normalization of POL indexes (malonic dialdehyde, carbonyls, antioxidant activity SH groups) and middle molecules took place 8.3+/-0.5 days earlier than in traditional therapyConclusion: Thus, our findings have shown that complex treatment with LLLT and basic traditional pathogenetic therapy accelerates eradication of pathological process in the pancreas, reduces levels of complications and increases speed of recovery.",Excluded

The authors of this report examined their experience in treating patients with advanced/multiply recurrent TGCT with a combination of surgery and external-beam radiotherapy. METHOD(S): Fifty patients who were treated for TGCT with radiotherapy and surgery from 1972 to 2006 were identified. Patient demographics, radiotherapy treatment parameters, surgical treatment, and oncologic and functional outcomes were evaluated. All patients had pathologic review at presentation and required at least 1 year follow-up. RESULT(S): Forty-nine patients had diffuse TGCT with both intra-articular and extra-articular disease (1 had malignant TGCT). Twenty-eight patients (56%) were referred after at least 1 local recurrence. Thirty patients (60%) underwent at least 2 operations before radiotherapy. The mean dose of radiation delivered was 39.8 gray. At a mean follow-up of 94 months (range, 19-330 months), 47 patients (94%) had not developed a recurrence or had stable disease/signal characteristics on serial cross-sectional imaging (for those patients who had gross residual disease at the time of radiotherapy). Two patients required subsequent total hip arthroplasty because of progressive osteoarthritis, and there were 4 cases of avascular necrosis (only 1 post-Treatment). Forty-one patients had good/excellent function.

2445,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae may cause dyspnoea and hospitalisations in young healthy adults Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) from the respiratory tract has become widely available, but the interpretation of the results remains unclear. M. pneumoniae has been suggested to cause mainly mild and self-limiting infections or asymptomatic carriage. However, systematic analyses of the association between PCR results and clinical findings are scarce. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of PCR-positive M. pneumoniae infections in a hospital setting. We reviewed 103 PCR-positive patients cared for in a university hospital during a 3-year period. Data on age, sex, health condition, acute symptoms, other pathogens found, laboratory and X-ray results and treatments were collected. Over 85% of the patients had a triad of typical symptoms: fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract were rare. In 91% of the cases, M. pneumoniae was the only pathogen found. The highest incidence was found in the age group of 30-40 years, and 68% of the patients did not have any underlying diseases. Most patients were initially empirically treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and needed 2-4 changes in their treatment. Only 6% were discharged without an antibiotic effective against M. pneumoniae. This study shows that M. pneumoniae often led to hospitalisation and that patients needed appropriate antimicrobial treatment to recover. Mixed infections were rare, and situations that could be interpreted as carriage did not occur.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
1974,"Assessment of successful incorporation of cages after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with [(18)F]fluoride positron-emission tomography/computed tomography The purpose of this study is to assess the successful incorporation of cages in patients after cervical or lumbar intercorporal fusion with positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Twenty patients (14 female and 6 male; mean age 58 years, age range 38-73 years) with 30 cervical (n = 13) or lumbar (n = 17) intercorporal fusions were prospectively enrolled in this study. Time interval between last intercorporal intervention and PET/CT ranged from 2 to 116 months (mean 63; median 77 months). IRB approval was obtained for all patients, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. About 30 min prior to PET/CT scanning, 97-217 MBq (mean 161 MBq) 18F-fluoride were administered intravenously. Patients were imaged in supine position on a combined PET/CT system (Discovery RX/STE, 16/64 slice CT, GE Healthcare). 3D-PET emission data were acquired for 1.5 and 2 min/bed position, respectively, and reconstructed by a fully 3D iterative algorithm (VUE Point HD) using low-dose CT data for attenuation correction. A dedicated diagnostic thin-slice CT was optionally acquired covering the fused region. Areas of increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages were determined by one double-board certified radiologist/nuclear physician and one board certified radiologist in consensus. In 12/20 (60%) patients, increased 18F-fluoride uptake around cages was observed. Of the 30 intercorporal fusions, 15 (50%) showed increased 18F-fluoride uptake. Median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in cages with increased uptake was 37 months (2-116 months), median time between intervention and PET/CT examination in those cages without increased uptake was 91 months (19-112 months), p (Wilcoxon) = 0.01 (one-sided). 14/29 (48%) cages with a time interval > 1 year between intervention and PET/CT scan showed an increased uptake. In conclusion, PET/CT frequently shows increased 18F-fluoride uptake in cervical and lumbar cages older than 1 year (up to almost 8 years in cervical cages and 10 years in lumbar cages) possibly indicating unsuccessful fusion due to increased stress/microinstability. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Excluded
1569,"Dexamethasone for the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases: a pilot study PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of dexamethasone as a prophylactic adjuvant analgesic to decrease pain flare and to assess its safety and tolerance of dexamethasone., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients treated with a single 8 Gy for bone metastases took 8 mg dexamethasone before the radiation treatment. The Brief Pain Inventory was administered at baseline and then daily for 10 days after radiation. Pain flare was defined as a two-point increase in the worst pain or a 25% increase in the analgesic intake when compared with the baseline., RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (23 males, 10 females) had complete follow-up data. Their median age was 73 years old. Ten patients had progressive worsening pain during the entire 10-day follow-up. A total of eight patients (24%; 95% CI, 10-39%) experienced pain flare during the 10-day follow-up. Two patients had a 1-day pain flare on day 3. Three patients had a 1-day pain flare on day 7. Three other patients had a prolonged pain flare: one had a 3-day pain flare on days 2-4, one had a 3-day pain flare on days 4-6, and the other, a 6-day pain flare on days 3-8. The half-life of dexamethasone is 36-54 h. Only one patient (3%) experienced pain flare in the first 2 days of follow-up with the action of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone was well tolerated., CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone might be effective in the prophylaxis of radiation-induced pain flare after palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases.

2973,"HOPE for Rational Statin Allocation for Primary Prevention: A Coronary Artery Calcium Picture Is Worth 1000 Words Allocation of statin therapy for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in borderline- and intermediate-risk patients has traditionally been based on population-based global risk assessment and other clinical and laboratory characteristics. Patient-specific treatment decisions are needed to provide maximal benefit and avoid unnecessary treatment. Guideline-based lipid management proposes that coronary artery calcium scoring is reasonable to implement in patients with a 10-year risk of 5.0% to 19.9% (borderline to intermediate risk) by using the pooled cohort equations when the decision about whether to initiate statin therapy is uncertain. We report data from both observational studies and a large primary prevention randomized controlled trial that support the position that this decision is, in fact, uncertain in about half of such patients because of risk misclassification. Such misclassification can be largely avoided by more widespread implementation of coronary calcium scoring, which helps to identify those with coronary artery calcium scores of 0, a finding associated with a less than 5.0% 10-year probability of an ASCVD event. Deferral of statin therapy in such patients, in the absence of smoking, diabetes, or a family history of premature ASCVD, provides more individualized and appropriate care and avoids the expense and potential adverse effects of statin therapy in those with low potential for absolute risk reduction. A rationale is also provided for the importance of coronary artery calcium scoring in women 50 years and older, possibly in place of 1 screening mammogram in women at least 55 years of age to avoid incremental radiation exposure, on the basis of the substantially higher lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality from ASCVD than from breast cancer. In patients with borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk, coronary artery calcium scoring should be used, whenever possible, as an aid to rational statin allocation for the primary prevention of ASCVD.

The number and locus of intestinal metaplasia in the gastric region induced by 2,000 rads of X-ray were greater in the male than in the female. Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones. Therefore, it is likely that male sex hormones are promoting while female sex hormones are inhibiting the development of intestinal metaplasia.",Included

Quantitative comparison was made by calculating the mean SSDE, CTDIvol, contrast, noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both acquisitions. Two radiologists evaluated the chest SECT and DECT images qualitatively blinded to the technique used. The paired Student's t test was utilized for comparing the quantitative and qualitative data. Inter- and intraobserver agreement were also assessed., RESULTS: A total of 42 patients were included. The mean SSDE, CTDIvol, contrast, noise, CNR, and SNR for SECT versus DECT were 12.7+/-2.2 mGy vs. 9.3+/-1.2 mGy (P = 0.001), 10.9+/-2.4 mGy vs. 8+/-1.2 mGy (P < 0.001), 211.9+/-44.7 vs. 216.3+/-59 (P = 0.350), 12.9+/-2.4 vs. 13.9+/-3.7 (P = 0.086), 13.5+/-5.2 vs. 13.3+/-8.4 (P = 0.548) and 12+/-3.5 vs. 11.5+/-3.4 (P = 0.774), respectively.

All studies were performed with a co-infusion of amino acids for renal protection. PET and SPECT were reconstructed using iterative algorithms, incorporating attenuation and scatter corrections. Tissue uptakes (IA%) were measured and used to calculate residence times. Absorbed doses to tissues were estimated and the maximal allowed activity, defined as either the activity delivering 23 Gy to the kidneys (MAA(K)) or 2 Gy to the red marrow (MAA(RM)), was calculated and the resulting tumour absorbed doses were computed., RESULTS: For the MAA(K) the mean absorbed dose to the red marrow was lower for (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide than for (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide (1.8+/-0.9 Gy vs. 6.4+/-1.6 Gy; P<0.001). The median absorbed dose to tumours for the MAA(K) was two-fold higher for (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide as compared to (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide (30.1 vs. 12.6 Gy; P<0.05). The median absorbed dose to tumours estimated for the MAA(RM) was 10-fold higher for (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide than for (111)In-DTPA-D-Phe(1)-octreotide (35.1 Gy vs. 3.9 Gy; P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This direct intra-patient comparison confirms that the use of (90)Y-DOTA-D-Phe(1)-Tyr(3)-octreotide is more appropriate for therapy of somatostatin receptor bearing tumours.

2396,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included

476,"Increased radiation from Chernobyl decreases the expression of red colouration in natural populations of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) Pheomelanin is a pink to red version of melanin pigment deposited in skin and hair. Due to its bright colour, pheomelanin plays a crucial function in signalling, in particular sexual signalling. However, production of pheomelanin, as opposed to its dark alternative, eumelanin, bears costs in terms of consumption of antioxidants important for protection of DNA against naturally produced reactive oxidative species. Therefore, decreased expression of pheomelanin is expected in organisms exposed to severe oxidative stress such as that caused by exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. We tested if variable exposure to radiation among natural populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in Chernobyl affected expression of red colouration in their dorsal fur. The relative redness of dorsal fur was positively correlated with weight, but also negatively correlated with the level of background radiation. These results suggest that the development of the natural red colouration in adult bank voles is affected by ionizing background radiation, and potentially causing elevated levels of oxidative stress. Reduced production of pheomelanin allows more antioxidants to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by radiation. However, changing natural animal colouration for physiological reasons can have ecological costs, if e.g. it causes mismatch with habitat colouration and conspicuousness for predators.",Included

We aimed to determine how patient radiation doses from MPI vary across age groups in a large contemporary international cohort. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a global cross-sectional study of centers performing MPI coordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Sites provided information on each MPI study completed during a single week in March-April 2013. We compared across age groups laboratory adherence to pre-specified radiation-related best practices, radiation effective dose (ED; a whole-body measure reflecting the amount of radiation to each organ and its relative sensitivity to radiation's deleterious effects), and the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv, a target level specified in guidelines. RESULTS: Among 7911 patients undergoing MPI in 308 laboratories in 65 countries, mean ED was 10.0+/-4.5mSv with slightly higher exposure among younger age groups (trend p value<0.001). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv across age groups, or in adherence to best practices based on the median age of patients in a laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary nuclear cardiology practice, the age of the patient appears not to impact protocol selection and radiation dose, contrary to professional society guidelines.",Excluded

These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34.

387,"18F-sodium fluoride pet bone scans Background Information: 18 F-fluoride is a bone seeking positron emitting tracer with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of osseous lesions, and in particular osteolytic lesions. It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging.

The accuracy of MR was compared with other diagnostic modalities and MR morphologic and the signal intensity features of HCC were investigated. The detection rate by MR was 63%, by US 67%, by CT 50%, by DSA 74%, and by Lipiodol-CT 93%. The Mc Nemar test showed no difference between the detection rates of MR and CT, MR and DSA, MR and US, and Lipiodol-CT and DSA; however, the differences between the detection rates of MR and Lipiodol-CT and CT and Lipiodol-CT were statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05). The difference in sensitivity between the detection rates of Lipiodol-CT and US was just above the level considered significant (P less than or equal to 0.065). On T1- and T2-weighted spin echo images 83% of small HCC were hyperintense relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma. Pseudocapsule was observed in 58% of lesions on T1-weighted images in particular. We believe that US is still the best diagnostic technique for the screening of HCC. We prefer MR to CT as a second level examination to support US in noninvasive diagnosis of small HCC, since MR gives the same or slightly better results than CT without the need of ionizing radiation and large amounts of iodized contrast medium. In our opinion, more invasive examinations, such as DSA and Lipiodol-CT, cannot be avoided in cases where an exact knowledge of the number of lesions is essential for the choice of therapy.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-four patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer and a single metastatic lung tumor were included in this study. Differences in local control rates were evaluated according to gender, primary tumor site, response, tumor size, and BED. For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded

This study sought to determine the impact of a transarterial approach and prosthesis type on physician and patient exposure to radiation during TAVR. Method(s): This was a prospective study including 140 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR by transfemoral (n = 102) or transcarotid (TC) (n = 38) access at 2 centers. Implanted valves were the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; n = 38) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA; n = 102). The primary endpoint was first operator radiation exposure. The secondary endpoint was patient radiation exposure. Result(s): First operator radiation exposure was 4-fold greater during TC TAVR (P < .001). The use of a self-expanding valve was associated with a longer x-ray time (P = .015) and a 2-fold greater first operator radiation dose (P = .018). Patient radiation dose was not significantly affected by arterial approach (P = .055) or valve type (P = .095). After adjustment for potential confounders, the TC approach remained associated with a 174.8% (95% confidence interval, 80.6-318.3, P < .001) increase in first operator radiation dose, whereas the use of a self-expanding valve no longer influenced the first operator dose (P = .630). Conclusion(s): TC access and the use of a self-expanding valve were associated with a 4- and 2-fold greater first operator radiation exposure during TAVR procedures, respectively. Unlike the arterial approach, the effect of bioprosthesis type on radiation exposure was mainly related to x-ray time and was no longer significant after adjustment.Copyright © 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded

The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

1170,"Catamnestic study of cases with tardive decompensated hydrocephalus One hundred patients with decompensated hydrocephalus (60 operated, 40 nonoperated) were studied both retrospectively and prospectively at 3 moments of the disease course. The indicators were clinical: neurologic, psychic and social, and paraclinical: results of pneumoencephalography, encephalography, radioisotope cisternography. The effects of surgical treatment (ventriculocardiac derivation) and of medical treatment were evaluated at short and long term. In surgical treatment, favourable short-term outcome (headache, gait and micturition disorders, improved consciousness, psychomotor activity, social behaviour) was found in 88% of the patients; long-term favourable outcome was present in 60% of the patients and implied only the psychic and social indicators. In medical treatment the favourable short-term outcome was nonsignificant and the long-term outcome was favourable in only 32% of the patients. In the remaining cases evaluated as unfavourable, the cognitive disorders increased progressively. The predictors for favourable therapeutic outcome were: early diagnosis, early surgical intervention, the clinical form of hydrocephalus, the sequelae and short-term effects of surgical treatment.",Excluded
3141,"Squamous cell and basal cell carcinoma of the skin in relation to radiation therapy and potential modification of risk by sun exposure BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies consistently find enhanced risk of basal cell carcinoma of the skin among individuals exposed to ionizing radiation, but it is unclear whether the radiation effect occurs for squamous cell carcinoma. It is also not known whether subgroups of individuals are at greater risk, eg, those with radiation sensitivity or high ultraviolet radiation exposure., METHODS: We analyzed data from a case-control study of keratinocyte cancers in New Hampshire. Incident cases diagnosed in 1993-1995 and 1997-2000 were identified through a state-wide skin cancer surveillance system, and controls were identified through the Department of Transportation and Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service Files (n = 1121 basal cell carcinoma cases, 854 squamous cell carcinoma cases, and 1049 controls)., RESULTS: We found an association between history of radiation treatment and basal cell carcinoma. The association was especially strong for basal cell carcinomas arising within the radiation treatment field (odds ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.3), and among those treated with radiation therapy before age 20 (3.4; 1.8-6.4), those whose basal cell carcinomas occurred 40 or more years after radiation treatment (3.2; 1.8-5.8), and those treated with radiation for acne (11; 2.7-49). Similar age and time patterns of risk were observed for squamous cell carcinoma, although generally with smaller odds ratios. For basal cell carcinoma, early exposure to radiation treatment was a risk factor largely among those without a history of severe sunburns, whereas for squamous cell carcinoma, radiation treatment was a risk factor primarily among those with a sun-sensitive skin type (ie, a tendency to sunburn)., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation treatment, particularly if experienced before age 20, seems to increase the long-term risk of both basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin. These risks may differ by sun exposure or host response to sunlight exposure.",Excluded
2499,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded
216,"Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (Astro-CHARM) Coronary Calcium Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a powerful novel risk indicator for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Currently, there is no available ASCVD risk prediction tool that integrates traditional risk factors and CAC., METHODS: To develop a CAC ASCVD risk tool for younger individuals in the general population, subjects aged 40 to 65 without prior cardiovascular disease from 3 population-based cohorts were included. Cox proportional hazards models were developed incorporating age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension treatment, family history of myocardial infarction, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and CAC scores (Astro-CHARM model [Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification]) as dependent variables and ASCVD (nonfatal/fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) as the outcome. Model performance was assessed internally, and validated externally in a fourth cohort., RESULTS: The derivation study comprised 7382 individuals with a mean age 51 years, 45% women, and 55% nonwhite. The median CAC was 0 (25th, 75th [0,9]), and 304 ASCVD events occurred in a median 10.9 years of follow-up. The c-statistic was 0.784 for the risk factor model, and 0.817 for Astro-CHARM ( P<0.0001). In comparison with the risk factor model, the Astro-CHARM model resulted in integrated discrimination improvement (0.0252), and net reclassification improvement (0.121; P<0.0001), as well. The Astro-CHARM model demonstrated good discrimination (c=0.78) and calibration (Nam-D'Agostino chi2, 13.2; P=0.16) in the validation cohort (n=2057; 55 events). A mobile application and web-based tool were developed to facilitate clinical application of this tool ( www.AstroCHARM.org )., CONCLUSION: The Astro-CHARM tool is the first integrated ASCVD risk calculator to incorporate risk factors, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history, and CAC data. It improves risk prediction in comparison with traditional risk factor equations and could be useful in risk-based decision making for cardiovascular disease prevention in the middle-aged general population.",Excluded
3438,"Willingness to pay for sustainable aviation depends on ticket price, greenhouse gas reductions and gender Background: There has been a plethora of research into sustainable transportation, with quite a few research studies coming out in the past few years examining sustainable aviation. Much of this research focuses on developing new types of green products, including biofuels, eco-friendly airports, recycled building materials, water reuse projects, and other sustainable practices. Fewer studies have focused on consumer willingness to pay for new sustainable aviation projects. No study that we know of has examined how much extra consumers would be willing to pay as a function of the sustainability benefit. Methods: Across two studies, 1192 participants were presented with a hypothetical scenario about flying in a commercial airplane that was designed to provide a 1050% reduction (in 10% increments) in greenhouse gases. Participants were then asked about their willingness to pay an additional 5%, 10% or 15% increase in ticket price for each of the reduction increments. Results: In general, more reductions in greenhouse gases increased willingness to pay the additional ticket price; however, this was limited in the 15% ticket price condition, particularly for long-haul flights. In addition, women were generally more willing to pay the additional ticket price compared to men; however, this was more pronounced for shorter domestic flights compared to long-haul flights. Conclusions: Airlines can expect consumers to accept a small increase in ticket prices if they are convinced that the airplane flight emits fewer greenhouse gases. We discuss the implications of these findings. 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1647,"A randomized double-blind controlled trial: Impact of probiotics on diarrhea in patients treated with pelvic radiation Background & aims: Radical radiation therapy is commonly used for treatment of pelvic cancer. Up to 80% of patients receiving radiotherapy will develop acute radiation induced diarrhea. The primary aim of this randomized double blind controlled trial is to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Bifilact on moderate and severe treatment-induced diarrhea during pelvic radiation. Method(s): Patients with pelvic cancers were treated between 2006 and 2010 at L'HOtel-Dieu de Quebec, University Health Center. Some patients had surgery before pelvic radiotherapy and some received chemotherapy. A total of 246 Patients were randomized between a placebo and either of two regiments of double strain Bifilact probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus LAC-361 and Bifidobacterium longum BB-536): a standard dose twice a day (1.3 billion CFU) or a high dose three times a day (10 billion CFU). Patients were trained to record their digestive symptoms daily with a standardized scale and they met a registered dietician and radiation oncologist every week during treatment. The main analysis compared time to first appearance of grade >=2-3-4 diarrhea using Kaplan-Meier curves as measured by proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea. Result(s): 229 patients were analyzed. The difference between the groups for overall grade 2-3-4 diarrhea was not statistically significant (p=0.13). However at 60 days, the proportion of patients without moderate and severe diarrhea in the standard dose group (35%) was more than twice as high as that of the placebo group (17%) with a hazard ratio of 0.69 (p=0.04). In patients who had surgery, the standard probiotics dose group had a better proportion of patients without very severe diarrhea than the placebo group, respectively 97% and 74% (p=0.03). In all groups, the average number of bowel movements per day during treatment was less than 3 soft stools (p=0.80) and the median abdominal pain less than 1 based on the National Cancer Institute scale (p=0.23). Conclusion(s): Standard dose of Bifilact may reduce radiation induced grade 2-3-4 diarrhea at the end of the treatment of patients with pelvic cancer. In patients operated on before RT, a standard dose of probiotics may reduce radiation induced grade 4 diarrhea. Nutritional interventions by a registered dietician seemed to reduce global digestive symptoms. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov.

1222,"Radiation therapy in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation. These results provide convincing evidence that radiation therapy is beneficial in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas.",Included
3426,"Oral green tea catechin metabolites are incorporated into human skin and protect against UV radiation-induced cutaneous inflammation in association with reduced production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoid 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid Green tea catechins (GTC) reduce UV radiation (UVR)-induced inflammation in experimental models, but human studies are scarce and their cutaneous bioavailability and mechanism of photoprotection are unknown. We aimed to examine oral GTC cutaneous uptake, ability to protect human skin against erythema induced by a UVR dose range and impact on potent cyclo-oxygenase- and lipoxygenase-produced mediators of UVR inflammation, PGE2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), respectively. In an open oral intervention study, sixteen healthy human subjects (phototype I/II) were given low-dose GTC (540 mg) with vitamin C (50 mg) daily for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-supplementation, the buttock skin was exposed to UVR and the resultant erythema quantified. Skin blister fluid and biopsies were taken from the unexposed and the UVR-exposed skin 24 h after a pro-inflammatory UVR challenge (three minimal erythema doses). Urine, skin tissue and fluid were analysed for catechin content and skin fluid for PGE2 and 12-HETE by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS. A total of fourteen completing subjects were supplement compliant (twelve female, median 42.5 years, range 29-59 years). Benzoic acid levels were increased in skin fluid post-supplementation (P= 0.03), and methylated gallic acid and several intact catechins and hydroxyphenyl-valerolactones were detected in the skin tissue and fluid. AUC analysis for UVR erythema revealed reduced response post-GTC (P= 0.037). Pre-supplementation, PGE2 and 12-HETE were UVR induced (P= 0.003, 0.0001). After GTC, UVR-induced 12-HETE reduced from mean 64 (sd 42) to 41 (sd 32) pg/mul (P= 0.01), while PGE2 was unaltered. Thus, GTC intake results in the incorporation of catechin metabolites into human skin associated with abrogated UVR-induced 12-HETE; this may contribute to protection against sunburn inflammation and potentially longer-term UVR-mediated damage.",Excluded
1152,"Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy with a total dose of 54-56Gy given in 9-7 fractions for patients with peripheral lung tumor: Impact of maximum dose and fraction size Background: Radiation-induced rib fracture after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for lung cancer has been recently reported. However, incidence of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes with a long-term follow-up time are not clarified. We examined incidence and risk factors of radiation-induced rib fracture after SBRT using moderate fraction sizes for the patients with peripherally located lung tumor. Method(s): During 2003-2008, 41 patients with 42 lung tumors were treated with SBRT to 54-56Gy in 9-7 fractions. The endpoint in the study was radiation-induced rib fracture detected by CT scan after the treatment. All ribs where the irradiated doses were more than 80% of prescribed dose were selected and contoured to build the dose-volume histograms (DVHs). Comparisons of the several factors obtained from the DVHs and the probabilities of rib fracture calculated by Kaplan-Meier method were performed in the study. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 68months. Among 75 contoured ribs, 23 rib fractures were observed in 34% of the patients during 16-48 months after SBRT, however, no patients complained of chest wall pain. The 4-year probabilities of rib fracture for maximum dose of ribs (Dmax) more than and less than 54Gy were 47.7% and 12.9% (p = 0.0184), and for fraction size of 6, 7 and 8Gy were 19.5%, 31.2% and 55.7% (p = 0.0458), respectively. Other factors, such as D2cc, mean dose of ribs, V10-55, age, sex, and planning target volume were not significantly different. Conclusion(s): The doses and fractionations used in this study resulted in no clinically significant rib fractures for this population, but that higher Dmax and dose per fraction treatments resulted in an increase in asymptomatic grade 1 rib fractures.Copyright © 2015 Aoki et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Excluded

Results were compared with a previous series of 22 patients treated without brachytherapy., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 44 months. The 5-year actuarial overall survival rate was 61.3%. The 5-year specific survival rate was 86%, with 2 local failures (local control rate 94.4%) and 4 isolated distant metastases. Ten patients developed a second primary. The overall survival was 34% for 22 patients previously treated without brachytherapy. Severe toxicities occurred in 9 patients: death (related to larynx edema or inhalation, n = 1), soft tissue necrosis (n = 1), aspiration pneumonia (n = 1), mandibular necrosis (n = 2), pharyngocutaneous fistula (n = 2), and laryngeal edema (n = 2).

84,"Late complications after high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for tongue cancer Objectives. To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE(S): Here, we report a large series in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era comparing outcomes between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with anal cancer. DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at an outpatient oncology clinic at large academic center. PATIENTS: A total of 107 patients were reviewed, 39 HIV positive and 68 HIV negative. All of the patients underwent definitive chemoradiation for anal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on patient characteristics, treatment, toxicity, and outcomes were collected. Overall survival, colostomy-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were analyzed. RESULT(S): Median follow-up was 15 months. HIV-positive patients were younger (median, 52 vs 64 years; p < 0.001) and predominantly men (82% men vs 49% men; p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in T, N, or stage groups. HIV-positive patients had a significantly longer duration from biopsy to start of chemoradiation (mean number of days, 82 vs 54; p = 0.042). There were no differences in rates of acute toxicities including diarrhea, fatigue, or dermatitis. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher rates of hospitalization (33% vs 15%; p = 0.024). The 3-year overall survival rate was 42% in HIV-positive and 76% in HIV-negative patients (p = 0.037; HR, 2.335 (95% CI, 1.032-5.283)).

2283,"Differentiation of functionally active mouse T lymphocytes from functionally inactive bone marrow precursors II. Limited recovery of T-cell responses from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture The limited differentiation of mature T cell function from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture is described and compared with similar differentiation occuring in vivo in irradiated bone marrow protected mice. Data are presented to show that a pool of precursors, similar in size to that able to produce early (transient?) regeneration in thymectomized recipients, is responsible for the development of mitogen responsive T cells active in MLC (proliferation) and CML (development of cytotoxic cells) assays. In contrast, a helper cell population which augments antibody formation from T-depleted normal spleen cells derives from a pool of similar precursors yet does not seem to be theta positive. Similarly, larger cells (perhaps typical of those giving rise to suppressor T cells in vivo) give rise to a suppressor cell pool after 4 days of culture, though again only a fraction of this suppressor activity could be attributed to theta positive cells. It is suggested that much of the data for regenration of T lymphocytes in vitro from T-depleted sources needs to be re-interpreted in terms of this evidence for a pool of post-thymic precursors of T cells in such T-deficient cell populations.",Excluded
420,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included
1611,"Frameless Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis-Related Trigeminal Neuralgia Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) affects 7% of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In such patients, TN is difficult to manage either pharmacologically and surgically. Radiosurgical rhizotomy is an effective treatment option. The nonisocentric geometry of radiation beams of CyberKnife introduces new concepts in the treatment of TN. Its efficacy for MS-related TN has not yet been demonstrated. Methods Twenty-seven patients with refractory TN and MS were treated. A nonisocentric beams distribution was chosen; the maximal target dose was 72.5 Gy. The maximal dose to the brainstem was <12 Gy. Effects on pain, medications, sensory disturbance, rate, and time of pain recurrence were analyzed. Results Median follow-up was 37 (18-72) months. Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score I-III was achieved in 23/27 patients (85%) within 45 days. Prescription isodose line (80%) accounting for a dose of 58 Gy incorporated an average of 4.85 mm (4-6 mm) of the nerve and mean nerve volume of 26.4 mm3 (range 20-38 mm3). Seven out of 27 patients (26%) had mild, not bothersome, facial numbness (Barrow Neurological Institute numbness score II). The rate of pain control decreased progressively after the first year, and only 44% of patients retained pain control 4 years later. Conclusions Frameless radiosurgery can be effectively used to perform retrogasserian rhizotomy. Pain relief was satisfactory and, with our dose/volume constraints, no sensory complications were recorded. Nonetheless, long-term pain control was possible in less than half of the patients. This is a limitation that CyberKnife radiosurgery shares with other techniques in MS patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1830,"A simplified approach to pulmonary vein visualization in cryo-balloon ablation of atrial fibrillation Background: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) by cryo balloon (CB) ablation is an effective and effcient alternative to radio frequency ablation in patients with atrial fbrillation (AF). It requires less technical infrastructure (e.g. 3D mapping systems) and typically has a steeper learning curve. Selective, multiplanar pulmonary vein (PV) angiography (PVA) has been established as the gold standard for PV visualization in CB PVI. Objective(s): We aimed to simplify this approach to achieve a reduction of procedural complexity and radiation exposure Methods: Patients with paroxysmal or early persistent AF undergoing CB based PVI from Jan. 2015 to Dec. 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients received conventional (PVA) or unselective left atrial angiography (LAA) for PV visualization. LAA was acquired by contrast injection in the AP projection.

LAA required fewer PV visualization sequences (2.0+/-0.05 vs 2.0+/-0.05; p<0.0001), resulting in reduced procedure (93+/-1.79 vs 110.8+/-3.18 min; p<0.0001), as well as lower fuoroscopy time (14.2+/-0.43 vs 19+/-0.78 min; p<0.0001) and radiation dose (634.6+/-69.58 vs 1574+/-190.8 cGcm2; p<0.0001). There was a trend to lower contrast use (78.7+/-2.8 vs. 91.3+/-5.99 ml; p=0.0573). Markers of procedural quality (PV occlusion, CB temperature, time to isolation) showed no signifcant differences. Number of CB applications (1.4+/-0.02 vs. 1.6+/-0.05; p<0.0001) and total application time per vein (297.9+/-4.62 vs. 348.9+/-11.03 seconds; p<0.0001) were slightly but signifcantly higher in the PVA group. Minor complications were equally distributed between both groups. Only one major complication (stroke) was observed in the PVA group. Conclusion(s): A simplifed CB PVI protocol, using LAA for PV visualization, facilitates reduced procedure time and radiation exposure while retaining procedural quality and safety.",Excluded
3180,"Quality of life and toxicity after SBRT for organ-confined prostate cancer, a 7-year study Objectives: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) yields excellent disease control for low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer by delivering high doses of radiation in a small number of fractions. Our report presents a 7-year update on treatment toxicity and quality of life (QOL) from 515 patients treated with prostate SBRT. Method(s): From 2006 to 2009, 515 patients with clinically localized, low-, intermediate-, and high-risk prostate cancer were treated with SBRT using Cyberknife technology. Treatment consisted of 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions. Seventy-two patients received hormone therapy. Toxicity was assessed at each follow-up visit using the expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) questionnaire and the radiation therapy oncology group urinary and rectal toxicity scale. Result(s): Median follow-up was 72 months. The actuarial 7-year freedom from biochemical failure was 95.8, 89.3, and 68.5% for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively (p < 0.001). No patients experienced acute Grade 3 or 4 acute complications. Fewer than 5% of patients had any acute Grade 2 urinary or rectal toxicity. Late toxicity was low, with Grade 2 rectal and urinary toxicity of 4 and 9.1%, respectively, and Grade 3 urinary toxicity of 1.7%. Mean EPIC urinary and bowel QOL declined at 1 month post-treatment, returned to baseline by 2 years and remained stable thereafter. EPIC sexual QOL declined by 23% at 6-12 months and remained stable afterwards. Of patients potent at baseline evaluation, 67% remained potent at last follow-up. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that SBRT, when administered to doses of 35-36.25 Gy, is efficacious and safe. With long-term follow-up in our large patient cohort, we continue to find low rates of late toxicity and excellent rates of biochemical control.Copyright © 2014 Katz and Kang.",Excluded
2229,"Effective time window in reducing pituitary adenoma size by gamma knife radiosurgery Objectives: Although the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in controlling the size of pituitary adenomas has been well demonstrated in many studies, the time period in which significant changes in tumor size occurs has been investigated in a limited fashion. It is important to determine the therapeutic window of GKRS in treating pituitary adenomas, i.e., the effective timeframe during which significant size reduction of these tumors occurs, so that alternative treatments such as further GKRS or microsurgery might be prescribed in a timely manner if clinically indicated. Method(s): This was a nested sample of an ongoing local cohort study on GKRS for pituitary adenomas at the University of Virginia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated sequences was employed. Only patients with a baseline MRI (TP0) and at least 1 follow-up study performed in the University Hospital after GKRS were included. The follow-up scans were performed at five time-points (TP1-TP5) which were 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after GKRS. The dimensional indices of the tumors were measured in three orthogonal planes, i.e., transverse (TR), antero-posterior (AP) and cranio-caudal (CC). The volumes of the tumors were estimated by using the following formula: $${\text{V}} = \pi\,({\text{TR}} \times {\text{AP}} \times {\text{CC}})/6$$V=pi(TRxAPxCC)/6. Tumor volume decrease by more than 25 % from baseline was considered as 'shrinkage', <25 % tumor size increase or decrease was considered 'static', and more than 25 % increase as 'increment'. Our cohort consisted of 21 patients, with functioning adenomas in 13 subjects i.e. six adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting and seven growth hormone (GH)-secreting, and non-functioning (NF) adenomas in eight subjects. Result(s): In 26 adenomas (8 ACTH, 9 GH and 9 NF), tumor control (tumor shrinkage or static) were achieved in 21 tumors (80.8 %); 89, 75, and 78 % for GH-secreting, ACTH-secreting and NF adenomas respectively, at the end of the 4-year follow-up period. Analysis of variance showed significant differences of GKRS margin dose among different types of tumors (p = 0.013), but not of baseline tumor volumes (p = 0.240). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association of margin dose, baseline volume or tumor type with the tumor control outcome. Comparison of tumor change using dimensional indices relative to the base time point (TP0) showed that in the sample there was an average reduction of 1.290 mm at TP1 (6 months) with p values 0.155 (parametric t test) and 0.098 (non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranked test) respectively, showing a moderate reduction in tumor dimensional indices. The change in dimensional indices at later time points (TP2-TP5) showed an average reduction ranging from 1.930 to 2.471 mm. Significant reduction in the mean dimensional indices was firstly observed at TP2 (1 year) with p values 0.013 (t test) and 0.018 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Such scale of reduction in the dimensional indices appeared to be maintained along the time axis (from TP2 to TP5). Conclusion(s): Significant decrease in tumor dimensional indices tended to occur at 1 year post-GKRS. Although to a lesser extent, such decrease in dimensional indices continued up to the end of our follow-up period.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
2052,"Utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma Background: Natural killer (NK/) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma that is common in Asia, but rare in Europe and North America. Although NK/T-cell lymphoma involves upper aerodigestive sites such as the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, it frequently involves other extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and skin. Because of the frequency of extranodal site involvement, pretreatment evaluation of disease extension is important for staging and treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was evaluated for its usefulness in the prognosis and treatment response of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relevant results were obtained. Many studies have evaluated the value of PET/CT for various types of B-cell lymphomas, but other similar studies involving T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are rare. In the present study, we compared the utility of PET/CT and conventional modalities, particularly CT, in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Method: From January 2006 to April 2010, 19 untreated patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (11 males and 8 females; median age 61 years; range 13-90 years) were included in the study. PET/CT and conventional procedures (e.g., CTs and biopsies) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to detect tumor lesions and their influence in staging and treatment strategies. PET/CT was performed as an initial staging procedure. In addition to PET/CT, all patients underwent initial staging workups, including whole-body CT with contrast media, biopsies from the bone marrow and other sites, and panendoscopies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients were evaluated for clinical stage by both evaluation modalities (PET/CT and conventional modalities) according to the Ann Arbor Staging System, and treatment strategies were first planned based on staging results. Following PET/CT, the clinical stage was reevaluated in each patient, and treatment strategies were decided based on the re-staging results. Result(s): Seven patients (37%) had bone marrow involvement, eight (42%) were in Ann Arbor stage I-II, and 11 (58%) had a systemic dissemination. Most patients with systemic dissemination (9/11, 82%) had cutaneous lesions. The median number of disease sites was 4 (range, 1-15). The median number of positive lesions was 3 (range, 1-15) by PET/CT compared to 2 (range, 0-14) by CT (p = 0.12). Using PET/CT, 108 lesions (93%) were detected, and at least one FDG-avid lesion was observed at initial staging workups in all patients. In contrast, 70 lesions (60%) were detected by CT, and three patients (16%) did not show any positive lesion. Two lesions (2%) at the nasal cavity that were detected by biopsy were undetectable by either PET/CT or CT. The nodal and extranodal regions were separately evaluated by PET/CT and conventional modalities. In total, 28 nodal lesions were detected: all (100%) were positive by PET/CT and 26 (93%) by CT. Conversely, 89 extranodal lesions were detected, and 83 (93%) and 44 (49%) were positive by PET/CT and CT (p = 0.003), respectively. For the detection of upper aerodigestive lesions, PET/CT and CT demonstrated similar results: 23 lesions (92%) vs. 17 (68%), respectively. Notably, PET/CT was superior to CT in detecting cutaneous lesions [31 lesions (100%) vs. 19 lesions (61%), respectively; p = 0.026]. Bone marrow involvement was confirmed pathologically in only seven patients; four cases (57%) were positive by PET/CT and none by CT. Using conventional modalities, 11 patients (58%) were in the localized stage and eight (42%) were in the advanced stage. Using PET/CT, eight (42%) were in stage I-II and 11 (58%) were in stage III-IV. Most patients received chemotherapy plus local irradiation in stage I-II, and intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in stage III-IV. One patient did not receive treatment because of unwillingness for treatment and older age. PET/CT findin s altered the stage and treatment strategy in four (21%) and two cases (11%). Conclusion(s): In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, PET/CT demonstrated a high detection rate for nodal and extranodal lesions, except in the bone marrow. PET/CT may have an impact on treatment strategy and is essential for risk-adapted treatment.",Excluded
314,"Mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea, 1996-2015 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea., METHODS: The study population included all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the National Dosimetry Registry (NDR) between 1996 and 2011. NDR data were linked with mortality data obtained from national registries through 2015. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative standardised mortality ratios (rSMRs) were calculated for external comparison and for adjustment of the cohort's overall healthiness., RESULTS: A total of 1099 deaths (974 in men and 125 in women) were reported from among 80 837 medical radiation workers. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population. However, occupational factors may have been involved in the increased relative mortality for several causes of death. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use.

2727,"Measuring and Monitoring Skeletal Muscle Mass after Stroke: A Review of Current Methods and Clinical Applications Objectives: Muscle mass at admission is important to survive stroke, and stroke-induced sarcopenia is a serious problem because of its poor prognosis. Muscle mass measurement and monitoring are essential for appropriate rehabilitation and nutrition management. However, few reviews are available about the muscle mass measurement and monitoring after stroke. Material(s) and Method(s): Several methods are used to assess skeletal muscle mass in stroke, such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, biomarkers, and anthropometrics. We summarized the current methods and clinical applications in stroke. Result(s): In stroke, a head CT is used to estimate muscle mass by measuring the temporal muscle. However, it can be conducted retrospectively due to radiation exposure. After stroke, limb muscle atrophy and diaphragm dysfunction are observed using ultrasound. However, ultrasound requires an understanding of the methods and skill. A bioelectrical impedance analysis can be used to assess muscle mass in patients after a stroke unless they have dynamic fluid changes. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is used for follow-up after hospital discharge. Urinary titin N-fragment and serum C-terminal agrin fragment reflect muscle atrophy after stroke. Anthropometrics may be useful with limited resources. Conclusion(s): We summarized the features of each measurement and proved the recent evidence to properly measure and monitor skeletal muscle mass after stroke.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2049,"Imaging changes over 18 months following stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastases: both late radiation necrosis and tumor progression can occur Following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases, the median time range to develop adverse radiation effect (ARE) or radiation necrosis is 7-11 months. Similarly, the risk of local tumor recurrence following SRS is OpenSPiltSPi 5% after 18 months. With improvements in systemic therapy, patients are living longer and are at risk for both late (defined as CloseSPigtSPi 18 months after SRS) tumor recurrence and late ARE, which have not previously been well described. An IRB-approved, retrospective review identified patients treated with SRS who developed new MRI contrast enhancement CloseSPigtSPi 18 months following SRS. ARE was defined as stabilization/shrinkage of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of necrosis, without tumor. Local failure (LF) was defined as continued enlargement of the lesion over time or pathologic confirmation of tumor. We identified 16 patients, with a median follow-up of 48.2 months and median overall survival of 73.0 months, who had 19 metastases with late imaging changes occurring a median of 32.9 months (range 18.5-63.2 months) after SRS. Following SRS, 12 lesions had late ARE at a median of 33.2 months and 7 lesions had late LF occurring a median of 23.6 months. As patients with cancer live longer and as SRS is increasingly utilized for treatment of brain metastases, the incidence of these previously rare imaging changes is likely to increase. Clinicians should be aware of these late events, with ARE occurring up to 5.3 years and local failure up to 3.8 years following SRS in our cohort.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
1553,"Risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors Objective: To investigate the risk of cataract extraction among adult retinoblastoma survivors. Design(s): A retrospective cohort study was performed on retinoblastoma survivors who received the diagnosis from 1914 to 1984 and were interviewed in 2000. Lens doses were estimated from radiotherapy records. The cumulative time interval to cataract extraction between dose groups was compared using the log-rank test and Cox regression. Result(s): Seven hundred fifty-three subjects (828 eyes) were available for analysis for an average of 32 years of follow-up. During this period, 51 cataract extractions were reported. One extraction was reported in an eye with no radiotherapy compared with 36 extractions in 306 eyes with 1 course of radiotherapy and 14 among 38 eyes with 2 or 3 treatments. The average time interval to cataract extraction in irradiated eyes was 51 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 48-54) following 1 treatment and 32 years (95% CI, 27-37) after 2 or 3 treatments. Eyes exposed to a therapeutic radiation dose of 5 Gy or more had a 6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.3-27.2) of cataract extraction compared with eyes exposed to 2.5 Gy or less. Conclusion(s): The results emphasize the importance of ophthalmologic examination of retinoblastoma survivors who have undergone radiotherapy. The risk of cataract extraction in untreated eyes with retinoblastoma is comparable with the risk of the general population. ©2009 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.",Included
2574,"Overexpression of AIB1 predicts resistance to chemoradiotherapy and poor prognosis in patients with primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is frequently overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the significance of AIB1 expression in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sensitivity and its effect on prognosis are still unclear. In this study, the expression of AIB1 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 98 biopsy specimens of primary ESCC patients treated with definitive CRT. AIB1 overexpression was found in 63/98 (64.3%) of the ESCCs. There was a significant association between AIB1 overexpression and distant lymph node metastases (P = 0.011), but not regional lymph node metastases. In the M0 subgroup, overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in stage T4 than in stage T2-3 (66.7%vs 38.5%, P = 0.031). In addition, AIB1 expression was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with CRT response, in which overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in the CRT resistant group than in the CRT effective group (86.5%vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that AIB1 overexpression was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (P <0.001). Furthermore, AIB1 expression could stratify patient survival in stages T2-3, T4, N1, and M0 (P < 0.05), as well as in the CRT effective group (P < 0.05), and AIB1 overexpression and CRT resistance were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors for both PFS and DSS in multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that overexpression of AIB1 is a useful predictor of CRT resistance and an independent molecular marker of poor prognosis for ESCC patients.",Excluded
2409,"Use of irradiated bone graft for impaction grafting in acetabular revision surgery: a review of fifty consecutive cases Impaction bone grafting is a useful technique in the armament of a revision hip surgeon. Traditionally fresh frozen allograft has been used for this technique. However there are concerns about the transmission of viral proteins and prions through this form of allograft. As a result irradiated bone graft has been favoured in some centres. There is no long term series describing the results of impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone. This paper reviews a consecutive series of 50 cases of acetabular revision surgery performed between 1995 and 2001 and followed up over a mean period of 45 months. The preoperative bone defect was graded by the Paprosky classification. There were 2 cases of type 1a, 9 type 2a, 15 type 2b, 7 type 2c, 10 type 3a and 7 type 3b. All cases were followed up clinically and radiologically. Case notes were reviewed for primary prosthesis, operative details and reason for revision. The radiographs were evaluated for signs of bone incorporation, remodelling, loosening and migration of the acetabular component. There were 5 cases of aseptic loosening at the end of the follow up period. One patient had recurrent dislocation and was revised. 20 cases (40%) showed changes suggestive of bone incorporation, while only 3 cases (6%) showed remodelling. Clinically a good or excellent outcome with absence of pain was achieved in 35 patients (70%). The results suggested that acetabular impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone graft is comparable to fresh frozen allograft. The low percentage of remodelling remains a concern and warrants further studies.",Excluded
903,"Cisplatin/capecitabine with intensity-modulated radiation therapy in anal squamous cell carcinoma: a preliminary study Objective: Mitomycin (MMC)/5-fluoroural (5-FU) with concurrent radiation is the standard treatment of anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC). The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) as an alternative with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in ASCC setting. Method(s): We retrospectively screened all patients with stage I-IV ASCC from January 2010 to June 2019. The records of patients who received definitive chemoradiation with cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) and IMRT were collected and analyzed. Result(s): The first patient was treated with XP in 2017, so totally 11 patients were included in our study from January 2017 to June 2019. All patients have experienced clinical complete response (cCR). After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 18-39 months), no patient had local recurrence or distant metastasis. Two-year colostomy-free survival (CFS) and two-year disease-free survival (DFS) were both 100%. The median overall survival (OS) has not reached. Grade 3 acute toxicities included leukopenia (1, 9.1%), neutropenia (2, 18.2%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 18.2%). No grade 4 acute adverse events occurred.

1818,"Randomized Phase II Study of Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy +/- Panitumumab Followed by Consolidation Chemotherapy in Potentially Operable Locally Advanced (Stage IIIa, N2+) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: NRG Oncology RTOG 0839 Introduction Multimodality therapy has curative potential in locally advanced NSCLC. Mediastinal nodal sterilization (MNS) after induction chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can serve as an intermediate marker for efficacy. NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0229 demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of combining full-dose radiation (61.2 Gy) with chemotherapy followed by resection and chemotherapy. On the basis of that experience and evidence that EGFR antibodies are radiosensitizing, we explored adding panitumumab to CRT followed by resection and consolidation chemotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC with a primary end point of MNS. Methods Patients with resectable locally advanced NSCLC were eligible if deemed suitable for trimodality therapy before treatment. Surgeons were required to demonstrate expertise after CRT and adhere to specific management guidelines. Concurrent CRT consisted of weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 2.0), paclitaxel (50 mg/m2), and 60 Gy of radiation therapy delivered in 30 fractions. There was a 2:1 randomization in favor of panitumumab at 2.5 mg/kg weekly for 6 weeks. The mediastinum was pathologically reassessed before or at the time of resection. Consolidation chemotherapy was weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel, 200 mg/m2 every 21 days for two courses. The study was designed to detect an improvement in MNS from 52% to 72%. With use of a 0.15 one-sided type 1 error and 80% power, 97 patients were needed. Results The study was opened in November 2010 and closed in August 2015 by the Data Monitoring Committee after 71 patients had been accrued for futility and excessive toxicity in the experimental arm. A total of 60 patients were eligible: 19 patients (86%) who received CRT and 29 (76%) who received CRT plus panitumumab and underwent an operation. With regard to postoperative toxicity, there were three grade 4 adverse events (13.6%) and no grade 5 adverse events (0%) among those who received CRT versus six grade 4 (15.8%) and four grade 5 adverse events (10.5%) among those who received CRT plus panitumumab. The MNS rates were 68.2% (95% confidence interval: 45.1-86.1) and 50.0% (95% confidence interval: 33.4-66.6) for CRT and CRT plus panitumumab, respectively (p = 0.95). Conclusion The addition of panitumumab to CRT did not improve MNS. There was an unexpectedly high mortality rate in the panitumumab arm, although the relationship to panitumumab is unclear. The control arm had outcomes similar to those in NRG Oncology RTOG 0229.Copyright © 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",Excluded
3429,"Radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy: A cross-sectional study of nasopharyngeal cancer patients after definitive radiotherapy Purpose: To address the characteristics and the causative factors of radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy (CNP) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with an extensive period of followed-up. Patients and Methods: A total of 317 consecutive and nonselected patients treated with definitive external-beam radiotherapy between November 1962 and February 1995 participated in this study. The median doses to the nasopharynx and upper neck were 71 Gy (range, 55-86 Gy) and 61 Gy (range, 34-72 Gy), respectively. Conventional fractionation was used in 287 patients (90.5%). Forty-five patients (14.2%) received chemotherapy. Result(s): The median follow-up was 11.4 years (range, 5.1-38.0 years). Ninety-eight patients (30.9%) developed CNP, with a median latent period of 7.6 years (range, 0.3-34 years). Patients had a higher rate of CNP (81 cases, 25.5%) in lower-group cranial nerves compared with upper group (44 cases, 13.9%) (chi2 = 34.444, p < 0.001). Fifty-nine cases experienced CNP in more than one cranial nerve. Twenty-two of 27 cases (68.8%) of intragroup CNP and 11 of 32 cases (40.7%) of intergroup CNP occurred synchronously (chi2 = 4.661, p = 0.031). The cumulative incidences of CNP were 10.4%, 22.4%, 35.5%, and 44.5% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that CNP at diagnosis, chemotherapy, total radiation dose to the nasopharynx, and upper neck fibrosis were independent risk factors for developing radiation-induced CNP. Conclusion(s): Radiation-induced fibrosis may play an important role in radiation-induced CNP. The incidence of CNP after definitive radiotherapy for NPC remains high after long-term follow-up and is dose and fractionation dependent. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2514,"A multicenter study comparing the outcome of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation between cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation in patients with heart failure (CRABL-HF): Study design Background: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly performed worldwide in patients with heart failure (HF). However, it has been recently emphasized that AF ablation in patients with HF is associated with increased risks of procedure-related complications and mortality. There are little data about the differences in the efficacy and safety between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF in patients with HF. Method(s): The CRABL-HF study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of AF ablation between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF (LVEF <=40%) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032433). The CRABL-HF study will consist of 110 patients at multicenter in Japan. The patients will be registered and randomly assigned to either the CB ablation or RF ablation group with a 1:1 allocation. The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) at 1 year with a blanking period of 90 days after ablation. Key secondary endpoints are the success rate of the pulmonary vein isolation, total procedural time, left atrial dwelling time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, complication rate, composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in quality of life. Result(s): The results of this study are currently under investigation.

537,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for low-risk early breast cancer in elderly women: Evidence from randomized trials Breast cancer is the most common cancer pathology in women in the Western world. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years and in the coming decades it is estimated that the number of elderly women affected reaches an important percentage. This aging of the cancer population, associated with its inherent comorbidities and aggravated by the lack of consensus about the most appropriate treatment, make it difficult to administer an effective postoperative treatment in elderly women with a low-risk profile. An exhaustive geriatric evaluation is a sine qua non condition to opt for a specific type of treatment. To date, several options are available such as endocrine therapy (ET) alone, moderate/high hypofractionation and various accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques. In this article, we provide information about each of them. Copyright © 2020 Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-six family members of 56 thyroid cancer patients were included in the study. Thyroid cancer patients were given 3.7GBq of 131I and remained in a radiation protection ward for 3 days. Radiation protection recommendations were given to patients and relatives. Life conditions were recorded and radiation doses were monitored using a personal dosimeter. Results and Discussion: At discharge, the mean residual activity was 188MBq. The mean radiation dose delivered to relatives during the 7 days after discharge was low (51.5muSv) and was similar with either recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) (59muSv) or withdrawal (50muSv) (p=0.37). Conclusion(s): With our current practice, radiation doses to relatives are low and well below international recommendations. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
2139,"Increased risk for vertebral fractures with long-term observation in mild primary hyperparathyroidism: Five year data from the scandinavian investigation of primary hyperparathyroidism (SIPH) Introduction Cohort studies using surrogate endpoints suggest decreased fracture risk after parathyroidectomy in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but long-term prospective studies are lacking. Here we report 5 year data on bone mineral density (BMD) and vertebral fracture (VF) incidence from the SIPH study1, where patients with PHPT were randomized to either parathyroidectomy (PTX) or observation (OBS). Methods Data were available from 130 patients (OBS n= 67, PTX n= 63) 5 years after randomization (mean age at inclusion 62 years, 9 men in each group). Baseline biochemistry (total Calcium (Ca), Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Creatinine) and BMD Z-scores by DXA (Z) for lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) were similar in the two groups. Lateral radiographs of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained at baseline, and after 2 and 5 years. Two radiologists, blinded to randomization and clinical data, evaluated the radiographs in consensus, using the semiquantitative method of Genant2 (including also L5). Results Basic biochemistry was stable in the OBS group, and normalized after parathyroidectomy (P< 0.001 for Ca and PTH). For the OBS group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.3 (IQR: -1.25 to +1.0) and in FN-0.2 (IQR: -0.9 to +0.5). After 5 years BMD Z in LS was-0.2 (IQR: -1.2 to +0.6) and in FN -0.6 (IQR: -1.0 to +0.1); not significant for both sites. For the PTX group, baseline BMD Z in LS was -0.2 (IQR: -1.0 to +1.0) and in FN -0.3 (IQR: 1.0 to +0.3). After 5 years BMD Z in LS increased to +0.4 (IQR: -0.7 to +1.2) and in FN to -0.2 (IQR: -0.7 to +0.4); P< 0.01 for both sites. The change in Z-scores (LS; FN) was different between OBS and PTX (P=0.04; P=0.013). At 5 years, X-rays were available for 110 patients (15 men) with baseline radiographs and at least one follow-up radiograph. Fifty-six patients were randomized to OBS (6 men) and 54 to PTX (9 men). Total follow-up time was 267.9 years (mean 4.8 years) in the OBS group and 271.5 years (mean 5.0 years) in the PTX group. There were 12 VFs in 10 patients (all women; 9.1% of all patients) at baseline (4 OBS patients with 6 VFs, 6 PTX patients with 6 VFs). During follow-up, 5 new VFs occurred in 5 patients (women), exclusively in the OBS group. Thus, 8.9% of the patients randomized to OBS, and none in the PTX group (P= 0.029), developed a new VF. Four of the new VFs occurred in patients with no VFs at baseline. All new VFs were of mild to moderate degree, and none had symptoms that could be related to the VF. Conclusion Five years after randomization, biochemistry and BMD Z-scores were stable with observation. Following parathyroidectomy biochemistry normalized and BMD Z-scores increased. New nonsymptomatic vertebral fractures developed in 5 females in the observation group, a significantly higher risk for fractures than following surgery.",Excluded
1314,"Treatment approach and survival from glioblastoma: Results from a population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway Objectives To evaluate treatment and survival from glioblastoma in a real-world setting. Design and settings A population-based retrospective cohort study from Western Norway. Participants 363 patients aged 18 years or older diagnosed with glioblastoma between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2014. Primary and secondary outcome measures Overall survival and survival rates determined by Kaplan-Meier method, groups compared by log-rank test. Associations between clinical characteristics and treatment approach assessed by logistic regression. Associations between treatment approach and outcome analysed by Cox regression. Results Median overall survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 9.1 to 11.3). Resection was performed in 221 patients (60.9%), and was inversely associated with age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden, deep-seated tumour localisation and multifocality. Median survival was 13.7 months (95% CI 12.1 to 15.4) in patients undergoing tumour resection, 8.3 months (95% CI 6.6 to 9.9) in patients undergoing biopsy and 4.5 months (95% CI 4.0 to 5.1) in patients where no surgical intervention was performed. Chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol was given to 157 patients (43%). Age over 70 years, higher comorbidity burden and cognitive impairment were associated with less intensive chemoradiotherapy. Median survival was 16.3 months (95% CI 14.1 to 18.5), 7.9 months (95% CI 6.7 to 9.0) and 2.0 months (95% CI 0.9 to 3.2) in patients treated according to the Stupp protocol, with less intensive chemoradiotherapy and with best supportive care, respectively. Surgical resection (HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.79)) and chemoradiotherapy according to the Stupp protocol (HR 0.09 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.15)) were strongly associated with favourable overall survival, when adjusted for clinical variables. Conclusions In a real-world setting, less than half of the patients received full-course chemoradiotherapy, with a median survival comparable to results from clinical trials. Survival was considerably worse in patients receiving less intensive treatment. Our results point out a substantial risk of undertreating glioblastoma, especially in elderly patients.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

1029,"Cancer incidence among Australian nuclear industry workers To assess whether workers at Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre (LHSTC) had different levels of cancer incidence from the New South Wales (NSW) population in Australia. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken at LHSTC. Data on 7,076 workers employed between 1957-98 were abstracted from personnel, dosimetry, and medical files. An inception cohort was defined which included 4,523 workers in employment between 1972-96 to examine cancer incidence. Cancer registrations in the inception cohort were identified to 1996 through electronic linkage of records with the NSW and the Australian national registers of cancer incidence. All-cancer incidence in workers at LHSTC was 15% below the NSW rates [SIR=0.85; 95% CI=(0.75, 0.95)]. Of 37 specific cancers and groups of cancers examined, statistically significant excesses relative to NSW rates were observed only for pleural cancer incidence [SIR=17.71; 95%=(7.96, 39.43)], and for incidence of cancer of the small intestine [SIR=4.34; 95% CI=(1.40, 13.46)]. This study gives little evidence of an increased risk of cancers associated with radiation exposure in a cohort of nuclear workers in Australia. The observed increase in the risk of cancer of the pleura was probably due to unmeasured exposures, given the lack of an established association with radiation exposure, and the strong link to asbestos exposure. Findings for cancers of the small intestine were based on small numbers and were likely to be due to chance.",Included
1383,"IMRT/VMAT for malignancies in the head-and-neck region : Outcome in patients aged 80 OBJECTIVE: Elderly patients with malignant head-and-neck tumors (HNT) often pose a therapeutic challenge. They frequently have significant comorbidities which may influence their ability to tolerate tumor-specific therapies. Our aim was to investigate the outcome of patients aged 80+ years undergoing curative intent intensity- or volume-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT/VMAT)., METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our HNT patients aged 80+ treated with curative IMRT/VMAT from December 2003 to November 2015. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), and treatment tolerance were assessed. Outcome results were compared with that of a younger HNT patient cohort from our hospital., RESULTS: A total of 140 consecutive patients were included (65 postoperative, 75 definitive). Mean/median age at treatment start was 84.8/84.1 years (range 80-96 years). Mean/median follow-up time was 25/16 months (range 2-92 months). Of the 140 patients, 80 were alive with no evidence of disease when last seen, 28 had died due to the cancer, 12 remained alive with disease, the remaining 20 died intercurrently. Systemic concomitant therapy was administered in 7 %. Late grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in 2 %. All patients completed treatment. Hospitalization and feeding tube rates were 26 % and 11 %, respectively. The 2-/3-year LC, DFS, and OS rates for the entire cohort were 81/80 %, 69/63 %, and 68/66 %, respectively. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients showed an inferior 3-year OS rate as compared to non-SCC patients (62 % vs 77 %, p = 0.0002), while LC and DFS did not differ. Patients undergoing postoperative radiation attained a higher OS compared to the definitively irradiated subgroup with 74 vs. 60 % at 3 years (p = 0.01); however, DFS rates were similar for both groups (68 vs. 61 %, p = 0.15). Corresponding rates for >1400 HNT patients <80 years treated during the same time interval were 81/80 %, 69/67 %, and 77/72 %, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Treatment tolerance in our patients aged 80+ was high. These results suggest that elderly HNT patients should not be denied potentially curative treatment strategies.",Excluded
267,"Prospective Evaluation of Reduced Dose Computed Tomography for the Detection of Low-Contrast Liver Lesions: Direct Comparison with Concurrent Standard Dose Imaging OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of reduced-dose (RD) contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with standard-dose (SD) CECT for detection of low-contrast liver lesions., METHODS: Seventy adults with non-liver primary malignancies underwent abdominal SD-CECT immediately followed by RD-CECT, aggressively targeted at 60-70 % dose reduction. SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72. ROC AUC values were 0.896/0.834/0.858/0.854 for SD-FBP/RD-FBP/RD-ASIR/RD-MBIR, respectively. RD-FBP (P = 0.002) and RD-MBIR (P = 0.032) AUCs were significantly lower than those of SD-FBP; RD-ASIR was not (P = 0.052). Reader confidence was lower for all RD series (P < 0.001) compared with SD-FBP, especially when calling patients entirely negative., CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive CT dose reduction resulted in inferior diagnostic performance and reader confidence for detection of low-contrast liver lesions compared to SD. Relative to RD-ASIR, RD-FBP showed decreased sensitivity and RD-MBIR showed decreased specificity., KEY POINTS: * Reduced-dose CECT demonstrates inferior diagnostic performance for detecting low-contrast liver lesions. * Reader confidence is lower with reduced-dose CECT compared to standard-dose CECT. * Overly aggressive dose reduction may result in misdiagnosis, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. * Careful consideration of perceived risks versus benefits of dose reduction is crucial.",Excluded
1344,"Increased oxidative stress in barn swallows from the Chernobyl region The Chernobyl nuclear accident produced the largest unintended release of radionuclides in history, with dramatic consequences for humans and other organisms. Exposure to ionizing radiation is known to reduce circulating and stored levels of specific antioxidants in birds and humans, thus potentially increasing oxidative stress. However, overall effects of radioactive exposure on oxidative status have never been investigated in any free ranging vertebrate. We measured plasma antioxidant capacity and concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites in adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) from colonies with variable background radiation levels in the Chernobyl region in Ukraine and Belarus. We predicted that antioxidants would decrease while reactive oxygen metabolites would increase with exposure to increasing levels of radiation at the breeding sites. Consistent with this expectation, radiation level positively predicted plasma concentration of reactive oxygen metabolites, whereas no significant covariation was found with non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. An index of oxidative stress was also larger in barn swallows exposed to high contamination levels. Thus, radioactive contamination appeared to be responsible for the increased generation of reactive oxygen metabolites and the imbalance between reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic plasma antioxidant capacity. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

2355,"Assessment of glenoid inclination on routine clinical radiographs and computed tomography examinations of the shoulder Background: Accurate assessment of glenoid inclination is of interest for a variety of conditions and procedures. The purpose of this study was to develop an accurate and reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on standardized anterior-posterior (AP) radiographs and on computed tomography (CT) images. Material(s) and Method(s): Three consistently identifiable angles were defined: Angle alpha by line AB connecting the superior and inferior glenoid tubercle (glenoid fossa) and the line identifying the scapular spine; angle beta by line AB and the floor of the supraspinatus fossa; angle gamma by line AB and the lateral margin of the scapula. Experimental study: these 3 angles were measured in function of the scapular position to test their resistance to rotation. Conventional AP radiographs and CT scans were acquired in extension/flexion and internal/external rotation in a range up to +/-40degree. Clinical study: the inter-rater reliability of all angles was assessed on AP radiographs and CT scans of 60 patients (30 with proximal humeral fractures, 30 with osteoarthritis) by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The experimental study showed that angle alpha and beta have a resistance to rotation of up to +/-20degree. The deviation from neutral position was not more than +/-10degree. The results for the inter-rater reliability analyzed by Bland-Altman plots for the angle beta fracture group were (mean +/- standard deviation) -0.1 +/- 4.2 for radiographs and -0.3 +/- 3.3 for CT scans; and for the osteoarthritis group were -1.2 +/- 3.8 for radiographs and -3.0 +/- 3.6 for CT scans. Conclusion(s): Angle beta is the most reproducible measurement for glenoid inclination on conventional AP radiographs, providing a resistance to positional variability of the scapula and a good inter-rater reliability. © 2012 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees.",Excluded
1728,"Chemoradiation for advanced oral and (pharyngo) laryngeal carcinoma: Single institution outcome analysis Aim. Chemoradiation (CRT) is a valuable treatment option for(pharyngo)laryngeal squamous cell cancer and a palliative cure in advanced oral cancers. However, toxicity is scarcely reported. Therefore, efficacy, acute and toxic effects of chemoradiation for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were evaluated, using retrospective study. Methods. Previously untreated patients with stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were included. Radiotherapy consisted of 70 Gy/7 weeks/35 fractions. All patients received concurrent Cisplatin 40 mg/m2 weekly. Results. The most common acute toxic effects were dysphagia and mucositis. Dysphagia and xerostomia remained problematic during follow-up. Loco regional disease control was respectively 91% and 98% after 6 months. The median overall survival (calculating starting form the end of the treatment) was 33 months (range 0-111 months). The 5-year disease specific survival was 41%. Conclusion. The results indicated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is associated with high locoregional control and disease-specific survival. However, significant acute and long-term toxic effects occur, and organ preservation appears not necessarily equivalent to preservation of function in pharyngolaryngeal cancers.",Excluded
450,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem. V30 may be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism when determining an individual patient's treatment. © 2014 Akgun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

783,"Concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in parotid gland undifferentiated carcinoma Aims and background: Undifferentiated carcinoma of the parotid gland is a poor-prognosis lesion. Results in unresectable lesions, treated with radiotherapy alone, are very disappointing. Method(s): Six patients with T3-4 N0-1 inoperable lesions were treated with conventional radiotherapy (64-70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction 5 times a week) and concomitant cisplatin (100 mg/m2, days 1, 22 and 43). Four weeks after radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin, 80 mg/m2, day 1, + VP16, 100 mg/m2, days 1, 3 and 5, q = 3 weeks, for 3 cycles) was given. Result(s): A median dose of 66 Gy (range, 64-70 Gy) was delivered, and all patients received 3 courses of cisplatin during radiotherapy. Five of 6 patients received all three chemotherapeutic adjuvant courses. Two months after the end of treatment, 3 CR (50%), 2 PR (33%) and 1 NC (16%) was observed.

The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.

441,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

891,"Mesenchymal stromal cells implantation in combination with platelet lysate product is safe for reconstruction of human long bone nonunion Objective: Nonunion is defned as a minimum of 9 months since injury without any visible progressive signs of healing for 3 months. Recent literature has shown that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells is safe, in vitro and in vivo, for treating long bone nonunion. The present study was performed to investigate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) implantation in combination with platelet lysate (PL) product for treating human long bone nonunion. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case series clinical trial, orthopedic surgeons visited eighteen patients with long bone nonunion, of whom 7 complied with the eligibility criteria. These patients received mesenchymal stromal cells (20 million cells implanted once into the nonunion site using a?uoroscopic guide) in combination with PL product. For evaluation of the effects of this intervention all the patients were followed up by taking anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of the affected limb before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the implantation. All side effects (local or systemic, serious or non-serious, related or unrelated) were observed during this time period. Result(s): From a safety perspective the MSC implantation in combination with PL was very well tolerated during the 12 months of the trial. Four patients were healed; based on the control X-ray evidence, bony union had occurred.

Aim of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of craniospinal irradiation with and without intrathecal chemotherapy and its efficacy with regard to symptom palliation and survival Patients and Methods: 16 patients (mean age 46 years; nine breast cancers, five lung cancers, one renal cell cancer, one tumor of unknown primary site) with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis occurring after a median interval from primary tumor diagnosis of 5 months (0-300 months) received craniospinal irradiation between October 1995 and May 2000. The median total dose was 36 Gy (a 1.6-2.0 Gy). Ten patients were additionally treated with intrathecal methotrexate (15 mg per cycle, 2-8 cycles). Result(s): Median survival was 12 weeks, 8 weeks after radiotherapy alone, 16 weeks after combined modality treatment. 14 patients died from disease. Eleven patients (68%) experienced regression of their neurological symptoms during or soon after completion of radiotherapy. Seven patients regained their ability to walk, six had pain reduction, three regression of bladder and bowel incontinence. In three patients symptom progression and in two patients no change occurred. Side effects were: myelo-suppression (CTC) Grade I: n = 2, Grade II: n = 4, Grade III: n = 4 patients and Grade IV: n = 1. Nine patients had dysphagia, seven mucositis, three suffered from nausea.

963,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
1983,"Histopathology of fluoroscopy-induced radiation ulcer: a case series study in comparison with morphea BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Histopathologic diagnosis of fluoroscopy-induced radiation ulcer (FIRU) can be challenging if the past history of radiation exposure is unknown. Morphea is the most important differential diagnosis. This study was intended to identify clinical and pathologic features that can be used to distinguish FIRU from morphea., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 25 specimens from 15 patients with FIRU and 21 specimens from 21 patients with morphea. Clinical findings and pathological features were analyzed., RESULTS: Thirteen of 15 patients (86.7 %) with FIRU underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease, and eleven patients had lesions in the right subscapular area. Compared with morphea, FIRU patients were more likely to display non-inflammatory infiltrates (28 %), bizarre fibroblasts (100 %), sclerosis (48 %), telangiectasia (96 %), vascular damage (64 %), and loss of skin appendages (100 %). In morphea, bizarre fibroblasts were rare (14 %), while telangiectasia (62 %) and loss of skin appendages (62 %) were variable. Loss of CD34+ cells and compression of elastic fibers could not be used to distinguish between FIRU and morphea., CONCLUSIONS: Skin lesion in the right subscapular area with presence of bizarre fibroblasts, sclerosis, telangiectasia, and loss of cutaneous appendages as seen with histology are highly characteristic of the radiation damage associated with fluoroscopic angiography.

1602,"CyberKnife radiosurgery for breast cancer spine metastases: A matched-pair analysis BACKGROUND. There are few options for breast cancer patients with spinal metastases recurrent within a previous radiation treatment field. CyberKnife radiosurgery has been used in our institution to treat such patients. To evaluate their outcomes, as there are no comparable radiation treatment options, the outcomes were compared between 18 patients with spinal metastases from breast cancer treated with CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery, 17 of which had prior radiotherapy to the involved spinal region and were progressing, and 18 matched patients who received conventional external beam radiotherapy (CRT) up-front for spinal metastases. METHODS. Radiosurgery was delivered in 3 to 5 fractions to doses ranging from 2100 to 2800 cGy. Women were matched to patients in a CRT group with respect to time from original diagnosis to diagnosis of metastases, estrogen receptor / progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, presence or absence of visceral metastases, prior radiotherapy, and prior chemotherapy. Survival and complications were compared between treatment groups. Surviving patients were followed out to 24 months. RESULTS. The CyberKnife and CRT groups were comparable along all matching dimensions and in performance status before treatment. Outcomes of treatment were similar for patients in both groups; ambulation, performance status, and pain worsened similarly across groups posttreatment. Survival and the number of complications appeared to favor the CyberKnife group, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS. The statistical comparability of the CyberKnife and CRT groups reflects the small sample size and stringent requirements for significance of the matched-pair analysis. Nevertheless, comparability in these difficult cases shows that salvage CyberKnife treatment is as efficacious as initial CRT without added toxicity. © 2007 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
1992,"[Immediate effects of irradiation of the orofacial area on the pH of salivary lactobacilli] pH and salivary lactobacilli were analysed in 22 healthy individuals and 34 patients with cancer tumors of the oral or oropharyngeal regions before and during irradiation therapy. The findings revealed in cancer patients before radiotherapy, that pH and lactobacilli were significantly lower than those in non cancer control subjects. During irradiation therapy, pH and lactobacilli were not significantly altered. No significant difference was found between patients cured by chemotherapy before radiotherapy and patients treated only by irradiations. However, pH is modified by teeth: toothless patients ph and toothed patients pH change in opposite direction.",Included
193,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included
1506,"Early stage non-small cell lung cancer treated with pencil beam scanning particle therapy: Retrospective analysis of early results on safety and efficacy Background: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of particle therapy (PT) using pencil beam scanning (PBS) technique for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Method(s): From 08/2014 to 03/2018, 31 consecutive patients with sum of the longest diameters of primary tumor and hilar lymph node < 5 cm, N0-1, M0 NSCLC treated with PT were retrospectively analyzed. Gating/active breathing control techniques were used to control tumor motion in 20 and 7 patients. PBS-based proton radiotherapy (PRT) or carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) plans were designed via Syngo planning system. PRT, PRT + CIRT boost, and CIRT were used in 6, 6 and 19 patients, respectively. Prescriptions were categorized to 3 levels: 5-7.5 GyE*8-10 Fx, 4-5 GyE*15-16 Fx and 2.25-3.5 GyE*20-31 Fx. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (20 males and 11 females) with a median age of 71 (50-80) years were enrolled with a median follow-up time of 12.1 (2.9-45.2) months. Fourteen were adenocarcinomas, 7 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 non-specified NSCLC and 6 had no histological diagnosis (4/6 had previous resected lung cancer). The median tumor size was 3.1 (1.1-4.7) cm. No grade 4-5 toxicities were observed. One patient experienced grade 3 (per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03) radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) at 6.7 months from radiation started. Grade 2 acute toxicities included hematological toxicities (5 cases), RILI (2), plural pain (1) and dermatitis (1). Grade 2 late toxicities included RILI (3) and asymptomatic rib fracture (1). Three patients had progressed disease at 4.0~10.6 months after the initiation of PT. One experienced local failure with simultaneous distant failure and died of brain metastasis at 10.8 months; one developed regional and distant failure and died of lung infection at 8.7 months; the other experienced isolated distant failure only and his disease was well controlled after salvage systemic therapy. The estimated rates of progression-free survival, local control, cause-specific survival and overall survival at 1, 2 years were 85.5% and 85.5%, 95.2% and 95.2%, 95.0% and 95.0%, 90.7% and 90.7%, respectively. Conclusion(s): PBS-based PT appears safe and effective for early stage NSCLC. Further follow-up and investigation is warranted. Trial registration: ISRCTN, ISRCTN78973763.

2463,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded
825,"Arterial stiffness and malnutrition but not abpm are associated with all-cause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis Objective: Our aim was to analyze association of diurnal variations of blood pressure with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis during a follow-up of 48 months. Design and method: A total of 126 HD patients (74m 52w; average age 61.5+/-15.8) were enrolled. All patients were dialysed by European and KDIGO guidelines. ABPM (24-hours) was performed with SpaceLab 90207 after mid-week dialysis; pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) were measured using Arteriograph after mid-week dialysis. Malnutritioninflammation score (MIS) and protein energy wasting (PEW) score were calculated in all enrolled patients. There were 67.6% of patients without prior CV disease, and prior coronary heart disease, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were diagnosed in 7.1%, 5,6%, 4.7%, 8.7%, 3.9% patients, respectively. Prior diabetes and prior hypertension were diagnosed in 26.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Result(s): There were 74.6% of non-dippers, while white coat hypertension and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 25.4% and 7.9%, respectively. During the follow up period of 48 months 69 patients died from all-cause and 53 from CV mortality. Diurnal variations of blood pressure were not associated with all-cause mortality. Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology. Due to small number of CV deaths we were not able to perform analyzes of CV deaths.",Excluded
2772,"Investigation of dosimetric variations of liver radiotherapy using deformable registration of planning CT and cone-beam CT Many patients with technically unresectable or medically inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had hepatic anatomy variations as a result of interfraction deformation during fractionated radiotherapy. We conducted this retrospective study to investigate interfractional normal liver dosimetric consequences via reconstructing weekly dose in HCC patients. Twenty-three patients with HCC received conventional fractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) were enrolled in this retrospective investigation. Among them, seven patients had been diagnosed of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) and the other 16 patients had good prognosis after treatment course. The cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans were acquired once weekly for each patient throughout the treatment, deformable image registration (DIR) of planning CT (pCT) and CBCT was performed to acquire modified CBCT (mCBCT), and the structural contours were propagated by the DIR. The same plan was applied to mCBCT to perform dose calculation. Weekly dose distribution was displayed on the pCT dose space and compared using dose difference, target coverage, and dose volume histograms. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the significant dosimetric variations. Among the 23 patients, the three weekly normal liver D50 increased by 0.2 Gy, 4.2 Gy, and 4.7 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 1.0 Gy, 2.7 Gy, and 3.1 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Mean dose to the normal liver (Dmean) increased by 0.5 Gy, 2.6 Gy, and 4.0 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 0.4 Gy, 3.1 Gy, and 3.4 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Regarding patients with RILD, the average values of the third weekly D50 and Dmean were both over hepatic radiation tolerance, while the values of patients without RILD were below. The dosimetric consequence showed that the liver dose between patients with and without RILD were different relative to the planned dose, and the RILD patients suffered from liver dose over hepatic radiation tolerance. Evaluation of routinely acquired CBCT images during radiation therapy provides biological information on the organs at risk, and dose estimation based on mCBCT could potentially form the basis for personalized response adaptive therapy.

2454,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

258,"Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing.",Excluded
243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded

Method(s): Adult patients with isolated fresh unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled into this prospective study from July 2013. Patients were divided into ATLPS or AIM groups when they were admitted to our department after considering their work requirement, fracture complexity, and surgeon's experience and were then treated accordingly. Relevant demographic, clinical and preoperative clinical data were collected and analyzed. Clinical examination and radiograph evaluation were performed 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Outcome measures were visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain, total range of motion (ROM) of the injured digit, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand scores (Quick-DASH) and grip strength (percentage of the contralateral corresponding digit). Result(s): From July 2013 to September 2014, 76 patients were treated by AIM and 71 by ATLPS. Age, sex, time from injury to operation, dominant hand, injury mechanism, fracture location, fracture type and participant occupation were similar in both groups (P > 0.05). Operations were all performed well and followed by uneventful postoperative functional recoveries. At 3-month follow-up, all clinical outcomes were significantly better in the AIM than ATLPS group (P < 0.05) except for VAS pain scores. However, at 6-month follow-up, the differences were no longer significant, indicating similar results for both types of fixation. Patients in the AIM group developed significantly more complications (P = 0.037). Sick leave was significantly longer in the AIM group (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): AIM outperforms ATLPS in the treatment of unstable metacarpal and phalangeal fractures in the early, but not the later, postoperative period; the latter is associated with significantly more complications. Patients treated by ATLPS require shorter sick leave, which is of particular benefit to workers with specialized manual skills.Copyright © 2016 Chinese Orthopaedic Association and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",Excluded

2478,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded
2862,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells.

HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters 131I and 90Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope 213Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg 213Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the 213Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts.

984,"Prognostic factors and prevention of radioembolization-induced liver disease UNLABELLED: Radioembolization (RE)-induced liver disease (REILD) has been defined as jaundice and ascites appearing 1 to 2 months after RE in the absence of tumor progression or bile duct occlusion. Our aims were to study the incidence of REILD in a large cohort of patients and the impact of a series of changes introduced in the processes of treatment design, activity calculation, and the routine use of ursodeoxycholic acid and low-dose steroids (modified protocol). Between 2003 and 2011, 260 patients with liver tumors treated by RE were studied (standard protocol: 75, modified protocol: 185). REILD appeared only in patients with cirrhosis or in noncirrhosis patients exposed to systemic chemotherapy prior to RE. Globally, the incidence of REILD was reduced in the modified protocol group from 22.7% to 5.4% and the incidence of severe REILD from 13.3% to 2.2% (P<0.0001). Treatment efficacy was not jeopardized since 3-month disease control rates were virtually identical in both groups (66.7% and 67.2%, P=0.93). Exposure to chemotherapy in the 2-month period following RE and being treated by the standard protocol were independent predictors of REILD among noncirrhosis patients. In cirrhosis, the presence of a small liver (total volume<1.5 L), an abnormal bilirubin (>1.2 mg/dL), and treatment in a selective fashion were independently associated with REILD., CONCLUSION: REILD is an uncommon but relevant complication that appears when liver tissue primed by cirrhosis or prior and subsequent chemotherapy is exposed to the radiation delivered by radioactive microspheres. We designed a comprehensive treatment protocol that reduces the frequency and the severity of REILD. Copyright © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded
2688,"Identifying the mesenchymal molecular subtype of glioblastoma using quantitative volumetric analysis of anatomic magnetic resonance images BackgroundSubtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) based on genetic and molecular alterations are thought to cause alterations in anatomic MRI owing to downstream biological changes, such as edema production, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and necrosis. The purpose of the current study was to identify a potential relationship between imaging features and the mesenchymal (MES) GBM subtype, which has the worst patient prognosis.MethodsMRIs from 46 patients with histologically confirmed GBM were retrospectively analyzed. The volume of contrast enhancement, regions of central necrosis, and hyperintensity of T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) were measured. Additionally, the ratio of T2/FLAIR hyperintense volume to the volume of contrast enhancement and necrosis was calculated.ResultsThe volume of contrast enhancement, volume of central necrosis, combined volume of contrast enhancement and central necrosis, and the ratio of T2/FLAIR to contrast enhancement and necrosis were significantly different in MES compared with non-MES GBM (Mann-Whitney, P <. 05). Receiver-operator characteristics indicated that these 4 metrics were all significant predictors of the MES phenotype. The volume ratio of T2 hyperintensity to contrast enhancement and central necrosis was significantly lower in MES vs non-MES GBM (P <. 0001), was a significant predictor of the MES phenotype (area under the curve = 0.93, P <. 001), and could be used to stratify short- and long-term overall survival (log-rank, P =. 0064 using cutoff of 3.0). These trends were also present when excluding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutant tumors and incorporating covariates such as age and KPS score.ConclusionsResults suggest that volume ratio may be a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive biomarker for quickly identifying MES GBM. © 2013 © The Author(s).",Excluded
18,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE.

Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
858,"The effect of anatomical modeling on space radiation dose estimates: A comparison of doses for NASA phantoms and the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile male and female astronauts The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) performs organ dosimetry and risk assessment for astronauts using model-normalized measurements of the radiation fields encountered in space. To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM. These body self-shielding distributions are used to generate organ dose equivalents and effective doses for five commonly evaluated space radiation environments. It is found that dosimetric differences among the phantoms are greatest for soft radiation spectra and light vehicular shielding. 2011 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",Excluded
2559,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included

No significant modifications of biliary and pancreatic secretions were demonstrated after irradiation, suggesting that these functions are not involved in the pathogenesis of the malabsorption radiation syndrome.",Excluded
1263,"The Value of Computed Tomography Imaging of the Head After Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery in Adults Background: Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus often undergo multiple follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, increasing the risk for long-term effects of ionizing radiation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the necessity as a routine diagnostic procedure and cost analysis of routine postoperative CT scan of the head after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. Method(s): In this study, we comprised adults with ventriculoperitoneal shunt operations who underwent early CT scans within 48 hours postoperatively. We reviewed the correlation between revision surgery rate and the experience of surgeons who performed surgery and provided a cost analysis. Result(s): In total, 479 surgeries were performed in 439 patients. Early revision surgery was performed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Reason for revision surgery was malposition in 9 cases and intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between the surgeon's experience and the rate of revision surgery. Placement of the ventricular catheter via an approach other than a standard right or left frontal burr hole resulted in risk of need for surgical shunt revision (P >= 0.002, odds ratio 54, confidence interval 13.5-223). A total of 468 CT scans of the head revealed a normal finding; thus, ~$562,000 could be saved by omitting postoperative head CT scans. Conclusion(s): Routine postoperative head CT scans after fentriculoperitoneal shunting are not necessary in all cases. The reduction of exposure to ionization radiation and the beneficial economic factor are main advantages.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
12,"Induction therapy of loco-regional non-small-cell lung cancer with reliable response and low toxicity (low dose radiotherapy sensitizes tumor to subsequent chemotherapy?) INTRODUCTION: For the induction therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer, we need to look for a regimen which produces a reliable high response rate with a low treatment related morbidity and mortality., METHODS: Patients in clinical stages IB, IIA and B, IIIA and B received a course of therapy with 20Gy of radiation in 2 weeks. This was followed by two courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 180mg/m(2), cisplatin 45mg/m(2), and ifosfamide 1000mg/m(2). Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated and, if suitable, underwent surgical therapy., RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were entered into the study. The overall response rate was 82.86% (95% confidence interval, 66.35-94.5%). Complete response (CR) was 20% (95% confidence interval, 8.44-36.94%). Twenty-five patients had surgical resection. Subsequently 18 patients received completion radiotherapy of additional 45Gy. The median follow up is 30 months. In 12 patients with stages IB, IIA and B, the median survival was 61 months, and 5-year survival was 55%. In 23 patients with stages IIIA and B, the median survival was 26 months, and 5-year survival was 9.5%. There was 1 patient with Grade 4 and 13 patients with Grade 3 leukopenia, and half of them received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. By the completion radiotherapy, 6 out of 18 patients had less than Grade 2 esophagitis. Five patients had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and one Grade 5 (one mortality). There was no postoperative death. The survival results were comparable to those reported recently by others, however the regimen produced a high response rate with low treatment related morbidity/mortality., CONCLUSION: It is a suitable regimen for induction therapy to include earlier stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancers.",Excluded
2625,"Adaptive and innovative Radiation Treatment FOR improving Cancer treatment outcomE (ARTFORCE); a randomized controlled phase II trial for individualized treatment of head and neck cancer BACKGROUND: Failure of locoregional control is the main cause of recurrence in advanced head and neck cancer. This multi-center trial aims to improve outcome in two ways. Firstly, by redistribution of the radiation dose to the metabolically most FDG-PET avid part of the tumour. Hereby, a biologically more effective dose distribution might be achieved while simultaneously sparing normal tissues. Secondly, by improving patient selection. Both cisplatin and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) antibodies like Cetuximab in combination with Radiotherapy (RT) are effective in enhancing tumour response. However, it is unknown which patients will benefit from either agent in combination with irradiation. We will analyze the predictive value of biological markers and (89)Zr-Cetuximab uptake for treatment outcome of chemoradiation with Cetuximab or cisplatin to improve patient selection., METHODS: ARTFORCE is a randomized phase II trial for 268 patients with a factorial 2 by 2 design: cisplatin versus Cetuximab and standard RT versus redistributed RT. Cisplatin is dosed weekly 40 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks. Cetuximab is dosed 250 mg/m(2) weekly (loading dose 400 mg/m(2)) for 6 weeks. The standard RT regimen consists of elective RT up to 54.25 Gy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to 70 Gy in 35 fractions in 6 weeks. Redistributed adaptive RT consists of elective RT up to 54.25 Gy with a SIB between 64-80 Gy in 35 fractions in 6 weeks with redistributed dose to the gross tumour volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV), and adaptation of treatment for anatomical changes in the third week of treatment.Patients with locally advanced, biopsy confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, oral cavity or hypopharynx are eligible.Primary endpoints are: locoregional recurrence free survival at 2 years, correlation of the median (89)Zr-cetuximab uptake and biological markers with treatment specific outcome, and toxicity. Secondary endpoints are quality of life, swallowing function preservation, progression free and overall survival., DISCUSSION: The objective of the ARTFORCE Head and Neck trial is to determine the predictive value of biological markers and (89)Zr-Cetuximab uptake, as it is unknown how to select patients for the appropriate concurrent agent. Also we will determine if adaptive RT and dose redistribution improve locoregional control without increasing toxicity.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01504815.",Excluded
2877,"Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: comparison between CT with model-based algorithm and MRI Introduction: The present study aims to compare low-kV CT reconstructed with MBIR technique with MRI in detecting high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in patients with pancreatic cystic lesions. Method(s): We retrospective enrolled 75 patients who underwent low-kV CT with contrast media injection for general abdominal disorders and MRI with MRCP sequences. The reviewer, blinded to clinical and histopathological data, recorded the overall number of pancreatic cystic lesions, size, location, presence of calcifications, septa, or solid enhancing or non-enhancing components, main pancreatic duct (MPD) communication, and MPD dilatation. Mean differences with 95% limits of agreement, ICC, and kappa statistics were used to compare CT and MRI. Result(s): More pancreatic cystic lesions were detected with MRI than with CT, however, the ICC value of 0.81 suggested a good agreement. According to the evaluated target lesion, a very good agreement (ICC = 0.98) was found regarding the diameter (21.4 mm CT vs 21.8 mm MRI), the location (kappa = 0.90), the detection of MPD dilatation (kappa = 1), the presence of septa (kappa = 0.86) and the MPD communication (kappa = 0.87). A moderate agreement on the assessment of enhanced components was noted (kappa = 0.44), while there was only a fair agreement about the presence of calcifications (kappa = 0.87). Conclusion(s): MDCT can be considered almost equivalent to MRI with MRCP in the evaluation of worrisome features and high-risk stigmata, offering detailed morphologic features helpful for their characterization. Implications for practice: Even if MRI is considered the reference standard in pancreatic cystic lesions characterization, CT can be considered a useful tool as a first-line imaging technique to identify worrisome features and high-risk stigmata.Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers",Excluded
2022,"The prognostic role of hemoglobin levels in patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiation for anal cancer Background: Concurrent chemo-radiation (CT-RT) is a standard therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of anal canal. Different clinical and biological factors may potentially affect outcome. We investigated the prognostic role of baseline hemoglobin (Hb) in a cohort of anal cancer patients submitted to CT-RT with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. Method(s): Up to 161 patients with clinical stage T1-T4/N0-N3/M0 were treated. Response was assessed at 6 weeks and thereafter at 3, 6 and 12 months. Two different approaches were used:a)simultaneous integrated boost following RTOG 05-29 indications;b)first sequence of 45Gy/25 fractions to the pelvis followed by 9-14.4 Gy/5-8 fractions to the macroscopic disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment Hb level had a significant correlation to OS (HR:0.53;95% CI:0.33-0.87; p = 0.001), but not to PFS (HR:0.78;95% CI:0.53-1.15; p = 0.12) Patients with pre-treatment Hb >= 12 g/dl had 5-year PFS and OS of 82.2%, compared to 29.3% and 32.8% for those below the threshold. The likelihood to achieve a complete remission increased by 5.6% for every single-unit (g/dl) increase in baseline Hb level over 11 g/dl. On multivariate analysis, response to treatment had a significant correlation to PFS (incomplete vs complete response - HR:5.43;95% CI:2.75-10.7; p < 0.0001) and OS (HR: 6.96;95% CI:2.96-16.5; p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): We showed that baseline Hb level is a strong indicator for poor response to RT-CT in anal cancer patients. A close clinical monitoring for incomplete response to treatment should be advised in patients with low pre-treatment Hb. The hypothesis that the preservation of adequate Hb level during treatment may lead to a better outcome needs prospective evaluation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
786,"Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis: Is it worth the additional cost of radiation and time? OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the potential benefits of delayed phase imaging series in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Routine contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans of 1000 consecutively examined patients (912 men, 88 women; average age, 60 years; range, 22-94 years) were retrospectively evaluated, and the added benefits of the delayed phase series through the abdomen were recorded for each examination. Examinations performed for indications requiring multiphasic imaging were excluded. Images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists, who were blinded to official CT reports. All examinations were performed between July 2008 and February 2010 at a single institution. Radiation doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure. RESULTS. Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no benefit. In addition, use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective CONCLUSION. An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrastenhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2124,"Calcium imaging and selective computed tomography angiography in comparison to functional testing for suspected coronary artery disease: the multicentre, randomized CRESCENT trial AIMS: To compare the effectiveness and safety of a cardiac computed tomography (CT) algorithm with functional testing in patients with symptoms suggestive of coronary artery disease (CAD)., METHODS AND RESULTS: Between April 2011 and July 2013, 350 patients with stable angina, referred to the outpatient clinic of four Dutch hospitals, were prospectively randomized between cardiac CT and functional testing (2 : 1 ratio). The tiered cardiac CT protocol included a calcium scan followed by CT angiography if the Agatston calcium score was between 1 and 400. Patients with test-specific contraindications were not excluded from study participation. By 1 year, fewer patients randomized to cardiac CT reported anginal complaints (P = 0.012). The cumulative radiation dose was slightly higher in the CT group (6.6 +/- 8.7 vs. 6.1 +/- 9.3 mSv; P < 0.0001). After 1.2 years, event-free survival was 96.7% for patients randomized to CT and 89.8% for patients randomized to functional testing (P = 0.011). After CT, the final diagnosis was established sooner (P < 0.0001), and additional downstream testing was required less frequently (25 vs. 53%, P < 0.0001), resulting in lower cumulative diagnostic costs (369 vs. 440; P < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: For patients with suspected stable CAD, a tiered cardiac CT protocol offers an effective and safe alternative to functional testing. Incorporating the calcium scan into the diagnostic workup was safe and lowered diagnostic expenses and radiation exposure. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

The temporal occurrence of this loss of osseous homeostasis has not to the present been shown. Purpose(s): To report the preoperative scintigraphic imaging findings in 79 patients with MRI documented medial meniscus tears and normal radiographs. Material(s) and Method(s): 79 adults (66 males and 13 females) without a history of prior injury or surgery between the ages of 27 and 61 (mean age 41) were included in the study. All patients had a normal preoperative Rosenberg x-ray (weight bearing PA radiograph) an MRI diagnostic of a structurally damaged medial meniscus, and a standard three-hour delayed technetium 99m-MDP bone scan of the knees. Result(s): 77/79 (97%) of the technetium bone scans were positive (increased scintigraphic activity) manifesting loss of osseous homeostasis in the medial compartment of the knees with documented torn medial meniscus findings of in the face of normal structural bone imaging . All patients had surgical documentation of the medial meniscus tears. Discussion(s): Loss of osseous homeostasis of the medial compartment of knees with documented medial meniscus tears was present at a time when the radiographic findings were normal. The conceptualization of the extent of the pathology in such patients needs to include loss of osseous homeostasis. Future studies documenting the post-operative history of surgically treated patients with medial meniscus tears may yield information of interest regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. It is postulated that the persistent post-operative loss of osseous homeostasis may identify those knees as ones at risk of the early development of OA, whereas the restoration of osseous homeostasis may be an important marker that such knees are not at risk for the development of OA.",Excluded
2964,"Radiation-induced comet-formation in human skin fibroblasts from radiotherapy patients with different normal tissue reactions Background: In clinical radiotherapy most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side effects. However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included
2898,"Delayed radiation necrosis of brain evaluated positron emission tomography In four patients highly suspected of having delayed radiation necrosis of the brain, regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism were studied by using positron emission tomography (PET) with the 15O-labelled gases, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG). All four patients showed marked decreases in glucose and oxygen consumption in the lesion with that suspected pathology in comparison with those in normal brain parenchyma. Two of them were histologically proved to have radiation injuries (one was radiation necrosis and another was early delayed reactions). But one patient was histologically proved to have a recurrent tumor. Although metabolic study with PET using 18FDG is generally an excellent procedure for differentiation between radiation injuries and recurrent brain tumor, these results imply that in some cases the differential diagnosis is difficult even with 18FDG. The present study demonstrated considerably more pronounced reduction in the metabolism than the decrease of the blood flow in the lesion with radiation necrosis. This result would indicate that the primary effect causing the radiation necrosis is a direct effect of irradiation on neural tissue rather than the capillary damage.",Excluded

204,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

1308,"Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma to manage seizures; preclinical studies suggest that it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for glioblastoma was associated with overall survival by retrospective multivariable analysis in a large cohort. The results suggest that HDAC inhibitors, like VA, may improve the results of RT and should be subjected to clinical trials. Purpose(s): Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS). Methods and Materials: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS. Result(s): Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA. Median OS in patients taking VA was 16.9 months (vs 13.6 months taking another AED, P=.16). Among patients taking an AED during RT, OS was associated with VA (P=.047; hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27-1.07), and RTOG RPA class (P<.0001; HR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.37-1.61). Of the 5 most common AEDs, only VAwas associated with OS. Median OS of patients receiving VA and TMZ during RT was 23.9 months (vs 15.2 months for patients taking another AED, P=.26). When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Conclusion(s): VA use during RT for GB was associated with improved OS, independently of RTOG RPA, seizure history, and concurrent TMZ use.

557,"[Influence of Professional Contact with Plutonium-239 on Indicators of the Immune Status of the Personnel at Siberian Chemical Plant] The results of the examination and monitoring of the personnel at the Siberian Chemical Plant (SChP) and adult population of Seversk are presented. The results of primary examination of the personnel who professionally contact the ionizing radiation (IR) from external sources and incorporated 239Pu showed that clinical symptoms of dysfunction of the immune system manifested themselves with a frequency of 75.30%. Infectious-inflammatory diseases (46.95%) and the combined pathology of infectious and allergic character (20.12%) were the most widespread. The allergic diseases (AD) without manifestations of an infectious component were observed not often (7.62%). The monitoring which was carried out for 10 years revealed a decrease in a percentage of persons with clinical signs of disorders of the immune system up to 60.68% among the personnel at the Chemical-Steel Plant and even more among the whole group of the studied personnel at SChP--49.68% (389 : 783). Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established. Similar dynamics of infectious and infectious and allergic syndromes is revealed when the activity of 239Pu is 40 nCi. AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included

An intraclass correlation (ICC) reliability analysis of variance model was used to assess reliability of the MEP amplitude, using a variable number of trials per block. A subset of 10 subjects repeated the protocol following 20min of rest to assess the reliability between sessions. As expected, MEP amplitudes were significantly higher as stimulus intensity increased. There were no significant differences between blocks, nor was there a significant gender effect. ICC reliability coefficients ranged between 0.09 with two trials per block and 0.97 with five trials per block. Between session reliability ranged from 0.65 to 0.83. Highly reliable MEP amplitudes can be obtained in older individuals using two blocks of TMS stimuli with five trials per block.",Excluded
2258,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA. LOH was strongly associated with sarcoma but not with treatment. The results do not support the hypothesis that IMRT increases the risk of second cancer. Thus the current practice of withholding dose-sparing IMRT from young patients may need to be re-evaluated.",Included
222,"Pictorial review of multidetector CT imaging of the preoperative evaluation of congenital heart disease Sequential segmental approach is an efficient method for complete evaluation of complex congenital heart diseases (CHD). Although echocardiography is the imaging technique of choice, recent advances in computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance have given a new dimension to the traditional diagnostic assessment of CHD. CT has advantages of fast speed, higher spatial resolution, and simultaneous lung and airway visualization. The purpose of this pictorial review is to discuss the role of CT and emphasize its protocol and the segmental approach for comprehensive assessment of CHD. Copyright © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

2532,"Surgical Risk and Survival Associated With Less Invasive Surgery for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma We compared less invasive surgery with conventional surgery for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with MPM who received surgery at Hyogo College of Medicine between July 2004 and April 2016. Patients underwent multimodal treatment comprising chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) and surgery with or without 54 Gy hemithoracic radiotherapy. Patients were grouped into 3 groups according to the surgery intended: Conventional extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 1 (until August 2009); less invasive extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 2 (after September 2009); pleurectomy/decortication was intended in Group 3 (after September 2012). We included 152 patients (median age 64 [37-71] years; 131 men, 21 women), mostly with epithelioid subtypes (91.4%). Of them, 149 (98.0%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 117 (77.0%) underwent surgery (60 had extrapleural pneumonectomy and 57 had pleurectomy/decortication). Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 94.9% (111/117), and the mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were 1.7% (2/117) and 3.4% (4/117), respectively. The overall median survival time and progression-free survival for all 152 patients were 34.9 and 17.4 months. The overall median survival time for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 18.5, 41.9, and 43.4 months, respectively. The progression-free survival for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 12.0, 24.5, and 21.8 months, respectively. Compared with conventional surgical techniques, less invasive surgery for MPM yielded lower surgical risks and comparable or improved survival.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2832,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia: Clinicopathological analysis and treatment outcome of 65 cases Objectives: To find out the demography, clinical behaviour and outcome of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in North-west Pakistan. Study Design: Case series. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Ophthalmology, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, from March 2011 to December 2017. Methodology: All patients with OSSN consulting this department were registered. A special proforma was designed to document demography, clinical features, management, and follow-up of all cases. At the end of study, the data was analysed using SPSS version 25 and the result compiled. Result(s): Sixty-five eyes with OSSN were included in the study, in which 40 (61.5%) were males and 25 (38.5%) were females. Mean age of the patients was 61.68 +/-12.76 years. Twenty-six (40%) patients were farmers and exposed to ultraviolet light for prolong period. Fifty-nine (90.8%) presented with a painless, reddish mass on ocular surface. Average size of neoplasm at presentation was 18.60 +/- 11.30 mm in large dimension. Histopathologically, 23 (35.4%) were carcinoma in situ and 41(63%) invasive squamous cell carcinoma. During the period of follow-up 41 (63.1%) cured, 21 (32.2%) developed recurrence, and 3 (4.6%) patients passed away. Conclusion(s): OSSN is common in North-west Pakistan. The presentation is late due to certain socio-economic factors; but overall behaviour of the neoplasm is almost the same as mentioned in other studies from different parts of the world.Copyright © 2020 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.

2346,"Reducing intraoperative duration and ionising radiation exposure during the insertion of distal locking screws of intramedullary nails: a small-scale study comparing the current fluoroscopic method against radiation-free, electromagnetic navigation BACKGROUND: Intramedullary nailing is the standard surgical treatment for mid-diaphyseal fractures of long bones; however, it is also a high radiation dose procedure. Distal locking is regularly cited as a demanding element of the procedure, and there remains a reliance on X-ray fluoroscopy to locate the distal holes. A recently developed electromagnetic navigation (EMN) system allows radiation-free distal locking, with a virtual on-screen image., OBJECTIVE: To compare operative duration, fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN over fluoroscopy, for the distal locking of intramedullary nails., METHOD: Consecutive patients with mid-diaphyseal fractures of the tibia and femur, treatable with intramedullary nails, were prospectively enrolled during a 9-month period. The sample consisted of 29 individuals, 19 under fluoroscopic guidance and 10 utilising EMN. Participants were allocated depending on the type of intramedullary nail used and surgeon's preference. These were further divided into tibial and femoral subcategories, relative to the fracture site., RESULTS: EMN reduced fluoroscopy time by 49 (p = 0.038) and 28 s during tibial and femoral nailings, respectively. Radiation dose was reduced by 18 cGy/cm2 (p = 0.046) during tibial and 181 cGy/cm2 during femoral nailings when utilising EMN. Operative duration was 11 min slower during tibial nailings using EMN, but 38 min faster in respect of femoral nailings., CONCLUSIONS: This study has evidenced statistically significant reductions in both fluoroscopy time and radiation dose when using EMN for the distal locking of intramedullary nails. It is expected that overall operative duration would also decrease in line with similar studies, with increased usage and a larger sample.",Excluded
3321,"Vertebral bone attenuation on low-dose chest CT: quantitative volumetric analysis for bone fragility assessment This study evaluated the use of low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) for detecting bone fragility. LDCT-measured vertebral bone attenuation by volumetric methods showed good correlation with bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA, and good diagnostic performance for identifying osteoporosis and compression fractures. The results of this study suggest the feasibility of obtaining comprehensive information on bone health in subjects undergoing LDCT., INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a prevalent but underdiagnosed disease that increases fracture risk. This study evaluated the utility of vertebral attenuation derived from low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) compared to dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for detecting bone fragility., METHODS: A total of 232 subjects (78 men and 154 women) aged above 50 years who underwent both LDCT and DXA within 30 days were evaluated. LDCT-measured bone attenuation in Hounsfield units (HU) of four vertebrae (T4, T7, T10, and L1) was evaluated using volumetric methods for correlation with DXA-measured bone mineral density (BMD) and for the diagnosis of compression fractures, osteoporosis, and low BMD (osteoporosis or osteopenia) in men and women, with DXA measurements as the reference standard., RESULTS: The average attenuation of the four vertebrae showed strong correlation with DXA-measured BMD of the lumbar spine (r = 0.726, p < 0.05). In receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, the area under the curve (AUC) across LDCT-measured thresholds of the average attenuation to distinguish compression fractures was 0.827, and a threshold of 129.5 HU yielded 90.9 % sensitivity and 64.4 % specificity. Similarly, average attenuation showed high AUCs and good diagnostic performance for detecting osteoporosis and low BMD in both men and women. Among 44 subjects with compression fractures, the average bone attenuation showed strong negative correlation with both the worst fracture grade (r = -0.525, p < 0.05) and cumulative fracture grade score (r = -0.633, p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: LDCT-measured bone attenuation by volumetric methods showed good correlation with BMD measured by DXA and good diagnostic performance for identifying bone fragility.",Excluded
2301,"Analysis of Patients Unable to Undergo Adjuvant Chemotherapy after Surgery in Stage IIIA/B Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Will They Benefit from Mediastinal Radiotherapy? Objectives The role of postoperative mediastinal radiotherapy in completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pathological N2 disease is controversial. In clinical practice, not all lung cancer patients with histologically confirmed N2 disease and a high risk for local recurrence are able to undergo postoperative concurrent radio/chemotherapy due to their physical condition or postoperative morbidities. Mediastinal radiotherapy is less compromising than a combination of radio/chemotherapy and seems likely to be tolerable for limited patients to achieve better local tumor control. Materials and Methods All patients included in this retrospective analysis were excluded from postoperative adjuvant combination chemo/radiotherapy due to their comorbidity, advanced age, or a complicated postoperative course. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy of the mediastinal lymph node stations (mean dose: 50 Gy; range: 50-54 Gy) in patients with R0 resection, additional boost of 10 Gy in patients with R1 or R2 resection, was performed postoperatively. Results A total of 110 patients were included in this analysis. Mean survival was 25.5 +/- 19.2 months. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was 75.4, 38.7, and 26.2%, respectively. Postoperative complications and the development of distant metastases did not correlate (p = 0.7). Distant metastases proved to be a significant prognostic factor of survival (p < 0.0001). Local recurrence was seen in a total of three patients (2.7%). Five-year survival of patients developing major postoperative complications was significantly inferior (p = 0.04) to those without postoperative complications. The extent of surgery had a significant impact on survival-5-year survival after lobectomy was significantly longer than after pneumonectomy (p = 0.029). R1 resection had no significant impact on the survival rates (p = 0.67). Discussion Stage III-N2 NSCLC patients with multiple comorbidities or a complicated postoperative course after surgery may benefit from modern mediastinal radiotherapy. Surgery and postoperative mediastinal radiotherapy can achieve local tumor control. Distant metastases have the highest impact on the prognosis. Pneumonectomy, however, should be avoided in stage III NSCLC, when possible. Copyright Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.",Excluded
3138,"Gene-arsenic interaction in longitudinal changes of blood pressure: Findings from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) in Bangladesh Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and mounting evidence indicates that toxicant exposures can profoundly impact on CVD risk. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that arsenic (As) exposure is positively related to increases in blood pressure (BP), a primary CVD risk factor. However, evidence of whether genetic susceptibility can modify the association between As and BP is lacking. In this study, we used mixed effect models adjusted for potential confounders to examine the interaction between As exposure from well water and potential genetic modifiers on longitudinal change in BP over approximately 7. years of follow-up in 1137 subjects selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort in Bangladesh. Genotyping was conducted for 235 SNPs in 18 genes related to As metabolism, oxidative stress and endothelial function. We observed interactions between 44 SNPs with well water As for one or more BP outcome measures (systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure (PP)) over the course of follow-up. The interaction between CYBA rs3794624 and well water As on annual PP remained statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (FDR-adjusted p for interaction = 0.05). Among individuals with the rs3794624 variant genotype, well water As was associated with a 2.23. mm. Hg (95% CI: 1.14-3.32) greater annual increase in PP, while among those with the wild type, well water As was associated with a 0.13. mm. Hg (95% CI: 0.02-0.23) greater annual increase in PP. Our results suggest that genetic variability may contribute to As-associated increases in BP over time.Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
33,"Olecranon fractures in adults: Factors influencing outcome In a retrospective, non-randomized study, we reviewed our experience with the operative treatment of olecranon fractures to find out which factors correlate with subjective complaints and functional outcome. A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1446,"Long-term hearing outcomes following stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma: Patterns of hearing loss and variables influencing audiometric decline Object. The goals of this retrospective cohort study were as follows: 1) to describe the long-term prevalence and timing of hearing deterioration following low-dose (12- to 13-Gy marginal dose) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for vestibular schwannoma (VS); and 2) to identify clinical variables associated with long-term preservation of useful hearing following treatment. Methods. Patients with serviceable hearing who underwent SRS for VS between 1997 and 2002 were studied. Data including radiosurgery treatment plans, tumor characteristics, pre- and posttreatment pure tone average, speech discrimination scores, and American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery hearing class were collected. Time to nonserviceable hearing was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate associations with time to nonserviceable hearing were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results. Forty-four patients met the study criteria and were included. The median duration of audiometric follow- up was 9.3 years. Thirty-six patients developed nonserviceable hearing at a mean of 4.2 years following SRS. The Kaplan-Meier estimated rates of serviceable hearing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years following SRS were 80%, 55%, 48%, 38%, and 23%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that pretreatment ipsilateral pure tone average (p < 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.009) were statistically significantly associated with time to nonserviceable hearing. Conclusions. Durable hearing preservation a decade after low-dose SRS for VS occurs in less than one-fourth of patients. Variables including preoperative hearing capacity and tumor size may be used to predict hearing outcomes following treatment. These findings may assist in pretreatment risk disclosure. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the importance of long-term follow-up when reporting audiometric outcomes following SRS for VS. © AANS, 2013.",Excluded
2817,"Skull-base invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Magnetic resonance imaging findings and therapeutic implications Purpose: To evaluate the value of skull-base abnormality on MRI for predicting local recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Between November 1988 and February 1997, 48 patients with NPC were examined with both MRI (1.5 T) and CT prior to radiation therapy. T classification (1987 UICC) based on physical examination and CT findings were T1 in 3 cases, T2 in 22, T3 in 9, and T4 in 14. On MRI, low-intensity tissue with Gd enhancement in the marrow of the skull was considered to be a suspicious finding of skull-base invasion. CT simulation was performed in all patients. The total dose to the primary tumor was 60-75 Gy (mean, 67 Gy). The mean follow-up period was 42 months. Result(s): All 14 T4 patients had abnormal tissue in the marrow of the skull base on MRI. Thirty-eight percent (13 of 34) of T1-3 patients were suspected to have skull-base invasion based on MRI (0% for T1, 27% [6 of 22] for T2, and 78% [7 of 9] for T3). The 5-year local control rate was significantly different between T1-3 and T4 tumors (97% vs. 69%, p < 0.025) but was not different by the presence of the MRI abnormality in the skull base. Conclusion(s): Skull-base invasion suspected solely by MRI does not relate to local recurrence provided that careful treatment planning is performed with the aid of MRI and CT simulator.

2493,"Alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy for inoperable stage III non- small-cell lung cancer: Long-term results of two phase II GOTHA trials Purpose/Objective: To report on two consecutive Phase II cooperative trials in which we evaluated the combination of alternating hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in inoperable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded
2145,"The epicondylar ratio can be reliably used on X-ray of the knee to determine the joint line Purpose: The epicondylar ratio (ER) is used to restore the individual joint line (JL), especially in revision total knee arthroplasty. It was first described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but is usually applied to a.p. radiographs of the knee for preoperative planning. The objective of the current study was to define reliable landmarks in MRI and X-ray images of the knee, which allow comparison of the image modalities. Furthermore, the correlation of the measured ER in MRI and X-rays of the knee was calculated. Method(s): A consecutive series of 87 patients who underwent an arthroscopical intervention of the knee were included into the present study. The lateral epicondyle was defined as the most lateral and distal prominence. On the medial side, the measurement was aligned to the epicondylar sulcus. The medial and lateral ER were calculated by dividing the perpendicular distance from the JL to the epicondyle by the transepicondylar distance. One observer determined the ER twice to calculate the intramethod intraobserver agreement, and a second observer obtained the intramethod interobserer agreement. The ER obtained from X-ray and MRI was compared to calculate the intermethod correlation. Result(s): The average lateral ER was 0.29 on X-ray versus 0.28 on MRI. The average medial ER was 0.33 and 0.33, respectively. Intramethod agreement ranged from 0.66 to 0.88 and intermethod correlation from 0.49 to 0.57.

2742,"Transgenerational effects of preconception paternal contamination with (55)Fe The conjecture that germline mutations induced by radiation exposure before conception may predispose subsequent offspring to cancer remains contentious. Previous experimental studies have shown that preconception paternal irradiation with (239)Pu induces perturbations in the hemopoietic systems of offspring and influences sensitivity to a secondary carcinogen. In the present study, male DBA2 mice were injected intravenously with the Auger electron emitter (55)Fe (4 kBq g(-1)) 18 or 84 days before mating with normal females. Comet analysis showed an increased incidence of DNA strand breaks in sperm from contaminated animals after 84 days, but not after 18 days, indicating spermatogonial rather than spermatid damage. Offspring were either assayed for changes in bone marrow stem cells and committed progenitors or challenged with the chemical carcinogen methyl nitrosourea (MNU, 50 mg/kg) at 10 weeks of age and monitored for the onset of malignancy. Offspring from irradiated fathers had normal peripheral blood profiles, although the stem cell population was amplified in offspring arising from those exposed to (55)Fe at 84 days before conception. Exposure to MNU significantly increased the incidence of lympho-hemopoietic malignancies in offspring from the 84-day group, but not in those from the 18-day group. These findings support the hypothesis that aberrations that are potentially leukemogenic may be transmitted to offspring after radiation damage to the paternal germline.",Excluded
159,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves deglutition in Parkinson's disease Relatively little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in human deglutition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) affords us a model for examining deglutition in humans with known impairment of the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of subthalamic nuclei (STN) DBS on the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of normal"" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.

1450,"Lack of correlation between villus and crypt damage in irradiated mouse intestine It has been observed that scanning electron microscopy is a more sensitive indicator of mucosal damage at low radiation dose levels than conventional quantitative crypt counting techniques. Three different fractionation schedules were subjected to investigation by both of these methods to try to elucidate some features of irradiation damage to the whole of the intestinal mucosa, at dose levels commonly used in clinical practice. Despite variations in the qualitative observations, there was a marked difference in two of the schedules between damage expressed as crypt counts and that described by the qualitative techniques. In the first case high crypt numbers were associated with severe mucosal damage, whereas the second schedule produced a reduced crypt count in association with low damage to the surface mucosa. A third schedule produced results in which there was a general agreement between low crypt numbers and considerable surface mucosal damage. However, observations were made of mucosal formations not previously seen on damaged mucosal surfaces. These resembled the appearance normally associated with the gut of patients suffering from coeliac disease. Variations in the qualitative observations were seen in all the schedules so that their interpretation in terms of perturbation of cellular kinetics is difficult.",Included

This study evaluates disease characteristics and treatment outcomes in oropharynx SCC in patients with and without immunosuppression. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients treated with radiotherapy for oropharynx SCC at BC Cancer from 2011 to 2016 was performed. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and competing risk analysis. Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were performed. Result(s): There were 1077 patients, of which 5.8% (n = 62) had an immunosuppressive medical condition or were taking long-term immunosuppressive medication at diagnosis. Median follow-up was 3.3 years. Three year OS for patients without immunosuppression was 79.5% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 76.8-82.0%) and for those with immunosuppression was 64.6% (95% CI 50.9-75.3%) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.68, p = 0.0062). The three year disease recurrence for patients without immunosuppression was 24.9% (95% CI 22.2-27.7%) and 44.4% (95% CI 31.5-56.6%) for those with immunosuppression (HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.45-3.11, p = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis of disease free survival (DFS) found that active smoking, advanced TNM stage, base of tongue subsite, p16 negative and unknown, no concurrent chemotherapy, higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, and lower radiation dose were also associated with worse DFS (all p < 0.05). Immunosuppressed patients had worse DFS relative to patients without immunosuppression, p < 0.001, HR 1.97 (95% CI 1.33-2.91).

Method(s): We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in five Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monastir, sousse and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2008. Result(s): The study included 52 patients; 32 men and 20 women with a mean age of 36 years (range from 18-54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 46 months (20-236 months). Induction therapy was based on thymoglobulin in 100 % and administered in a mean course of 12.4 days in 82,2 % of the patients. Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 91,2 % of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 % of cases. Acute rejection occurred in 36 of these cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 % of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 6,6 % and occurred after a mean period of 55,4 months of transplantation for solid tumors and 99 months for skin tumors. Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 58.6 % and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 21.7 % of the solid tumors, while spinocellular carcinoma formed 83% and basocellular carcinoma 17% of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8.3% cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 28.3% of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 54.7% cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion(s): We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and excessive Induction and maintenance immunosuppression. Careful follow-up may results in early intervention and decrease mortality.",Excluded
2631,"Palliative radiotherapy with electrons of appendicular osteosarcoma in 54 dogs Radiotherapy is effective for the palliation of pain associated with primary and metastatic bony neoplasia in dogs and humans, but no standard treatment protocol has been established. The goal of this study was to evaluate a 3 x 8 Gy and a 4 x 6 Gy protocol using electrons with a betatron or linear accelerator for the treatment of appendicular osteosarcoma in 54 dogs. Thirty-three dogs received chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin IV concurrently with radiotherapy. Eighty-three % (n = 45) of the dogs experienced pain relief during or following treatment. The median duration of pain relief from treatment start was 53 days. In conclusion, both protocols are effective for palliation of clinical signs of canine appendicular osteosarcoma. The outcome reported here is similar to the results of other studies using Co photons. The use of chemotherapy did not improve the response to radiotherapy.",Excluded
1047,"Epidemiological and clinical aspects in 1100 patients with plasmacytoma 1,100 patients at University of Freiburg Medical Center and at the Institute of Pathology with newly diagnosed plasmacytoma between 1943 and 1989 were identified. Records for these patients were reviewed and the incidence, association with age and employment, distribution of the sexes, tumor stage and survival time and development of secondary tumors were analyzed. The incidence rate of plasmacytoma is increasing within the last decades. Average annual incidence rate at the early 90ies was 6 per 100,000 population. Plasmacytoma mainly occurs in older patients and increases in incidence with age. The median age for diagnosis was 65 years for males and 68 years for females. 10% of patients are under 50 years of age at time of diagnosis. Neither significant association with employment nor association with exposure to hazardous goods could be seen. Males and females are affected 1:1. Secondary malignant tumors could be detected in 7,6%. If plasmacytoma is the secondary tumor, 50% of patients were treated before with ionizing radiation because of their first tumor. Prognosis for plasmacytoma depends among other things upon the age at diagnosis and the clinical tumor stage. 10-year-survival time is 13%.",Excluded
2060,"The effects of radiation and dose-fractionation on cancer and non-tumor disease development The Janus series of radiation experiments, conducted from 1970 to 1992, explored the effects of gamma and neutron radiation on animal lifespan and disease development. Data from these experiments presents an opportunity to conduct a large scale analysis of both tumor and non-tumor disease development. This work was focused on a subset of animals from the Janus series of experiments, comparing acute or fractionated exposures of gamma or neutron radiation on the hazards associated with the development of tumor and non-tumor diseases of the liver, lung, kidney or vascular system. This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system. These results highlight the complexity in the effects of radiation on the liver, lung, kidney and vascular system.",Included
2307,"Prevalence and characteristics of coronary artery anomalies detected by coronary computed tomography angiography in 5 634 consecutive patients in a single centre in Switzerland STUDY PRINCIPLES: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) allows three-dimensional visualisation of the origin, course and ending of the coronary vessels with high spatial resolution, yielding an accurate depiction of coronary artery anomalies (CAAs). This study sought to determine the prevalence, incidence and characteristics of CAAs detected with CCTA in a single centre in Switzerland., METHODS: CAAs were retrospectively identified in 5 634 consecutive patients referred for CCTA between March 2007 and July 2015. Single coronary arteries, Bland-White-Garland syndrome, anomalous coronary arteries originating from the opposite site of the sinus of Valsalva (ACAOS) with an interarterial course and coronary artery fistulas were classified as potentially malignant CAAs., RESULTS: We identified 145 patients with CAAs, resulting in an overall prevalence of 2.6% and cumulative incidence of 2.1% in all patients referred for CCTA in the observation period. Forty-nine (33.8%) patients showed malignant CAAs including 1 (0.7%) patient with Bland-White-Garland syndrome, 7 (4.8%) with single coronary arteries, 36 (24.8%) with ACAOS and an interarterial course, and 5 (3.5%) with coronary artery fistulas. The remaining 96 (66.2%) patients were classified as having benign variants., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAA detected by CCTA is not negligible. Because of its noninvasive nature, relatively low cost and low radiation exposure, a further increase in the utilisation of CCTA may be expected, which may consequently be paralleled by an increasing absolute number of incidentally detected CAAs. Hence, awareness of the main issues and possible management strategies regarding CAAs is of importance for every treating physician.",Excluded
3132,"When should the doctor order a spine X-ray? Identifying vertebral fractures for osteoporosis care: results from the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) UNLABELLED: Vertebral fractures are common but usually remain unrecognized in primary care. Data from 2908 women and 2653 men in the EPOS study were used to derive algorithms to indicate the need for a spine X-ray to identify a fracture using easily elicited determinants. At a sensitivity of 50% for identifying cases, the specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men compared with a random allocation of X-rays. Use of X-rays can be optimized by selecting patients at high risk using a short screening procedure., INTRODUCTION: Previous osteoporotic fracture is an independent risk factor for further fractures and an indication for treatment. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures before age 75, accounting for 48% of all fractures in men and 39% in women over 50. They usually remain unrecognized, so many patients requiring treatment are denied it, doubling their risk of a further fracture. Our objective was to develop an efficient algorithm indicating the need for an X-ray., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2908 women and 2653 men >or=50 years of age in the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) were analyzed. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were taken at baseline and at an average of 3.8 years later. Prevalent fractures were qualitatively diagnosed by an experienced radiologist. Fracture risk was modeled as a function of age, statural height loss since age 25, gender, and fracture history including limb fractures in the last 3 years using negative binomial regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to summarize a model's predictive ability, and a prediction algorithm was devised to identify those most likely to have a fracture., RESULTS: In a multivariate model for women, the risk of prevalent vertebral fracture significantly increased with age (RR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.46, 1.93] per decade), statural height loss (1.06, [1.03, 1.10] per centimeter decrease), self-reported history of spine fracture (7.52 [5.52, 10.23]), and history of other major fracture (1.83 [1.46, 2.28]). Higher body weight reduced risk (0.86 [0.79, 0.95] per 10-kg increase). In men, the respective RR estimates were as follows: age (1.32 [1.18, 1.49]); height loss (1.06 [1.04, 1.09]); self-reported spine fracture (5.05 [3.69, 6.90]); other major fracture (1.42 [1.12, 1.81]); and weight (0.86 [0.79, 0.94]). Using algorithms based on these easily elicited determinants, specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men at a sensitivity of 50% compared with a random allocation of X-rays. At a sensitivity of 75%, the specificity was 50% in women and 40% in men. Inclusion of hip BMD (femoral neck or trochanter), measured in 1360 women and 1046 men, significantly improved the area under the ROC curves by 4% in women (p < 0.002) but not in men (p > 0.350). Spine BMD, measured in 982 women and 847 men, produced a significant 5% AUC improvement in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.554)., CONCLUSION: A woman 65 years of age with one vertebral fracture has a one in four chance of another fracture over 5 years, which can be reduced to one in eight by treatment. Positive treatment decisions are often contingent on identifying a vertebral fracture. Selective use of lateral vertebral X-rays can be optimized using a 2-minute screening procedure administered by a nurse.",Excluded
1444,"Risk of cancer after low doses of ionising radiation: retrospective cohort study in 15 countries OBJECTIVES: To provide direct estimates of risk of cancer after protracted low doses of ionising radiation and to strengthen the scientific basis of radiation protection standards for environmental, occupational, and medical diagnostic exposures., DESIGN: Multinational retrospective cohort study of cancer mortality., SETTING: Cohorts of workers in the nuclear industry in 15 countries., PARTICIPANTS: 407 391 workers individually monitored for external radiation with a total follow-up of 5.2 million person years., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Estimates of excess relative risks per sievert (Sv) of radiation dose for mortality from cancers other than leukaemia and from leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, the main causes of death considered by radiation protection authorities., RESULTS: The excess relative risk for cancers other than leukaemia was 0.97 per Sv, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 1.97. Analyses of causes of death related or unrelated to smoking indicate that, although confounding by smoking may be present, it is unlikely to explain all of this increased risk. The excess relative risk for leukaemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukaemia was 1.93 per Sv (< 0 to 8.47). On the basis of these estimates, 1-2% of deaths from cancer among workers in this cohort may be attributable to radiation., CONCLUSIONS: These estimates, from the largest study of nuclear workers ever conducted, are higher than, but statistically compatible with, the risk estimates used for current radiation protection standards. The results suggest that there is a small excess risk of cancer, even at the low doses and dose rates typically received by nuclear workers in this study.",Included
1287,"Sex and tissue-specific differences in low-dose radiation-induced oncogenic signaling PURPOSE: The possible adverse health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure constitute a growing concern. Clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic conditions, notwithstanding that most studies of LDR effects have been performed using a single acute exposure. Sex- and tissue-specificity of the LDR-induced changes have not been considered before. We investigated LDR-related expression patterns in muscle, liver and spleen of male and female mice subjected to acute and chronic LDR exposure. Genes involved in oncogenic signaling were of specific interest, as radiation is a well-known carcinogen., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of genes coding for growth factors and growth-factor receptors, cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinases, G-proteins and nuclear DNA-binding proteins, and other important components of oncogenic signaling., RESULTS: We found sex- and tissue-specific changes in the expression of Ras superfamily members (Nras, Rab2, Rab34, Vav2), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PKCbeta, PKCmu), AP-1 factor components (Jun, JunB and FosB), Wnt signaling pathway members as well as in a variety of other cellular proto-oncogenes and oncogenes. Importantly, Western blot analysis of JunB, PKCmu and Rab2 proteins supported the transcriptomic data., CONCLUSIONS: Substantially different protein levels were observed in all three tissues (muscle, spleen and liver) of acutely and chronically irradiated female and male animals. Based on the obtained data and available literature, we discuss several possible mechanisms that may contribute to radiation-induced carcinogenesis in various tissues of males and females. From our results we could identify the genes that may serve as sex- and tissue-specific biomarkers of the LDR exposure.",Included
1761,"Reirradiation with robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy for recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) after previous radiotherapy is challenging. There is no standard approach for salvage treatment. Here we present toxicity and treatment results for recurrent NFC patients who underwent fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) as second line radiotherapy (RT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2009 and July 2012, 24 patients, with a male to female ratio of 3:1, were treated with CykerKnife R FSRT for recurrent NFC in our institution. Seven out of 24 patients had metastatic recurrent disease. Median age was 53 years (range, 20-70 years). Initial RT dose was 70Gy. The time period between initial RT and FSRT was a median of 33.2 months. The median prescription dose for FSRT was 30Gy (range, 24-30 Gy) in a median of 5 fractions (range, 4-6)., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 19.5 months (IQR: 12.2. -29.2 months). The locoregional control; progression free survival and overall survival (OS) rates for 1-, 2- and 3-year were 64%, 38%, 21%; 60%, 30%, 17% and 83%, 43%, 31%, respectively. Median OS for the entire cohort was 22 months (95% CI: 16.5-27.5). On multivariate analysis recurrent tumor stage was the only prognostic factor for OS (p=0.004). One patient exhibited grade III temporal lobe necrosis. One died because of grade IV mucositis and overlapping infection., CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of recurrent NPC is controversial. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is promising. However, the published trials are heterogeneous with respect to the selection criteria and treatment details. Prospective studies with long term follow-up data are warranted.",Excluded
3333,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included

Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 200 patients (100 male, 100 female; mean age 61.2 +/- 13.5 years, mean body mass index 27.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) equally divided into four groups matched by gender and body mass index, who had undergone portal venous phase abdominal CT with second-generation (group A, 120-kV-SECT; group B, 80/140-kV-DECT) and third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV-SECT; group D, 90/150-kV-DECT). The radiation dose was normalised for 40-cm scan length. Dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for various organs and vessels. Subjective overall image quality and reader confidence were assessed. Result(s): The effective normalised radiation dose was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in groups C (6.2 +/- 2.0 mSv) and D (5.3 +/- 1.9 mSv, P = 0.103) compared to groups A (8.8 +/- 2.3 mSv) and B (9.7 +/- 2.4 mSv, P = 0.102). Dose-independent FOM-CNR peaked for liver, kidney, and portal vein measurements (all P <= 0.0285) in group D. Subjective image quality and reader confidence were consistently rated as excellent in all groups (all >=1.53 out of 5). Conclusion(s): With both DSCT generations, abdominal DECT can be routinely performed without radiation dose penalty compared to SECT, while third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency. Key Points: * Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows for single- and dual-energy image acquisition. * Dual-energy acquisition does not increase the radiation dose in abdominal DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency compared to second-generation DSCT. * Dose-independent figure-of-merit image contrast was highest with third-generation dual-energy DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency for SECT and DECT.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3372,"Histopathologic Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence Associated with Radon Exposure among Ontario Uranium Miners Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (Ptrend < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.",Included
3123,"Effect of Denosumab or Alendronic Acid on the Progression of Aortic Stenosis: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial Background: Valvular calcification is central to the pathogenesis and progression of aortic stenosis, with preclinical and observational studies suggesting that bone turnover and osteoblastic differentiation of valvular interstitial cells are important contributory mechanisms. We aimed to establish whether inhibition of these pathways with denosumab or alendronic acid could reduce disease progression in aortic stenosis. Method(s): In a single-center, parallel group, double-blind randomized controlled trial, patients >50 years of age with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity >2.5 m/s) were randomized 2:1:2:1 to denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), placebo injection, alendronic acid (70 mg once weekly), or placebo capsule. Participants underwent serial assessments with Doppler echocardiography, computed tomography aortic valve calcium scoring, and 18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography and computed tomography. The primary end point was the calculated 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score. Result(s): A total of 150 patients (mean age, 72+/-8 years; 21% women) with calcific aortic stenosis (peak aortic jet velocity, 3.36 m/s [2.93-3.82 m/s]; aortic valve calcium score, 1152 AU [655-2065 AU]) were randomized and received the allocated trial intervention: denosumab (n=49), alendronic acid (n=51), and placebo (injection n=25, capsule n=25; pooled for analysis). Serum C-terminal telopeptide, a measure of bone turnover, halved from baseline to 6 months with denosumab (0.23 [0.18-0.33 microg/L] to 0.11 microg/L [0.08-0.17 microg/L]) and alendronic acid (0.20 [0.14-0.28 microg/L] to 0.09 microg/L [0.08-0.13 microg/L]) but was unchanged with placebo (0.23 [0.17-0.30 microg/L] to 0.26 microg/L [0.16-0.31 microg/L]). There were no differences in 24-month change in aortic valve calcium score between denosumab and placebo (343 [198-804 AU] versus 354 AU [76-675 AU]; P=0.41) or alendronic acid and placebo (326 [138-813 AU] versus 354 AU [76-675 AU]; P=0.49). Similarly, there were no differences in change in peak aortic jet velocity or 18F-sodium fluoride aortic valve uptake. Conclusion(s): Neither denosumab nor alendronic acid affected progression of aortic valve calcification in patients with calcific aortic stenosis.

Inclusion criteria were clinical stage III/IV OPC (T1-2/N1-2b, T3/N0-2b) treated with definitive split-field IMRT and prospectively collected MDADI at baseline and at least 1 posttreatment interval available in trial databases. Patients were sampled to represent likely human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated disease (HPV+/p16+ or <10 pack-years if HPV/p16 unknown). The MDADI composite scores were collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. Pairwise tests were Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included. All received bilateral neck irradiation with a median dose of 70 Gy and systemic therapy (57% concurrent, 43% induction only). Overall the mean baseline MDADI composite score was 90.1, dropping to 74.6 at 6 months (P<.0001) and rising to 78.5 (P<.0001) and 83.1 (P=.002) by 12 and 24 months relative to baseline, respectively, representing a clinically meaningful drop in MDADI scores at 6 months that partially recovers by 24 months (6 vs 24 months, P=.05). Poor MDADI scores (composite <60) were reported in 4%, 11%, 15%, and 9% of patients at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Fifteen percent of patients had a persistently depressed composite score by at least 20 points at the 24-month interval., CONCLUSION: ""Low-intermediate risk"" patients with OPC treated with laryngeal/esophageal inlet dose-optimized split-field IMRT are highly likely to report recovery of acceptable swallowing function in long-term follow-up. Only 15% report poor swallowing function and/or persistently depressed MDADI at 12 months or more after IMRT. These data serve as a benchmark future trial design and endpoint interpretation.

Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: Data from 25 patients with lung cancer who received 50 Gy/5 fractions of SBRT-HT were analyzed. Slow-scan megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) images were acquired before (pre-MVCT) and after (post-MVCT) each fraction. We analyzed the imaging quality of the 124 post-MVCT images to identify tumor contours using low-density settings. Next we examined tumor contour deviations from the planning target volume (PTV) in post- MVCT images for intrafractional tumor displacement. Result(s): Image quality was determined as good in 111/124 images from 22 patients (92%). None of the upper lung tumor images were of poor quality (74 images in 15 patients), whereas lower lung tumors yielded 14 poor-quality images out of the 50 images (3/10 patients). The difference in image quality between upper and lower lung tumors was statistically significant (p<0.01), especially when accompanied by interstitial lung shadows. Deviations in tumor position in post-MVCT images were analyzed in 110 images from 23 patients and revealed 99 images (90%) with tumor contours confined to PTV. In upper lung tumors, 4/74 images in 15 patients (5.4%) showed tumor contour deviations outside PTV. Lower lung tumors showed a higher rate of deviation with 7/36 images in 8 patients (19.4%) showing tumor contour deviations outside PTV (p<0.05). The maximum deviation was 1 mm for upper lung tumors and 2 mm for lower lung tumors. Conclusion(s): Upper lung tumors are good candidates for MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT. However, lower lung tumors, especially those adjacent to the diaphragm or pleura, can be difficult to assess, warranting precise dose delivery by MVCT image-guided SBRT-HT.",Excluded

However the relationships between lymphocyte life span and smoking as well as X-rays were not well documented. The primary aim of this study was to determine relationships between smoking X-rays (in combination and individually) and life span of lymphocytes. Blood samples from 200 healthy individuals, half of which were X-ray exposed individuals, were collected. Half of X-ray exposed and of non-X-ray exposed individuals were smokers. There were equal numbers of male and female participants. Two lymphocyte cultures, one for the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis and the other for the determination of mitotic index values were prepared using one part of the blood samples collected from the individuals. From the other part of the blood sample leukocyte and lymphocyte counts were determined with a haemogram device. Evaluation of the findings suggested that leukocyte count, lymphocyte count, mitotic index were relatively lower for the X-ray exposed individuals. In addition these values were higher for smokers than nonsmokers in general. The highest SCE rates were recorded for smoking radiology technicians. The most important finding is that lymphocyte life span is relatively low in smokers and in X-ray exposed males.",Included

Of these, seven had no recurrence, 13 had a recurrence at the primary site, five had a recurrence in the neck and three had a recurrence in the neck and at the primary site. Treatment of a primary site recurrence was difficult with seven of the eight patients submitted for major surgical resection developing serious complications. Of the six patients developing a fistula four required flap repair. The tumour specific 5-year survival for the whole group of 28 patients was 29%. The surgical treatment of locoregional recurrence following fast neutron therapy is fraught with problems and some type of flap repair is usually necessary.",Excluded
351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded
2895,"Effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser therapy on Japanese cedar pollinosis Many have reported on the effectiveness of laser surgery therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. However, the suppressive effects of laser irradiation on allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have not been reported in patients with pollinosis. This is because therapeutic effects on pollinosis are difficult to evaluate. The amount of pollen in the air varies during the year, and from year to year. Also, allergic symptoms develop due to exposure to the amount of pollen which is markedly influenced by the weather. In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded
3297,"The influence of low-level laser therapy on biomodulation of collagen and elastic fibers The study of low-level laser therapy upon extracellular matrix elements is important to understand the wound healing process under this agent. However, little is known about the interference of laser light in relation to collagen and elastic fibers. Cutaneous wounds were performed on the back of 72 Wistar rats and a Ga-Al-As low-level laser was punctually applied with different energy densities. The animals were killed after 24, 48, 72 hours and 5, 7 and 14 days. Tissues were stained with hematoxilin-eosin, sirius red fast green and orcein and then analyzed. It was observed that the treated group exhibited larger reduction of edema and inflammatory infiltrate. The treated animals presented a larger expression of collagen and elastic fibers, although without statistical significance (p > 0.05). Treatment with a dosage of 4 J/cm(2) exhibited more expressive results than that with 8 J/cm(2). In this study, the authors concluded that low-level laser therapy contributed to a larger expression of collagen and elastic fibers during the early phases of the wound healing process.",Excluded
1887,"Size-specific dose estimates for chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT: Effect of intrapatient variability in water-equivalent diameter Purpose: To develop software to automatically calculate size-specific dose estimates (SSDEs) and to assess the effect of variations in water-equivalent diameter (Dw) along the z-axis on SSDE for computed tomographic (CT) examinations of the torso. Material(s) and Method(s): In this institutional review board-approved, HIPAA-compliant, retrospective study, a software program was used to calculate Dw at each image position in 102 consecutive CT examinations of the combined chest, abdomen, and pelvis. SSDE was calculated by multiplying the size-dependent conversion factor and volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) at each image position. The variations in Dw along the z-axis were determined for six hypothetical scanning ranges: chest alone; abdomen alone; pelvis alone; chest and abdomen; abdomen and pelvis; and chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Mean SSDE was calculated in two ways: (a) from the SSDE at each position and (b) from the mean CTDIvol over each scan range and the conversion factor corresponding to Dw at the middle of the scan range. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation between SSDE values calculated in these two ways. Result(s): Across patients, for scan ranges 1-6, the mean of the difference between maximal and minimal Dw within a given patient was 5.2, 4.9, 2.5, 6.0, 5.6, and 6.5 cm, respectively. The mean SSDE values calculated by using the two methods were in close agreement, with root mean square differences of 0.9, 0.5, 0.5, 1.4, 1.0, and 1.1 mGy or 6%, 3%, 2%, 9%, 4%, and 6%, for the scan ranges of chest; abdomen; pelvis; chest and abdomen; abdomen and pelvis; and chest, abdomen, and pelvis, respectively. Conclusion(s): Using the mean CTDIvol from the whole scan range and Dw from the image at the center of the scan range provided an easily obtained estimate of SSDE for the whole scan range that agreed well with values from an image-by-image approach, with a root mean square difference less than 1.4 mGy (9%).Copyright © RSNA, 2015.",Excluded
2287,"[Non-Parametric Analysis of Radiation Risks of Mortality among Chernobyl Clean-Up Workers] Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02). Risks coefficient (slope coefficient of excess mortality at a dose of 1 Gy) for solid cancers was 1.94 (95% CI: - 3.10, 7.00) x 10(-2) and for circulation diseases it was 0.67 (95% CI: -9.61, 11.00) x 10(-2). 137 deaths from radiation-induced cancers and 47 deaths from circulation diseases were registered during a follow up period.",Included
2748,"Feasibility and safety of extended adjuvant temozolomide beyond six cycles for patients with glioblastoma Introduction: Temozolomide is the first chemotherapeutic agent proven effective for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The drug is well tolerated for its low toxicity. The current standard practice is concomitant chemoradiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Some Caucasian studies have suggested that patients might benefit from extended adjuvant cycles of temozolomide (>6 cycles) to lengthen both progression-free survival and overall survival. In the present study, we compared differences in survival and toxicity profile between patients who received conventional 6-cycle temozolomide and those who received more than 6 cycles of temozolomide. Method(s): Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without progressive disease and completed concomitant chemoradiotherapy during a 4-year period were studied. Progression-free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. t Test, U test, and correlation were chosen accordingly to examine the impact of age, extent of resection, MGMT promoter methylation status and adjuvant cycles on progression-free survival. For factors with a P value of <0.05 in univariate analyses, Cox regression hazard model was adopted to determine the strongest factors related to progression-free survival. Result(s): The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months for patients who received 6 cycles of temozolomide (n=7) and 43.4 months for those who received more than 6 cycles (n=7) [P=0.007, log-rank test]. Two patients in the former group and one in the latter group encountered grade 1 toxicity and recovered following dose adjustment. Cycles of adjuvant temozolomide were correlated with progression-free survival (P=0.016, hazard ratio=0.68). Conclusion(s): Extended cycles of temozolomide are safe and feasible for Chinese patients with disease responsive to temozolomide.Copyright © 2017, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

456,"Effective surgical adjuvant therapy for high-risk rectal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy as an adjunct to surgery for rectal cancer has been shown to reduce local recurrence but has not improved survival. In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy. We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone., METHODS: Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent). Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent). In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent). Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects were seldom severe. Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone.",Excluded
1018,"Lung cancer mortality among uranium gaseous diffusion plant workers: A cohort study 1952-2004 Background: 9%-15% of all lung cancers are attributable to occupational exposures. Reports are disparate regarding elevated lung cancer mortality risk among workers employed at uranium gaseous diffusion plants. Objective(s): To investigate whether external radiation exposure is associated with lung cancer mortality risk among uranium gaseous diffusion workers. Method(s): A cohort of 6820 nuclear industry workers employed from 1952 to 2003 at the Paducah uranium gaseous diffusion plant (PGDP) was assembled. A job-specific exposure matrix (JEM) was used to determine likely toxic metal exposure categories. In addition, radiation film badge dosimeters were used to monitor cumulative external ionizing radiation exposure. International Classification for Disease (ICD) codes 9 and 10 were used to identify 147 lung cancer deaths. Logistic and proportional hazards regression were used to estimate lung cancer mortality risk. Result(s): Lung cancer mortality risk was elevated among workers who experienced external radiation >3.5 mrem and employment duration >12 years. Conclusion(s): Employees of uranium gaseous diffusion plants carry a higher risk of lung cancer mortality; the mortality is associated with increased radiation exposure and duration of employment.",Included
168,"Optimal adjuvant radiotherapy dose for stage I, II or III Merkel cell carcinoma: an analysis of the National Cancer Database BACKGROUND: We performed an analysis of the National Cancer Database to determine optimal doses of conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with stage I/II or III Merkel cell carcinoma., METHODS: The cohort included 2735 patients with resected Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck, trunk or extremities receiving radiotherapy. Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy. Doses < 50.0 Gy for stage III Merkel cell carcinoma were associated with worsened 3-year overall survival (P < 0.0001) and increased hazard of death (2.01, confidence interval 1.43-2.82) with respect to doses between 50.0 and 57.0 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support doses of 50-57 Gy for most patients with stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma receiving conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy. In contrast to a prior National Cancer Database analysis, our results suggest doses >= 50 Gy should be strongly considered for patients with stage III Merkel cell carcinoma regardless of anatomic subsite.

3339,"Brachytherapy with iridium-192 HDR to prevent from restenosis in peripheral arteries. An update The use of stents does not appreciably improve restenosis (usually resulting from intimal hyperplasia) as compared to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) alone. The development of small-caliber probes for afterloading therapy in the biliary tract allowed us to use these for therapy in the vascular system. Using a special 9 F catheter, exact measurement of the length of the stented vascular segment and of the insertion length of the afterloading probe could be reproducibly performed. We used a Nucletron (Micro) Selectron HDR planning system version 10.10 for exact calculation, monitoring, and control of the afterloading procedure. Our source was iridium 192 (10 Ci) with a diameter of 1.1 mm. The program controls and monitors the insertion and removal of the iridium probe from the source into the special catheter through to the tip, and monitors the irradiation duration. The exposure time was around 200 seconds for a surface dose of 12 Gy. To date, a total of 40 patients have been treated with endovascular afterloading. All patients suffered from clinically relevant reocclusions or restenoses in stented vascular segments of the superficial femoral artery following successful PTA or laser treatment, within 6 to 8 months after the last therapy. In all patients it was possible to perform re-PTA treatment without remaining residual stenoses in the stented region. The additional time required as compared to PTA alone was approximately 45 minutes with most of this time spending for transportation between the cath lab and afterloading room. The follow-up period of the 40 patients ranged from 4 months to 7 1/2 years. In 33 patients, there was no deterioration of the clinical stage and no restenosis. One patient suffered from an acute thrombosis approximately 3 months after stent implantation, another patient had a stenosis 3 cm above the stented vascular segment 12 months after irradiation treatment. Follow- up examinations have revealed no evidence of nerve lesions following irradiation therapy. The tissue surrounding the artery showed no change following irradiation therapy, either in the CT, color-coded Doppler, endovascular ultrasonic scan or MRI. No complaints of discomfort were reported during or after irradiation. With the exceptions mentioned above, there was no evidence of any complications.",Excluded

Patients and methods. - A retrospective study of 68 patients (30 in stage T1 and 38 in stage T2). Results. - The median treatment duration was 6 weeks. Three months after the end of TSEB, a complete clinical response occurred in 66 patients (97%). The most marked effects of acute toxicity included localized ulcerations in 13 patients (13.2%) not requiring hospitalization. Mean follow-up was 6.5 years (1.6 to 28.7). The overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 86% and 71%, respectively. Thirty-nine patients (57.4%) experienced relapse with a mean diseasefree interval of 1.8 years. The disease-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 41% and 31%, respectively. This rate was higher when TSEB was performed early (p = 0.031). Twenty-one years after TSEB, only one case of cutaneous malignancy (basal cell carcinoma) was noted.

255,"Osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis-a rare osteosclerotic bone disorder We present a case of osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OS-CS) in an 18 year old female who presented to our clinic for evaluation of cranial sclerosis (CS). The diagnosis of CS followed work-up for sensorineural hearing loss, which revealed bilateral internal auditory canal stenosis. On presentation, she complained of daily frontal headaches, weekly migraines and right knee pain. Medical history was remarkable for a cleft palate, delayed dental eruptions, hearing loss necessitating hearing aids and irregular menses. She had not sustained any fractures. Family history was negative for bone disorders, neurological disorders or endocrinopathies. Examination revealed a well-nourished female below the mid-parental height who was normocephalic with evidence of a prominent jaw, blue sclera and hypertelorism. Musculoskeletal exam was remarkable for scoliosis and shortened 4th and 5th metacarpals. Neurologic exam was remarkable for myopia and deafness. She had a normal intellect. Work-up revealed normal bone specific alk phos, TRAP, calcium, phosphate, PTH and IGF-1 levels. 24 hr urine calcium studies were normal. Vitamin D level was 21ng/ml. Head CT imaging revealed diffuse osteosclerosis of the calvarium and the skull base with osseous encroachment of the bilateral middle ear cavities. There was hypo-pneumatization of the mastoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. DXA scan showed Z scores of: 4.1 at lumbar spine, 2.0 at left total hip, 4.7 at left femoral neck and -1.5 at 1/3 radius. Thoracic spine X-ray showed mild scoliosis. Radiographs of the femurs revealed vertically orientated sclerotic striations extending from the metaphysis to the diaphysis. Radiographs of the pelvis revealed radiating striations extending into the iliac crests. OS-CS, also known as Horan-Beighton syndrome, is a rare X-linked dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia, characterized by dense linear striations of long bones & pelvis, CS and extra-skeletal anomalies such as congenital heart disease, respiratory & renal tract abnormalities. It is caused by a mutation in the WTX (Wilm Tumor on X chromosome) gene and is often lethal in males (1). Patients may remain asymptomatic or present with complications secondary to CS, namely cranial nerve entrapment. It is important to make a diagnosis of OS-CS to enable appropriate genetic testing and enable further testing for extra-skeletal anomalies.",Excluded

In rectal tumor patients, particularly at stage IV, the level of PHA-induced BRL and the total number of rosette-forming cells (RFC) were lower than in healthy donors. Surgery did not produce any significant changes in cell-mediated immunity parameters: level of PHA-induced BRL decreased by 16,7%, while total RFC number increased by 17.2% in (mostly low-affinity forms).

402,"Underprediction of visibly complex chromosome aberrations by a recombinational-repair ('one-hit') model Purpose: Published low-LET FISH data were used to test two models of chromosome aberration production based on breakage-and-reunion or recombinational repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomness of DNA double strand break induction and misrejoining is analyzed comprehensively and adopted as a working hypothesis. Proximity effects are approximated by using interaction sites. Model results are calculated using CAS (chromosome aberration simulator) Monte Carlo computer software with two adjustable parameters. CAS can emulate the specifics of any experimental painting protocol, allowing very detailed tests of the models. Result(s): To reasonable approximation, breakage-and-reunion model predictions are consistent with low-LET FISH results, including two large, elaborate, one-paint data sets. An explicitly specified version of the recombinational-repair model severely underpredicts the frequency of the visibly complex aberration patterns most commonly observed with one-paint FISH, and is inconsistent with some observed multi-paint patterns. When high-dose effects (distortion and saturation) are taken into account quantitatively, a dose-response relation for apparently simple interchanges slightly favours the breakage-and-reunion model over the recombinational-repair model, despite being approximately linear over the dose range 2-6 Gy. Conclusion(s): The random breakage-and-reunion model gives comprehensive baseline predictions that are sufficiently accurate for the organization of experimental results. The data speak against complex aberrations being formed by the random recombinational repair pathway discussed here.",Excluded
2035,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included

The benefit of IVBT for treating ISR is well documented. However, few data exist on significant angiographic and intravascular ultrasonic in-stent lumen deterioration beyond the habitual 6-month analysis after the index radiation procedure or so-called late catch-up process in the treatment of ISR. Twenty-five consecutive patients with ISR were treated with IVBT using the Beta-Cath System (a 40 mm 90 Sr per 90 gamma source). Quantitative angiographic and IVUS analysis was performed in all of them at 6 and 12 months. IVBT was successful in all patients. Four patients (16%) developed recurrent angiographic binary restenosis at 6-month follow-up, all located within the adjacent reference segments, with 2 being associated with geographical miss. An additional 4 patients (16%) presented with recurrent ISR at 12-month follow-up, all within the stented segment.

163,"Evaluation of radiation-induced changes to parotid glands following conventional radiotherapy in patients with nasopharygneal carcinoma Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included

2700,"Post-operative stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of intracranial haemangiopericytoma: 'A Study of Dose and Outcome' Introduction: This study was performed to assess the relationship between tumour response and radiation dose in equivalent 2 Gy per fraction (EQD2). Method(s): A retrospective cohort analysis of 21 patients with a diagnosis of intracranial haemangiopericytoma between 2000 and 2013 was included in this study. A total of 39 lesions were analysed. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy per fraction was calculated by assigning an alpha-beta ratio of 12 Gy. A paired t-test compared dose (EQD2) and tumour response, and as the outcome was binary, a logistic regression analysis was performed. Result(s): In total, there were 14 cases of progression and 25 cases of non-progression. It was estimated that for a one unit increase in EQD2, the odds of non-progression were increased by a factor of 1.13 (P = 0.026). After adjusting for PTV volume, the estimated effect of EQD2 (min) on tumour response was stronger, with an estimated odds ratio of 1.36 for an increase of one unit and an odds ratio of 21.6 for an increase of 10 units (P = 0.015). The dose range varied with varying PTV volumes. Based on the logistic model, the probability of having non-progression is larger than 50% for EQ2Dmin doses larger than 30-40 Gy, in particular for volumes larger than 3.67 cm3. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrates that there is a relationship between dose (EQD2) and outcome. With increasing dose, the likelihood of regression is higher. When adjusted for PTV volume, the response appeared stronger. The dose varied significantly with changes in the size of the PTV.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

3144,"Definitive radiotherapy with interstitial implant boost for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term outcome of a cohort of patients with unresected base of tongue carcinoma who received interstitial brachytherapy after comprehensive external beam radiation therapy., METHODS: Between 1983 and 2000, 122 patients with primary or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx or oral cavity received interstitial brachytherapy as part of their overall management. Forty patients had primary, unresected carcinoma of the base of tongue and are the subjects of this analysis. The median age was 54 years. Fifty-four percent had T3 or T4 disease, and 70% had clinical or radiographic lymphadenopathy. Twenty-four (60%) received two to three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The oropharynx, bilateral neck, and supraclavicular fossae were comprehensively irradiated, and the tongue base received a median external beam dose of 61.2 Gy (50-72 Gy). The primary site was then boosted with an interstitial 192Iridium implant by use of a gold-button single-strand technique and three-dimensional treatment planning. The dose rate was prescribed at 0.4 to 0.5 Gy/hr. The median implant dose was 17.4 Gy (9.6-24 Gy) and adjusted to reach a total dose to the primary tumor of 80 Gy. N2 to 3 disease was managed by a planned neck dissection performed at the time of the implant., RESULTS: The median follow-up for all patients was 56 months, and the overall survival rates were 62% at 5 years and 27% at 10 years. The actuarial primary site control was 78% at 5 years and 70% at 10 years. The overall survival and primary site control were independent of T classification, N status, or overall stage. Systemic therapy was associated with an improvement in overall survival (p = .04) and a trend toward increased primary site control with greater clinical response. There were seven documented late effects, the most frequent being grade 3 osteonecrosis (n = 2), grade 2 swallowing dysfunction (n = 2), trismus (n = 2), and chronic throat pain (n = 1)., CONCLUSIONS: In an era of greatly improved dose distributions made possible by three-dimensional treatment planning and intensity-modulated radiation therapy, brachytherapy allows a highly conformal dose to be delivered in sites such as the oropharynx. If done properly, the procedure is safe and delivers a dose that is higher than what can be achieved by external beam radiation alone with the expected biologic advantages. The long-term data presented here support an approach of treating advanced tongue base lesions that includes interstitial brachytherapy as part of the overall management plan. This approach has led to a 78% rate of organ preservation at 5 years, with a 5% incidence of significant late morbidity (osteonecrosis) that has required medical management.

The deduced dose dependency agrees well with a previous analysis in terms of a non-parametric proportional hazards model, and confirms the temporal distribution which has been used in the Radioepidemiological Tables of NIH. However, the linear-quadratic dose-response model gives a risk estimate for low doses which is somewhat less than half that obtained under the assumption of linearity.",Excluded
3453,"Perception of radiation exposure and risk among patients, medical students, and referring physicians at a tertiary care community hospital BACKGROUND: It is important for physicians to be aware of the radiation doses as well as the risks associated with diagnostic imaging procedures that they are ordering., METHODS: A survey was administered to patients, medical students, and referring physicians from a number of specialties to determine background knowledge regarding radiation exposure and risk associated with commonly ordered medical imaging tests., RESULTS: A total of 127 patients, 32 referring physicians, and 30 medical students completed the survey. The majority of patients (92%) were not informed of the radiation risks associated with tests that they were scheduled to receive and had false perceptions about the use of radiation and its associated risks. Physicians and medical students had misconceptions about the use of ionizing radiation in a number of radiologic examinations; for example, 25% and 43% of physicians and medical students, respectively, were unaware that interventional procedures used ionizing radiation, and 28% of physicians were unaware that mammography used ionizing radiation. Computed tomographies and barium studies were thought to be associated with the least ionizing radiation among physicians., CONCLUSION: There is a need for educating the public, medical students, and referring physicians about radiation exposure and associated risk so that (1) patients receiving multiple medical imaging tests are aware of the radiation that they are receiving and (2) physicians and future physicians will make informed decisions when ordering such tests to limit the amount of radiation that patients receive and to promote informed consent among patients.

1145,"Deficiency in PER proteins has no effect on the rate of spontaneous and radiation-induced carcinogenesis There is a growing body of evidence that components of the circadian clock are involved in modulation of numerous signaling pathways, and that clock deregulation due to environmental or genetic factors contributes to the development of various pathologies, including cancer. Previous work performed in tissue culture and in in vivo mouse models defined mammalian PERIOD proteins as tumor suppressors, although some experimental inconsistencies (the use of mice on mixed genetic background, lack of sexual discrimination) did not allow a definitive conclusion. To address this issue in a systematic way, we performed a detailed analysis comparing the incidence of tumor development after low-dose ionizing radiation in male and female wild-type, Per1-/-, and Per2-/- mice. We showed that in contrast to previous reports deficiency in either Per1 or Per2 genes by itself does not make mice more tumor-prone; moreover, some of the long-term effects of ionizing radiation in Per2-deficient mice are reminiscent more of accelerated aging rather than tumor-prone phenotype. Our histopathological analysis also revealed significant sexual dimorphism both in the rate of radiation-induced tumorigenesis and in the spectrum of tumors developed, which underscores the importance of using sex-matched experimental groups for in vivo studies. Based on our results, we suggest that the role of PER proteins as bone fide tumor suppressors needs to be reevaluated. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Included

Method(s): In this study we evaluated 21 patients (8 female and 13 male) clinically and radiologically 10 years postoperative and compared them with the same group of 28 patients we operated between August 2002 and August 2003 for traumatic vertebral fractures type A with balloon kyphoplasty and CPC. Over the 10 years 7 patients were untraceable. 3 of them were not clinically impaired but didn't want to participate in the study and 4 patients we didn't found. All 21 patients underwent standard X-ray (standing) and a CT. We measured the volume of the cement, the resorption the last 10 years and the disc height in the CT and the segmental and vertebral kyphosis angle in the X ray and compared them with the X-ray (standing) and CT done directly postoperatively. To assess the pain level we used the VAS, ODI score, Roland Morris score and the Denis work scale and compared them with the same scores we recorded in the past. Result(s): The VAS score demonstrated an increase over time from a mean of 1 (0-5) at the 2 year follow up to 2.3 (0-8) at the 10 years follow up. The Roland Morris disability score also increased over time from 2 (0-8) 2 years postoperative to a mean of 3.6 (0-18) at the 10 years follow up. We recognized no complications and no reoperations were necessary. We recognized an increase of the median value for the vertebral kyphosis angle about 1degree (0degree - 4degree). The median value of the disc height diminution over the 10 years was 0.7 mm (0 - 3.9). For the anterior wall of the fractured VB the decrease of the median value was about 1 mm (0-3) and for the posterior wall it was 0 mm (0-2). So the Beck Index decreased from 0.80 (0.65 - 0.97) to 0.77 (0.62 - 0.97) at the 10 year follow up which means a decrease of the median value of 0.03 (0 - 0.07). We noticed a median value for the cement volume of 4.2 cc (2.0-8.6) postoperative and at the 10 year follow up of 3.2 cc (1.3-7.8) which means a resorption of the cement volume about 22.9 % (0.8 % - 55.5 %). Conclusion(s): In our 10 year follow up we didn't recognize any significant loss of correction of the vertebral and segmental kyphosis angle. We also didn't recognized a significant diminution of the disc height without degeneration of the disc over the last 10 years. There was a partial resorption of the cement but not as much as we expected with variable bone formation. In summary the long follow up about 10 years of kyphoplasty show us very good clinical and radiological results and in our opinion we consider this to be a treatment option for traumatic selected vertebral type A fractures also in young patients.",Excluded
3399,"Synaptic plasticity in the adult spinal dorsal horn: the appearance of new functional connections following peripheral nerve regeneration Peripherally regenerated fibers were impaled in the dorsal columns. Each impaled fiber's adequate stimulus was determined and the fiber was activated by passing brief (200 ms) current pulses through the microelectrode. Cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) elicited by fiber stimulation were recorded at 8 sites, and then the fiber was injected with Neurobiotin (NB). In the same preparations, dorsal horn cells were impaled and their receptive fields (RFs) mapped; areas of skin from which the most vigorous responses were elicited were noted. Needle electrodes inserted into these cutaneous ""hot spots"" were used to electrically activate minimal numbers of peripherally regenerated fibers while simultaneously recording the resulting CDPs and any intracellular EPSPs. This allowed determination of connectivity between regenerated fibers and dorsal horn cells with overlapping RFs. In agreement with findings in intact animals, NB revealed long-ranging collaterals which were not seen using intraaxonally injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Although there was no qualitative difference in their morphology compared to those seen in controls, the correlation between spatial distribution of boutons and amplitudes of the monosynaptic CDPs of peripherally regenerated fibers revealed significant shifts in the functional efficacy of many central connections. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation revealed a significantly higher incidence of connectivity between regenerated fibers and cells with overlapping RFs at 9-12 months (86%) than at 5-6 months (34%). Although there was no obvious anatomical reorganization of afferent projections in the dorsal horn, the observed functional changes with time following transection show the formation of new functional central connections.",Excluded
2025,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers Background: Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Method(s): Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Result(s): Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 muSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusion(s): [18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
477,"Infrastructure of radiotherapy in the Netherlands: Evaluation of prognoses and introduction of a new model for determining the needs Background and purpose: In the Netherlands, the radiotherapy infrastructure is regulated by a Governmental license system. This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. Result(s): The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. Conclusion(s): The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

408,"The usefulness of a prospective ECG gated CT angiography by 256 MDCT: Feasibility and image quality Purpose: To evaluate the usefulness of a prospectively gated transverseaxial scan (PGT) by 256-slice multidetector-row CT (MDCT) coronary angiography compared with a retrospectively gated helical scan (RGH) in patients with atypical chest pain who visited emergency room. Method(s): Between December 2009 and January 2010, among 70 consecutive patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER who performed with 256-slice CT scanner, we included the patients with heart rate (HR) of <= 75 bpm and HR variation <= 10 bpm. Therefore, we included 24 patients obtaining with PGT (mean age, 58.8+/-16.2 years; 12 men and 12 women) and 24 patients obtaining with RGH (mean age, 57.2+/-14.5 years; 12 men and 12 women). Scan was obtained from apex to kidney level. For each of 15 segments indentified according to the American Heart association's segmental model, image quality was evaluated by a radiologist using a four point grading scale: grade 4, excellent and no motion artifacts; grade 3, good and minor stairstep or motion artifacts; grade 2, moderate and presenting artifacts but still diagnostic; and grade 1, poor and not diagnostic. For each scan, radiation dose and additional extracardiac findings were estimated. Diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated the 2 patients performed conventional angiography. The image quality results between PGT and RGH scans were compared using Mann-Whitney Test. Result(s): No statistically significant differences were evident between these two groups in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics. The difference of image quality between PGT and RGH scans was not statistically significant (p = 0.5843). The image quality was regarded as grade 4 for most segments in both PGT (96.7%, 348/360) and RGH scans (98.9%, 356/360). Mean effective radiation dose was 10.4+/-1.2 mSv in patients with PGT as compared to 23.0+/-4.6 mSv in patients with RGH. Additional extracardiac findings are 10 cases in patients with PGT including lung nodule, thyroid nodule. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-gated CTA by using the PGT is useful for patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER because it can reduce radiation dose to 54.8% while maintaining image quality and diagnostic accuracy in patients with HR less than 75 bpm, and evaluate the coronary arteries, aorta, pulmonary arteries, and entire intra-thoracic structures at the same time.",Excluded

This paper reports the first analysis of the Semipalatinsk historical cohort exposed in the vicinity of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, Kazakhstan. The cohort study, which includes 19,545 inhabitants of exposed and comparison villages of the Semipalatinsk region, was set up in the 1960s and comprises 582,750 person-years of follow-up between 1960 and 1999. Cumulative effective radiation dose estimates in this cohort range from 20 mSv to approximately 4 Sv. Rates of mortality and cancer mortality in the exposed group substantially exceeded those of the comparison group. Dose-response analyses within the exposed group confirmed a significant trend with dose for all solid cancers (P < 0.0001) and for digestive and respiratory cancers (P = 0.0255 and P < 0.0001), whereas no consistent dose-response trend was found for all causes of death (P = 0.4296). Regarding specific cancer sites, a significant trend with dose was observed for lung cancer (P = 0.0001), stomach cancer (P = 0.0050), and female breast cancer (P = 0.0040) as well as for esophagus cancer in women (P = 0.0030). The excess relative risk per sievert for all solid cancers combined was 1.77 (1.35; 2.27) based on the total cohort data, yet a selection bias regarding the comparison group could not be entirely ruled out. The excess relative risk per sievert based on the cohort's exposed group was 0.81 (0.46; 1.33) for all solid cancers combined and thus still exceeds current risk estimates from the Life Span Study. Future epidemiological assessments based on this cohort will benefit from extension of follow-up and ongoing validation of dosimetric data.",Included

Methods We calculated the prevalence of psychological distress and radiotherapy (rt)-induced symptoms in 216 npc survivors who participated in a cross-sectional survey. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (version 3.0) was used to assess the qol of npc survivors. Multiple linear regression was applied to analyze the factors influencing qol. Results The prevalence rates of rt-induced symptoms and psychological problems were 11.58% (95% ci: 7.21% to 15.58%) for difficulty in swallowing, 17.59% (95% ci: 12.51% to 22.67%) for mouth dryness or sores, 13.89% (95% ci: 9.28% to 18.50%) for nasal dryness or congestion, 18.52% (95% ci: 13.34% to 23.70%) for fatigue, 11.11% (95% ci: 6.92% to 15.30%) for frequent dizziness, 18.06% (95% ci: 12.93% to 23.19%) for decline in hearing, 14.81% (95% ci: 10.07% to 19.55%) for poor sleep quality, 18.52% (95% ci: 13.34% to 23.70%) for worry about disease recurrence, 18.98% (95% ci: 13.75% to 24.21%) for anxiety, and 25.00% (95% ci: 19.23% to 30.77%) for depression. Mean survival times were 4.32 +/- 2.63 years in patients with mouth dryness or sores, 4.26 +/- 2.90 years in patients with fatigue, and 5.60 +/- 2.94 years in patients with a decline in hearing. The mean global qol score was 74.21 (95% ci: 72.22 to 76.20). At a significance level of alpha = 0.05, the factors influencing qol were age (p = 0.032), education level (p = 0.001), anxiety score (p < 0.001), depression score (p < 0.001), mouth dryness or sores (p < 0.001), fatigue (p = 0.027), and disease stage (p = 0.044). Conclusions The prevalence rates of mouth dryness or sores, fatigue, decline in hearing, depression, and anxiety were high in npc survivors with a survival time of more than 2 years. These rt-induced symptoms and psychological problems can last for many years after rt. The qol of the npc survivors was good. Factors influencing qol were age, education level, anxiety, depression, mouth dryness or sores, fatigue, and disease stage. Our results suggest that during clinical treatment, doctors should minimize the radiation dose to the ears of patients. In addition, our results emphasize the importance of providing oral and ear nursing and psychological care to npc survivors.Copyright © 2015 Multimed Inc.",Excluded
252,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded

3240,"Image quality and radiation dose of dual-energy CT of the head and neck compared with a standard 120-kVp acquisition BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DECT offers additional image datasets with potential benefits, but its use for H&N imaging is not justified unless image quality is preserved without increased radiation dose. The aim of this work was to compare image quality and radiation dose between a DE-derived WA image dataset and a standard SECT acquisition of the H&N. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent DECT of the H&N (tube voltages 80 and Sn140 kVp) and were compared with the last 32 patients who underwent standard SECT (120 kVp) on the same dual-source scanner. WA images from the 2 DE tubes were compared with images obtained with an SE mode. Radiation doses and attenuation measurements of the internal jugular vein, submandibular gland, and sternomastoid and tongue muscles were compared. Objective image noise was compared at 5 anatomic levels. Two blinded readers compared subjective image quality by using 5-point grading scales. RESULT(S): CTDIvol was 12% lower with DE than with SECT, a difference of 1.5 mGy, (P < .0001). Objective noise was not significantly different between DE and SECT at any of the anatomic levels (P > .05). No significant differences in attenuation measurements were observed between DE and SECT (P > .05). No significant differences in subjective image quality scores were observed between DE and SECT at any of the 5 anatomic levels (P > .05).

Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis found a superior LRC after SABR compared with VATS lobectomy, but OS did not differ. Our findings support the need to compare both treatments in a randomized, controlled trial.",Included
2628,"Determinant factors for sperm transfer and sperm storage within Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae) and impact on Sterile Insect Technique The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a method of pest control used in the management of Ceratitis capitata (Medfly). This technique is based on the mating and transfer of ejaculate sperm to the wild female population from released sterile males. This transfer will induce sterility in the female through sperm dominant lethal mutations. Consequently, the factors influencing sperm transfer and sperm storage are issues that must be understood to enable successful SIT implementation. Age, size, nutritional status, copula duration, and irradiation are the most important factors that affect sperm transfer and storage. Inconsistent results from studies investigating the influence of these factors on sperm transfer/storage may be due to, the strain of fly studied and variability in the sexual experience of the flies used. In this review, we highlight the interaction between these factors, issues that still need to be addressed, and propose future directions for the improvement of medfly males' sexual performance and the successful application of SIT against this pest.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

1404,"Determinants of Sunburn and Sun Protection of Agricultural Workers during Occupational and Recreational Activities Objective: The aim of this study was to identify determinants of occupational sunburn in agricultural workers and assess their occupational and recreational sun protection habits. Method(s): Specific surveys of agricultural workers in Switzerland and France were conducted (N=1538). Multivariate logistic regressions identified occupational sunburn determinants. Occupational and recreational sun protection habits were estimated and correlated. Result(s): One-year occupational and recreational sunburn prevalences were 19.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Occupational sunburn increased with having a recent recreational sunburn, highly sensitive skin, young age, high perceived skin cancer risk, using sunscreen, and not wearing a hat. Correlation between protection habits during work and leisure was substantial (r s 0.5 to 0.7). Skin health knowledge was high and pro-tanning attitude moderate. Conclusion(s): Potentially modifiable sunburn determinants and suboptimal recreational and occupational sun protection practices were identified in agricultural workers. Refining and tailoring sun protection messages targeting the agricultural sector are needed.© Copyright 2017 American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%. The survival rates within 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.7%, 51.6% and 41.9% respectively, which were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). However, the clinical group had significantly more 1st and 2nd degree myelosuppression and hand-foot syndrome. The symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment. Conclusion(s): Concurrent 3DCRT and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in the elderly patients greatly improved short-term efficacy and survival rate within 1, 2 and 3 years, while the toxic effects also increased greatly, but could be withstood by most patients.",Excluded

3118,"Mouse spleen lymphocyte bactericidal and peroxidase activities: enhancement by whole body x-irradiation A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included
2955,"The interobserver reliability of the diagnosis and classification of scaphoid fractures using high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT Aims Besides conventional radiographs, the use of MRI, CT, and bone scintigraphy is frequent in the diagnosis of a fracture of the scaphoid. However, which techniques give the best results remain unknown. The investigation of a new imaging technique initially requires an analysis of its precision. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the interobserver agreement of high-resolution peripheral quantitative CT (HR-pQCT) in the diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture. A secondary aim was to investigate the interobserver agreement for the presence of other fractures and for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Methods Two radiologists and two orthopaedic trauma surgeons evaluated HR-pQCT scans of 31 patients with a clinically-suspected scaphoid fracture. The observers were asked to determine the presence of a scaphoid or other fracture and to classify the scaphoid fracture based on the Herbert classification system. Fleiss kappa statistics were used to calculate the interobserver agreement for the diagnosis of a fracture. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess the agreement for the classification of scaphoid fracture. Results A total of nine (29%) scaphoid fractures and 12 (39%) other fractures were diagnosed in 20 patients (65%) using HR-pQCT across the four observers. The interobserver agreement was 91% for the identification of a scaphoid fracture (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.00) and 80% for other fractures (95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). The mean ICC for the classification of a scaphoid fracture in the seven patients diagnosed with scaphoid fracture by all four observers was 73% (95% CI 0.42 to 0.94). Conclusion We conclude that the diagnosis of scaphoid and other fractures is reliable when using HR-pQCT in patients with a clinically-suspected fracture.Copyright © 2020 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",Excluded
2235,"Asesment of lymphoid neoplasm risk factors in people ocupationaly exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation Objective: To estimate the incidence of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue (MNLT) among employees of the Siberian Chemical Combine (SC) occupationally exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

1122,"Superficial Femoral Artery Intervention by Single Transpedal Arterial Access BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic disease of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is frequently seen and can be treated with percutaneous interventions, traditionally via femoral artery access. There are limited reports of transpedal artery access for peripheral artery interventions, but none to date describing routine primary transpedal artery approach for SFA stenting. METHOD(S): In this preliminary study, we report 4 patients who underwent successful endovascular SFA stenting using a single transpedal artery access via a new ultra-low profile 6 Fr sheath (Glidesheath Slender; Terumo Corporation). RESULT(S): All patients underwent successful SFA stenting without complication. Procedure time varied from 51 to 72 minutes. The mean contrast amount used was 56 mL; mean fluoroscopy time was 21 minutes; mean radiation dose was 91 mGy. At 1-month follow-up, duplex ultrasonography showed that all pedal arteries had remained patent. CONCLUSION(S): Transpedal artery approach as a primary approach to SFA stenting appears feasible and safe. Comparative trials with standard percutaneous femoral approach are warranted.",Excluded
1290,"Safety, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of68Ga-OPS202 in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective phase I imaging study Preclinical and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that radiolabeled somatostatin (sst) receptor antagonists perform better than agonists in detecting neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). We performed a prospective phase I/II study to evaluate the sst receptor antagonist68Ga-OPS202 (68Ga-NODAGA-JR11; NODAGA 5 1,4,7-triazacyclononane, 1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid and JR11 5 Cpa-c(DCys-Aph(Hor)-DAph(Cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys)-DTyr-NH2)) for PET imaging. Here, we report the results of phase I of the study. Method(s): Patients received 2 single 150-MBq intravenous injections of68Ga-OPS202 3-4 wk apart (15 mg of peptide at visit 1 and 50 mg at visit 2). At visit 1, a dynamic PET/CT scan over the kidney was obtained during the first 30 min after injection, and static whole-body scans were obtained at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after injection; at visit 2, a static whole-body scan was obtained at 1 h. Blood samples and urine were collected at regular intervals to determine68Ga-OPS202 pharmacokinetics. Safety, biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and the most appropriate imaging time point for68Ga-OPS202 were assessed. Result(s): Twelve patients with well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs took part in the study.68Ga-OPS202 cleared rapidly from the blood, with a mean residence time of 2.4 6 1.1 min/L. The organs with the highest mean dose coefficients were the urinary bladder wall, kidneys, and spleen. The calculated effective dose was 2.4E2 02 6 0.2E202 mSv/MBq, corresponding to 3.6 mSv, for a reference activity of 150 MBq. Based on total numbers of detected malignant lesions, the optimal time window for the scan was between 1 and 2 h. For malignant liver lesions, the time point at which most patients had the highest mean tumor contrast was 1 h.68Ga-OPS202 was well tolerated; adverse events were grade 1 or 2, and there were no signals of concern from laboratory blood or urinalysis tests. Conclusion(s):68Ga-OPS202 showed favorable biodistribution and imaging properties, with optimal tumor contrast between 1 and 2 h after injection. Dosimetry analysis revealed that the dose delivered by68Ga-OPS202 to organs is similar to that delivered by other68Ga-labeled sst analogs. Further evaluation of68Ga-OPS202 for PET/CT imaging of NETs is therefore warranted.Copyright COPYRIGHT © 2018 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded
2184,"Clinical implementation of an emergency department coronary computed tomographic angiography protocol for triage of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of emergency department (ED) coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) during a 3-year clinical experience. Method(s): Single-center registry of coronary CTA in consecutive ED patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The primary outcome was efficiency of coronary CTA defined as the length of hospitalization. Secondary endpoints of safety were defined as the rate of downstream testing, normalcy rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), absence of missed ACS, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up, and index radiation exposure. Result(s): One thousand twenty two consecutive patients were referred for clinical coronary CTA with suspicion of ACS. Overall, median time to discharge home was 10.5 (5.7-24.1) hours. Patient disposition was 42.7 % direct discharge from the ED, 43.2 % discharge from emergency unit, and 14.1 % hospital admission. ACS rate during index hospitalization was 9.1 %. One hundred ninety two patients underwent additional diagnostic imaging and 77 underwent ICA. The positive predictive value of CTA compared to ICA was 78.9 % (95 %-CI 68.1-87.5 %). Median CT radiation exposure was 4.0 (2.5-5.8) mSv. No ACS was missed; MACE at follow-up after negative CTA was 0.2 %. Conclusion(s): Coronary CTA in an experienced tertiary care setting allows for efficient and safe management of patients with suspicion for ACS. Key points: * ED Coronary CTA using advanced systems is associated with low radiation exposure. * Negative coronary CTA is associated with low rates of MACE. * CTA in ED patients enables short median time to discharge home. * CTA strategy is characterized by few downstream tests including unnecessary ICA.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded

228,"Adaptation to motion sickness from torso rotation affects symptoms from supine head nodding INTRODUCTION: Space motion sickness affects more than 50% of astronauts. Adaptation to one kind of nauseogenic motion can affect the response to another. We hypothesized that repeated exposure to torso rotation (TR) would diminish motion sickness (MS) due to supine head nodding (HN), a ground-based analogue for space sickness., METHODS: During TR, standing subjects swept their gaze back and forth between two targets located 135 degrees to either side of straight ahead. For HN, the subject lay supine on a platform with his/her head and neck hanging over the edge. The head was pitched back and forth between the horizontal position and rotated back as far as possible. MS was quantified in 5 male and 20 female subjects using numerical estimates of discomfort and a more detailed questionnaire. Susceptibility to TR and HN was determined on three occasions for each stimulus. At least 1 mo separated any two tests. Subjects were exposed to TR once a day for 7 consecutive days 1 mo after the final control session. Within 24 h of the seventh session, and 1 mo later, susceptibility to HN was evaluated again., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in MS susceptibility during repeated exposure to TR (time to stop 17.7 min on Day 1, 31.8 min on Day 7). In contrast, there was a significant increase in MS susceptibility to HN after repeated exposure to TR (mean time to stop 11.7 min before TR, 9.5 min after). Susceptibility to HN was back to normal (time to stop 11.4 min) 1 mo later., DISCUSSION: Subjects can adapt to TR by repeated exposure. At the same time, susceptibility to HN increases. Strategies for pre-adaptation to space motion sickness need to be chosen carefully as they could actually be counterproductive.",Excluded

While the efficacy of PUVA with oral 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) is well documented, the use of its topical variation, bath-water PUVA therapy with 8-MOP has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of 8-MOP bath-water PUVA therapy in adult patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. We retrospectively evaluated the outcomes of bath-water delivery of 8-MOP (1 mg l(-1)) in 16 patients with early stage mycosis fungoides. In all patients complete response was achieved after a mean duration of 63 days requiring 29 treatments and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 33 J cm(-2). The time to relapse after complete clinical clearance was 45.6 (+/-9.2) weeks. In comparison, oral PUVA therapy with 8-MOP resulted in complete response after 64.5 days (25.8 treatments) with a mean relapse-free period of 30 (+/-3.5) weeks.

Materials/Methods: Wereviewed our experience in treating adult (age.18) patientswith a diagnosis ofmedulloblastoma. Information was gathered retrospectively on 66 patients who were seen at the time of initial diagnosis at our institution from1969 to 2008. Pathology was reviewed at the time of this analysis for all patients with available slides.Median age was 33. 44 patients hadM0 disease, 9 had M1, and 13were classified asMX.31 patientswere classified as high risk, 31 as standard risk and 4 patients had incomplete information for risk stratification. Classic histology was the most common type (n = 40) followed by desmoplastic (n = 9) and large cell/ anaplastic (n = 1). Radiation information was available in 64 patients. 61 received craniospinal radiotherapy (median dose 36 Gy) and 62 received posterior fossa radiotherapy (median total dose 55 Gy). 28 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy which was most commonly cisplatin based. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves.Any recurrence or deathwas counted as an event in the estimation of PFS. Cox regression analysiswas used to compare recurrences between different groups (only patients that recurred were counted as having an event). The effect of chemotherapy in different groups was also assessed. Result(s):Median follow-upwas 80months. The estimated 5-yearOS and PFSwas 74%and 59%, respectively.High risk classification was associatedwithworseOS (p= 0.03) and recurrence (HR2.56, p= 0.05) and trend forworse PFS(p= 0.1313). Five-yearOSand PFS was 61% and 49% for high-risk, compared to 86% and 69% for patients classified as standard risk. Gross total resection (GTR) was associatedwith an improvement inOS (p = 0.03) and a trend toward improved PFS (p = 0.09) compared to subtotal resection or biopsy. No significant differenceswere observed for gender, location (midline vs. lateral), radiation dose, histologic type, anaplasia extent, treatment era or use ofMRI for staging.No benefit for chemotherapy could be demonstrated for the group as a whole.

Conclusion(s): In adult patients with medulloblastoma, extent of resection and risk group are predictors of outcome. No significant difference in outcomes was observed by treatment era. These exploratory results suggest a possible benefit for chemotherapy in the group of high risk patients with classic histology.",Excluded
153,"Survival and complications following Gamma Knife radiosurgery or enucleation for ocular melanoma: A 20-year experience Background We present our experience in treating ocular melanoma at theNational Centre for Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Sheffield, UK over the last 20 years. Method We analysed 170 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, recorded the evolution of visual acuity and complication rates, and compared their survival with 620 patients treated with eye enucleation. Different peripheral doses (using the 50% therapeutic isodose) were employed: 50-70 Gy for 24 patients, 45 Gy for 71 patients, 35 Gy for 62 patients. Findings There was no significant difference in survival between the 35-Gy, 45-Gy and 50- to 70-Gy groups when compared between themselves (p00.168) and with the enucleation group (p00.454). The 5-year survival rates were: 64% for 35 Gy, 62.71% for 45 Gy, 63.6% for 50-70 Gy and 65.2% for enucleated patients. Clinical variables influencing survival for radiosurgery patients were tumour volume (p00.014) and location (median 66.4 vs 37.36 months for juxtapapillary vs peripheral tumours, respectively; p00.001), while age and gender did not prove significant. Regarding complications, using 35 Gy led to more than a 50% decrease, when compared with the 45-Gy dose, in the incidence of cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Retinopathy, optic neuropathy and vitreous haemorrhage were not significantly influenced. Blindness decreased dramatically from 83.7% for 45 Gy to 31.4% for 35 Gy (p00.006), as well as postradiosurgery enucleation: 23.9% for 45 Gy vs 6.45% for 35 Gy (p00.018). Visual acuity, recorded up to 5 years postradiosurgery, was significantly better preserved for 35 Gy than for 45 Gy (p00.0003).

3337,"Combined Effects of Three High-Energy Charged Particle Beams Important for Space Flight on Brain, Behavioral and Cognitive Endpoints in B6D2F1 Female and Male Mice The radiation environment in deep space includes the galactic cosmic radiation with different proportions of all naturally occurring ions from protons to uranium. Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included

Fifty-seven patients were scanned using both ATVS and ATCM and images were reconstructed using either filtered back-projection (FBP) (group A1) or sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) (group A2). Forty-eight patients were imaged using only ATCM, with a fixed tube potential of 120 kVp and FBP reconstruction (group B). Quantitative parameters (image noise in Hounsfield unit and contrast-to-noise ratio of the aorta, the liver, and the hepatic tumors) and qualitative visual parameters (image noise, overall image quality, and lesion conspicuity as graded on a 5-point scale) were compared among the groups., RESULTS: Group A2 scanned with the automatically chosen 80 kVp and 100 kVp tube voltages ranked the best in lesion conspicuity and subjective and objective image quality (p values ranging from < 0.001 to 0.004) among the three groups, except for overall image quality between group A2 and group B (p = 0.022).

The radiation dose in group A was 19% lower than that in group B (p = 0.022)., CONCLUSION: CT scanning with combined use of ATVS and ATCM and image reconstruction with SAFIRE algorithm provides higher lesion conspicuity and better image quality for evaluating small hepatic HCCs with radiation dose reduction.",Excluded
3075,"Comparison of effective radiation dose between low-and conventional-dose protocols in patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography: A randomized blinded comparison Background: Radiation exposure to the patient during coronary angiography or intervention is relatively high and considered to be potentially harmful. However, there is little data about the reduction strategy of radiation hazard. Purpose(s):We intended to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of low dose radiation protocols compared to current conventional dose protocols in the patients during diagnostic coronary angiography. Method(s): From February 2015 to October 2015, one hundred three consecutive patients (66.2+/-12.3 years old, 46 women (44.7%) who undertook diagnostic coronary angiography using Artis zeeTM angiography system were enrolled. After randomization of low- or conventional radiation dose protocols (LDP versus CDP), The patient underwent coronary angiography according to the standard angiography method (AP-Caudal, RAO-caudal, RAO-cranial, and LAO-cranial views of each 30 degrees, and spider view of 50 degrees and 30 degrees). The LDP consists of 10 frame rate (FR) per second during fluoroscopy and 40% reduced dose of conventional dose during cineangiography. The radial approach was used in all the procedures. We analyzed and compared the dose-area product (DAP: muGy m2), air-kerma (AK: mGy), exposure time (seconds), and FR between the LDP and CDP group. Result(s): Firstly, there is no significant interference to evaluate the coronary artery status by eyeball estimation between both groups. There are no significant basic demographics between the groups including age, body mass index or waist circumferences. Body weight is well correlated with the level of DAP and AK (gamma=0.27, p=0.006 and gamma=0.29, p=0.008 respectively). Marvelously, there are markedly reduction of effective radiation dose in the LDP group compared to CDP group (DAP, 1087.8+/-612.5 vs. 2188.2+/-949.4 muGy m2; AK, 171.5+/-111.6 vs. 348.1+/-178.3 mGy, p<0.001) by Mann-Whitney test, while on the similar total radiation exposure time (50.7+/-21.1 vs. 52.0+/-19.6 sec, p=0.739), FR (662.2+/-197.0 vs. 685.6+/-211.1, p=0.695), and image counts (10.1+/-2.0 vs. 10.7+/-3.5 images) by student t-test. Conclusion(s): The use of low dose radiation protocol was associated with nearly half amount reduction in exposure to patients undergoing diagnostic angiography without any significant loss of diagnostic information by eyeball estimation. It might provide another strategy to protect the patients and medical workers from potential radiation hazard in the catheterization room. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
339,"Prediction of survival by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy: results of the ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 trial In this prospective National Cancer Institute-funded American College of Radiology Imaging Network/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cooperative group trial, we hypothesized that standardized uptake value (SUV) on post-treatment [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) correlates with survival in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded

Materials: The medical charts of 17 patients with paranasal or nasal cavity malignancies treated by robotic radiosurgery (RRS)+/- external beam radiotherapy were assessed in this retrospective study. Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions). Those 2 patients had also serious ipsilate ral facial pain requiring narcotic analgesics, and they also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with no need of surgical debridement. No visual acuity loss was observed during follow-up. Minor bleeding, which was spontaneously stopped, was seen in one patient. Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgery seems to be an alternative and tolerable therapeutic option either in recurrent or primary paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies. However, longer follow-up periods are required to see the safety of RRS particulary in terms of late effects.",Excluded

2865,"A prospective study comparing the predictions of doctors versus models for treatment outcome of lung cancer patients: a step toward individualized care and shared decision making BACKGROUND: Decision Support Systems, based on statistical prediction models, have the potential to change the way medicine is being practiced, but their application is currently hampered by the astonishing lack of impact studies. Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models., PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis., RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models., CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice. Identification of risk groups on the basis of the models facilitates individualized treatment, and should be further investigated in clinical impact studies. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to report our results of collected patient outcomes from a single center's large experience using HBOT to treat maxillary bone ORN. Method(s): From 1999 to 2015, 21 patients received treatment for maxillary bone ORN at our center. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for the following variables: age, sex, comorbidities, tumor stage and site, previous surgery, previous radiotherapy or chemoradiation therapy, HBOT data, response to treatment and further management. Result(s): A positive clinical outcome from HBOT occurred in 85.7% of patients with ORN and was proven radiologically in 14 of 15 patients (93.3%). In 5 patients, reconstructive surgery was required thereafter. Conclusion(s): Controversy exists regarding the management of ORN of the maxillofacial skeleton.

1530,"Head and neck angiography at 70 kVp with a third-generation dual-source CT system in patients: comparison with 100 kVp Purpose: This study was conducted in order to evaluate the image quality of 70 kVp and 25 mL contrast medium (CM) volume for head and neck computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and assess the diagnostic accuracy for arterial stenosis. Method(s): Fifty patients were prospectively divided into two groups randomly: group A (n = 25), 70 kVp with 25 mL CM, and group B (n = 25), 100 kVp with 40 mL CM. CT attenuation values, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries were measured for objective image quality. Subjective image quality of the shoulder and cerebral arteries was also evaluated. For patients undergoing digital subtracted angiography (DSA), diagnostic accuracy of CTA was assessed with DSA as reference standard. Result(s): The SNRs of the shoulder, neck, and cerebral arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). The CNRs of the shoulder and neck arteries in group A were higher than those in group B (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in subjective image quality of arteries between group A and group B (P > 0.05). The accuracy was noted as 94.0% (156/166) in group A and 97.1% (134/138) in group B for >= 50% stenosis. The accuracy of intracranial arterial stenosis was lower than that of extracranial arterial stenosis in group A. The radiation dose of group A was significantly decreased by 56% than that of group B. Conclusion(s): Head and neck CTA at 70 kVp using 25 mL CM can obtain diagnostic image quality with lower radiation dose while maintaining high accuracy in detecting the arterial stenosis compared with the 100-kVp and 40-mL CM.Copyright © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Excluded

Axial length was measured with an optical biometer. Subjects completed a questionnaire on device preferences., RESULTS: The SVOne seated intrasession reproducibility coefficient (RPC) was 0.37 diopters (D), while the Netra's was 0.41 D. Intersession seated results were: RPC = 0.67 D for the SVOne and RPC = 0.54 D for the Netra. The average seated to prone LBPP differences were significantly different from zero for both the SVOne and Netra. The SVOne was preferred in four out of five categories on the questionnaire and took half the time to complete a measurement set compared to the Netra., DISCUSSION: Users preferred the SVOne and it took less time. An SVOne refraction change of 0.67 D from baseline would happen by chance less than 5% of the time. If multiple separate measurements were taken, the detection limit could be reduced (e.g., three repeated measurements could reduce it to 0.38 D). Since astronauts with visual changes show spherical equivalent changes of 0.5 to 1.0 D, in-flight autorefractors could help determine the time course of refractive changes in space from which changes in axial length could be inferred.Masterova KS, Anderson AP, Cowan DR, Fellows AM, Zegans ME, Buckey JC.

1746,"Proton pump inhibitor use and risk of community-acquired Clostridium difficile-associated disease defined by prescription for oral vancomycin therapy BACKGROUND: The association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is controversial. In this study we re-examined a previously reported association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the development of community-acquired CDAD, this time using an alternative case definition of the disease., METHODS: We performed a case-control study of community-acquired CDAD using a United Kingdom clinical research database. Patients receiving oral vancomycin therapy were identified as having CDAD, the only indication for this drug. Each case subject was matched with up to 10 control subjects. Neither the cases nor the controls had been admitted to hospital in the year before the date of the vancomycin prescription (index date). Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for key covariates., RESULTS: We identified 317 cases of community-acquired CDAD treated with oral vancomycin therapy and 3167 matched control subjects. Exposure to a proton pump inhibitor in the 90 days before the index date was associated with an increased risk of CDAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.2). Antibiotic exposure in the 90 days before the index date was also a significant risk factor for community-acquired CDAD (OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.1- 11.0), even though 45% of the case subjects had not received a prescription for an antibiotic during that period. Certain comorbidities, in particular renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant disease, as well as prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, were also associated with an increased risk., INTERPRETATION: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired CDAD, when cases were defined by receipt of prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure was also a significant risk factor, but a significant proportion of the patients with community-acquired CDAD had no such exposure.",Excluded
2143,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included
2907,"Functional Preservation after Planned Partial Resection Followed by Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Large Vestibular Schwannomas Objective The treatment goal for vestibular schwannomas (VS) has been changed from total removal of the tumor to functional preservation with long-term tumor growth control. The small- to medium-sized VS can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but large VS require surgical decompression for the relief of cerebellar dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure. We have been performing planned partial surgical resections followed by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for large VS. Here, we evaluate a recent series of such cases from the standpoint of functional outcomes. Methods From January 2000 to May 2013, we treated 40 patients with large unilateral VS (maximum tumor diameter at least 25 mm) with planned partial tumor removal followed by GKS for functional preservation. The median maximum diameter of the tumors was 32.5 mm (range 25-52 mm). All patients underwent surgery via the retrosigmoid approach, and tumors situated on the ventral and in the internal auditory canal intentionally were not removed, thus preserving cranial nerve functions. GKS was performed 1-12 months after surgical resection (median interval 3 months). The median tumor volume at GKS was 3.3 cm3 (range 0.4-10.4 cm3) and the median prescribed dose was 12 Gy (range 10-12 Gy). The median follow-up period after GKS was 65 months (18-156 months). Results At the final follow-up, facial nerve preservation (House-Brackmann grade I-II) was achieved in 38 patients (95%; House-Brackmann grade I: 92.5%, II: 2.5%). Among the 14 patients with preoperative pure tone average (PTA) less than 50 dB, 6 of them (42.9%) maintained PTA less than 50 dB at the last follow-up. Two patients improved from severe hearing loss to PTA less than 50 dB (1 patient after surgery and 1 patient one and half years after GKS). Five- and 10-year tumor growth control occurred in 86% of patients. Four patients (10%) required salvage surgery; the predictive factor was tumor volume greater than 6 cm3 at GKS (P = 0.01). Conclusions Planned partial removal of large VS followed by GKS achieved a high rate of facial nerve and hearing preservation. To achieve long-term tumor growth control, the tumor volume at GKS after planned partial surgical resection should be smaller than 6 cm3. Our results revealed that patients with hearing preservation postoperatively have a chance of maintaining hearing function, even though the possibility exists of deterioration by long-term follow-up after surgical intervention and GKS. Furthermore, some patients with severe hearing loss before treatment have the chance of hearing improvement, even those with large VS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2127,"The use of an air bubble curtain to reduce the received sound levels for harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) In December 2005 construction work was started to replace a harbor wall in Kerteminde harbor, Denmark.

During the same period three harbor porpoises were housed in a marine mammal facility on the opposite side of the harbor. All animals showed strong avoidance reactions after the start of the piling activities. As a measure to reduce the sound exposure for the animals an air bubble curtain was constructed and operated in a direct path between the piling site and the opening of the animals' semi-natural pool. The sound attenuation effect achieved with this system was determined by quantitative comparison of pile driving impulses simultaneously measured in front of and behind the active air bubble curtain. Mean levels of sound attenuation over a sequence of 95 consecutive pile strikes were 14 dB (standard deviation (s.d.) 3.4 dB) for peak to peak values and 13 dB (s.d. 2.5 dB) for SEL values.

The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included

The study hypothesis stated that sonographic imaging of the AIIS correlates well to AIIS morphology seen on false profile radiographs. METHOD(S): Fifty-three hips in 30 consecutive patients met the inclusion criteria. A single, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeon performed an ultrasound on all of the patients to evaluate the AIIS morphology. The patients underwent standing false profile radiographs. The US and radiographic images were independently reviewed and classified according to Hetsroni classification of AIIS morphology by two senior, fellowship trained, orthopedic surgeons. Agreement between the two raters was calculated for each imaging modality (inter-rater agreement) as well as the agreement between the rating in each modality by the same rater (""inter-method"" agreement). RESULT(S): The agreement between the raters (inter-rater agreement) for morphologic evaluation of the AIIS by means of FP view was 88.8% (p<0.001) and that by means of US was 81.5%(p<0.001).

The analysis of cosmonauts' response times showed that the mental rotation task is not greatly impaired in weightlessness.

1068,"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cutaneous radiation syndrome Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery.

Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included

Aim(s): To assess the pathologic features and determinants of osteosarcoma in patients of the Indian subcontinent that would put an insight into its appearance and behavior. Methods and Material: Forty cases of biopsy proven osteosarcoma were selected over a period of three years. Histopathology was done for tumor typing, along with serology (pre and post-operative serum alkaline phosphatase). In all cases TNM staging and immunohistochemistry for antibodies to Osteonectin (ON) (diagnosis), S100 (differentiation), Ki 67 and Her2 (prognosis) was done. Result(s): Serum alkaline phosphatase was high in 37 (92%) cases initially and remained high in metastatic and recurrent lesions. Osteonectin was positive in 38 (95%) cases, S100 in 31 (77%), Ki 67 showed overlapping labeling indices between 4.8-18.8% and Her2 showed more positivity in higher stage tumors. Conclusion(s): Biopsy (along with imaging) is mandatory to diagnose osteosarcoma. Osteonectin is a good immunohistochemical marker to differentiate osteosarcoma from its mimics. For prognostication, serum alkaline phosphatase, post chemotherapy tumor necrosis (more than 90%), lack of Her2 expression are good parameters. S100 and Ki67 were found to have limited role in diagnosis and prognosis of osteosarcoma.Copyright © 2014 Ibn Sina Trust. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2841,"Percutaneous Computed Tomography-Guided Lung Biopsies using a Virtual Navigation Guidance: Our Experience OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a virtual CT-guided navigation system (Sirio-MASMEC Biomed) in performing lung biopsies, with greater attention to lesions smaller than 1 cm, compared to the traditional procedure., METHODS: This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of our Institute. Two hundred patients were prospectively selected. Of these, 100 were subjected to percutaneous procedure with the use of Sirio and 100 to traditional CT-guided percutaneous procedure. The two methods were compared in terms of absorbed dose, procedure time, complications, and number of non-diagnostic specimens (diagnostic success)., RESULTS: Sirio has shown a significant reduction in the absorbed dose and procedure times (p < 0.05), with a lower incidence of complications compared to the traditional procedure. Sirio has also allowed to carry out biopsies of lesions' diameter <=10 mm, obtaining fewer non diagnostic specimens thus resulting more effective in terms of diagnostic success., CONCLUSIONS: The use of Sirio in sampling biopsy showed a statistically significant reduction in terms of performed scans and procedural time with lower incidence of post-procedural complications compared to the traditional percutaneous procedure, especially for lesions <=10 mm. The best diagnostic result, the reduction of the dose absorbed and procedural complications makes the procedures more reliable, safety and less invasive. In addition, the reduction of execution time will increase the number of daily interventional procedures improving clinical management.",Excluded
42,"Back-scattered electron imaging and elemental analysis of retrieved bone tissue following sinus augmentation with deproteinized bovine bone or biphasic calcium phosphate OBJECTIVES: To compare resorption of a synthetic biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) bone-graft substitute with deproteinized bovine bone (DBB) used for human maxillary sinus augmentation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients underwent bilateral maxillary sinus floor augmentation with DBB in one side and a BCP (40%beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) and 60% hydroxyapatite) in the contralateral side. Simultaneously, with the augmentation on each side a microimplant was placed vertically from the top of the alveolar crest penetrating the residual bone and the grafting material. Eight months after initial surgery the microimplants were retrieved with a surrounding bone core. The composition of residual graft material and surrounding bone was analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy., RESULTS: Residual graft material of both types was present as 10-500 mum particles in direct contact with, or completely surrounded by, newly formed bone; smaller particles were also present in non-mineralized tissue. In the case of BCP the bone-graft substitute interface showed evidence of superficial disintegration of particles into individual grains. Median Ca/P ratios (at.%), determined from >200 discreet sites within residual graft particles and adjacent bone, were: DBB: 1.61 (confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.64); BCP: 1.5 (CI 1.45-1.52); DBB-augmented bone: 1.62 (CI 1.59-1.66); BCP-augmented bone: 1.52 (CI 1.47-1.55); P=0.028 for DBB vs. BCP and DBB- vs. BCP-augmented bone. The reduction in Ca/P ratio for BCP over the healing period is consistent with the dissolution of beta-TCP and reprecipitation on the surface of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite., CONCLUSION: The beta-TCP component of BCP may be gradually substituted by calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite over the healing period. This process and superficial degranulation of BCP particles may influence the progress of resorption and healing.",Excluded
2279,"p53 expression in human rectal tissue after radiotherapy: upregulation in normal mucosa versus functional loss in rectal carcinomas PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included
1636,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

2310,"Falling back to earth: Altered splanchnic vasoreactivity may contribute to microgravity-induced orthostatic intolerance The adaptations of the human cardiovascular system to microgravity, which are well tolerated while in space, can lead to dizziness, blurred vision, and fainting upon reentry. Specifically, orthostatic hypotension, a fall in blood pressure upon standing, poses a major problem for astronauts returning to Earth, and presents a hazard should an emergency ever arise during landing. Female astronauts are affected more frequently than males, suggesting underlying gender-related differences in cardiovascular regulation. One such difference has already been demonstrated: in response to an orthostatic challenge, males experience blood pooling primarily in the legs, while females show much more blood pooling in the abdominal region. Normally, the splanchnic blood vessels should reflexively constrict, initiating mobilization of the blood to supply the brain. In order to determine whether attenuation of this reflex is responsible for post-flight orthostatic intolerance (particularly in females), we examined in vitro vascular reactivity in male and female rats subjected to simulated microgravity (hind-limb unloading; HLU). The constrictor response of third-order mesenteric blood vessels to phenylephrine was measured by wire myograph. The sensitivity of female arteries to phenylephrine was attenuated following HLU. Maximal tensile response to phenylephrine was unchanged in these vessels, while maximal tensile response to high KCI increased. In male arteries, HLU did not significantly change any of these parameters. These results indicate that, after HLU, the mesenteric arteries of females (but not males) can be expected to show reduced sensitivity to noradrenergic sympathetic outflow. This may partially underlie the gender disparity in post-flight orthostatic hypotension.",Excluded
879,"Radiation exposure in total ankle replacement BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging procedures is associated with increased cancer risk. No published data currently exist regarding ionizing radiation exposure in total ankle replacement surgery. This study quantified intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration during ankle replacement surgery and examined patient and technical factors affecting the level of exposure., METHODS: Fifty-five patients underwent ankle replacement using STAR, Salto-Talaris, or INBONE total ankles. Intraoperative fluoroscopic dose and duration, patient demographics, implant design, and accompanying additional procedures were documented for each case. The relationship between each relevant variable and radiation dose and time was determined., RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopic dose and duration for all cases were 1.15 +/- 0.84 milliGray per case and 77 +/- 34 seconds per case, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the absorbed radiation dose and the duration of fluoroscopy (r = .50, P < .001). The mean fluoroscopic doses were 1.53 milliGray, 0.99 milliGray, and 0.88 milliGray for INBONE, STAR, and Salto-Talaris prostheses, respectively. Fluoroscopic dose was significantly influenced by implant design (P = .035), with implants using an intramedullary referencing guide associated with higher radiation doses. After excluding cases requiring additional procedures, the fluoroscopic time and radiation dose associated with intramedullary referencing guide implants continued to exceed those of the other implants, but the differences were no longer statistically significant (P = .22, P = .09, respectively)., CONCLUSION: The average patient radiation dose during total ankle replacement was approximately one-fifth the recommended maximum yearly radiation exposure. The radiation dose was positively associated with fluoroscopy duration. Among factors controllable by the surgeon, selection of an implant with an extramedullary alignment system and conscious effort to minimize duration of fluoroscopy can reduce harmful radiation exposure and decrease cancer risk in total ankle replacement patients and associated operating room personnel., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, comparative series.

1515,"Gamma Knife surgery for clival epidural-osseous dural arteriovenous fistulas OBJECTIVE Clival epidural-osseous dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is often associated with a large nidus, multiple arterial feeders, and complex venous drainage. In this study the authors report the outcomes of clival epidural-osseous DAVFs treated using Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS Thirteen patients with 13 clival epidural-osseous DAVFs were treated with GKS at the authors' institution between 1993 and 2015. Patient age at the time of GKS ranged from 38 to 76 years (median 55 years). Eight DAVFs were classified as Cognard Type I, 4 as Type IIa, and 1 as Type IIa+b. The median treatment volume was 17.6 cm3 (range 6.2-40.3 cm3). The median prescribed margin dose was 16.5 Gy (range 15-18 Gy). Clinical and radiological follow-ups were performed at 6-month intervals. Patient outcomes after GKS were categorized as 1) complete improvement, 2) partial improvement, 3) stationary, and 4) progression. RESULTS All 13 patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement, and on catheter angiography 12 of the 13 patients had complete obliteration and 1 patient had partial obliteration. The median follow-up period was 26 months (range 14-186 months). The median latency period from GKS to obliteration was 21 months (range 8-186 months). There was no intracranial hemorrhage during the follow-up period, and no deaths occurred. Two adverse events were observed following treatment, and 2 patients required repeat GKS treatment with eventual complete obliteration. CONCLUSIONS Gamma Knife surgery offers a safe and effective primary or adjuvant treatment modality for complex clival epidural-osseous DAVFs. All patients in this case series demonstrated symptomatic improvement, and almost all patients attained complete obliteration.Copyright © AANS, 2018.",Excluded
27,"Can both cruciate ligaments be preserved in knee arthroplasty? Eight- to nine-year follow-up of a bicompartmental knee replacement Preservation of native knee anatomy may confer improved patient satisfaction, as suggested by patient satisfaction scores in unicondylar versus total knee replacement. Bicompartmental knee replacement (BKR) implants similarly promote native tissue preservation. We retrospectively reviewed 42 consecutive patients who underwent BKR from 2006 to 2007. Outcome measures were evaluated. At an average follow-up of 103 months (range 87-110), 34/42 (81%) of implants survived. Among the retained implants, the Knee Society Score (KSS) grade was excellent in 26/34 (76.5%), good in 5/34 (14.7%), fair in 3/34 (8.8%), and poor in 0/34 (0%) of cases. Midterm results of BKR demonstrated 81% survival and 76% with excellent KSS grading. Despite a 20% revision rate at the short-term follow-up, the retained implants functioned well at the midterm follow-up.Copyright © 2016 by Begell House, Inc.",Excluded
455,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included
1623,"Collaboration of homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining factors for the survival and integrity of mice and cells Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) are mechanistically distinct DNA repair pathways that contribute substantially to double-strand break (DSB) repair in mammalian cells. We have combined mutations in factors from both repair pathways, the HR protein Rad54 and the DNA-end-binding factor Ku80, which has a role in NHEJ. Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice were severely compromised in their survival, such that fewer double mutants were born than expected, and only a small proportion of those born reached adulthood. However, double-mutant mice died at lower frequency from tumors than Ku80 single mutant mice, likely as a result of rapid demise at a young age from other causes. When challenged with an exogenous DNA damaging agent, ionizing radiation, double-mutant mice were exquisitely sensitive to low doses. Tissues and cells from double-mutant mice also showed indications of spontaneous DNA damage. Testes from some Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) mice displayed enhanced apoptosis and reduced sperm production, and embryonic fibroblasts from Rad54(-/-)Ku80(-/-) animals accumulated foci of gamma-H2AX, a marker for DSBs. The substantially increased DNA damage response in the double mutants implies a cooperation of the two DSB repair pathways for survival and genomic integrity in the animal.",Excluded
372,"Low-dose MDCT and CT enterography of patients with crohn disease: Feasibility of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in the evaluation of Crohn disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Forty-eight patients (20 men, 28 women; mean age, 33.3 years; range, 17-83 years) with known or suspected Crohn disease who underwent low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with ASIR between December 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients had previously undergone standard-dose 64-MDCT and CT enterography with filtered back projection (FBP), and those images were used for comparison. The weight-based IV contrast protocol and scan parameters (120 kVp, 5-mm section thickness, 0.5-second rotation, pitch of 1.375, 64 x 0.625 mm detector configuration) were constant for the two techniques except for a higher noise index (x1.3) in the ASIR group. Two blinded readers reviewed 75 randomized MDCT-CT enterographic scans of 48 patients to assess image quality and diagnostic performance in the evaluation of Crohn disease, and the radiation dose for the studies was estimated. RESULTS. All 75 MDCT and CT enterographic scans had acceptable quality for diagnostic interpretation. Findings of Crohn disease were seen on 63 of 75 scans (84%). Low-dose scans in the ASIR group had optimal image quality and were rated comparable to or better than standard-dose FBP images (mean score, 4.2 vs 3.87; p = 0.007). The subjective image noise score (mean, 1.43 vs 1.58; p = 0.2) and objective image noise measurements were lower for ASIR images (p < 0.001). Low-dose studies with ASIR allowed average dose reduction of 34.5% compared with standard-dose scans with FBP (volume CT dose index for ASIR, 7.7 +/- 2.1 mGy; for FBP, 12 +/- 5.5 mGy; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT and CT enterographic studies reconstructed with ASIR were of appropriate quality for confident evaluation of the manifestations of Crohn disease while allowing approximately 34% dose reduction in comparison with FBP technique. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
366,"A Pilot Study of Safer Radiation Dosage to the Heart and Its Subregions Background and Objectives: The real impact of ionizing radiation on the heart and poorer overall survival for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the safe dose constraints to the heart's subregions that could prevent patients' early non-cancerous death and improve their quality of life. Methods and Materials: A retrospective cohort study was performed containing 51 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and treated using 3D, Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy. For a dosimetric analysis, these structures were chosen: heart, heart base (HB), and region of great blood vessels (GBV). Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were recorded for all mentioned structures. Maximum and mean doses to the heart, HB, the muscle mass of the HB, and GBV were obtained. V10-V60 (%) parameters were calculated from the DVH. After performed statistical analysis, logistic regression models were created, and critical doses calculated. Result(s): The critical dose for developing a fatal endpoint for HB was 30.5 Gy, while for GBV, it was 46.3 Gy. Increasing the average dose to the HB or GBV by 1 Gy from the critical dose further increases the possibility of early death by 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We suggest that the non-canonical sub-regions of the heart (HB and GBV) should be considered during the planning stage. Additional constraints of the heart subregions should be chosen accordingly, and we propose that the mean doses to these regions be 30.5 Gy and 46.3 Gy, respectively, or less. Extrapolated DVH curves for both regions may be used during the planning stage with care.",Excluded
1863,"Iodine-131 treatment and chromosomal damage: in vivo dose-effect relationship Although it is well known that radiation induces chromosomal aberrations, there is a lack of information on the in vivo dose-effect relationship in patients receiving iodine-131 treatment, and the results of previous studies are controversial. In this study, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) method was employed to investigate acute and late chromosomal damage (CD) in the peripheral lymphocytes of 15 patients who received various doses of (131)I (259-3,700 MBq), either for thyrotoxicosis (TTX) or for ablation treatment in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The SCE frequencies in cultured peripheral lymphocytes were determined before treatment (to assess basal SCE frequencies), on the 3rd day (to assess acute SCE frequencies) and 6 months later (to assess late SCE frequencies). The basal, acute and late SCE frequencies (mean+/-SD) were 3.19+/-0.93, 10.83+/-1.72 and 5.75+/-2.06, respectively, in the whole group, and these values differed significantly from each other ( P<0.001). In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of the present data and a comparative analysis with the results of previous studies reported in the literature, we defined acute and late effects using a ""damage ratio"" (DR) and a ""recovery ratio"" (RR), based on the basal, acute and late data for individual patients. No statistically significant difference was found in the DR between DTC and TTX patients (76.4%+/-11.5% vs 67.6%+/-9.0%), while the mean RR was higher in TTX patients than in the DTC group (75.2%+/-24.4% vs 36.8%+/-13.7%). The DR on the 3rd day was not related to the administered (131)I dose in the whole group, but a negative correlation was found between the (131)I dose and the RR at the 6th month (r=-0.60, P=0.04). The best fit for this relationship was obtained by a linear-quadratic model, as y=104.89x-28.4x(2)+38.1 ( R(2)=0.51, P=0.04). On the other hand, comparative analysis with the results of previous studies with comparable sampling times revealed that the best fit for the relationships between the administered dose of (131)I and DR and RR were obtained with a linear-quadratic model (Y=alpha D+beta D(2)) rather than a linear one. However, there was an interesting difference in comparison with in vitro studies, in that we found the coefficient beta to have a negative value, suggesting the disappearance of damaged lymphocytes from the peripheral circulation in a dose-dependent manner following (131)I treatment. Further studies are therefore needed to clarify the effect of the negative beta value on the biological dosimetry approach in continuous internal low LET radiation, as in the case of (131)I treatment.",Excluded
96,"Analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq).

The median AVM volume treated was 12.7 cm(3), and 18 Gy was the median margin dose., RESULTS: Functional image integration of MEG improved the recognition of critical brain structures adjacent to the AVM. This facilitated anatomical planning designed to reduce the dose to adjacent critical structures while maintaining a therapeutic dose to the AVM target.

Twenty patients were treated preoperatively, five did not receive surgery. Twenty-three patients received concomitant chemotherapy with oral capecitabine. A comparison with a cohort of twenty patients with similar characteristics treated with conformal therapy (3DC) is presented as well. Result(s): From a dosimetric point of view, RA improved conformality of doses (CI95% = 1.1 vs. 1.4 for RA and 3DC), presented similar target coverage with lower maximum doses, significant sparing of femurs and significant reduction of integral and mean dose to healthy tissue. From the clinical point of view, surgical reports resulted in a down-staging in 41% of cases. Acute toxicity was limited to Grade 1-2 diarrhoea in 40% and Grade 3 in 8% of RA pts, 45% and 5% of 3DC pts, compatible with known effects of concomitant chemotherapy. RA treatments were performed with an average of 2.0 vs. 3.4 min of 3DC. Conclusion(s): RA proved to be a safe, qualitatively advantageous treatment modality for rectal cancer, showing some improved results in dosimetric aspects. © 2010 Richetti et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2652,"[Occurrence of immune hyperthyroidism after radioiodine therapy of autonomous goiter] AIM: The goal of the study was to examine the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 treatment of autonomous goiter with special regard to pretreatment scintigraphic patterns., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Pre- and posttreatment in-vitro and in-vivo parameters were studied in 375 consecutive patients treated with I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. All patients included were within ambulant control for at least 2.5 months following treatment. According to the pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scan 59% (220/375) had multifocal (MF), 23% (86/375) unifocal (UF), 10% (38/375) mixed focal-disseminated (FD) and 8% (31/375) disseminated (D) scintigraphic patterns., RESULTS: In 93.9% (352/375), the autonomous tissue was totally, in 2.1% (8/375) partially and in 1.6% (6/375) insufficiently eliminated. In 2.4% (9/375) a relapse of hyperthyroidism was observed 2 to 10 months following I-131 therapy. In 8 patients a relapse of hyperthyroidism was accompanied or followed by an elevation of the previously non-elevated TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level and in 1 patient by an TRAb increase to the upper borderline range implicating Graves' disease. With the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy a statistically significant difference in pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphic patterns was found: 0% of unifocal (0/86) or multifocal (0/220), however 18% (7/38) of focal-disseminated and 7% (2/31) of disseminated scintigraphic patterns. From the 366 patients without relapse of hyperthyroidism 2 (MF) had elevated pre- and posttreatment TRAb levels and 3 (D) had elevated TRAb levels for the first time after I-131 therapy., CONCLUSION: There is a low overall prevalence (2.4%) of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. However, the prevalence of posttreatment Graves' disease is highly dependent upon pretreatment scintigraphic patterns exhibiting focal-disseminated or disseminated patterns.",Excluded
732,"Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Patients and Methods: Between August 2003 and December 2007, 47 patients were treated, 29 men and 18 women, with a mean age of 33.4 years (range 2167 yrs) and a mean stone size of 31.5mm (range 2446mm). All stones were located in the renal pelvis with mild to moderate hydronephrosis seen on intravenous urography. A ureteral stent was inserted cystoscopically, and saline was injected for more localization of the pelvicaliceal system (PCS), if needed. Puncture of the PCS was performed with an 18-gauge nephrostomy needle through the lower pole calyx, and all the stages, including dilatation, were performed under ultrasonography guidance. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients were stone free in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder the day after the operation. Five patients had multiple fragments that measured about 4 to 5mm, which passed in 4 weeks (total stone-free rate: 93.61%); failure occurred in two patients, and fluoroscopy was needed; two patients who had residual fragments that measured 10 and 12mm underwent shockwave lithotripsy; and in one patient, a fragment that measured 7 to 8mm migrated into the ureterit fragmented and was removed with a ureteroscope 2 days after the operation. Conclusion(s): PCNL using sonography is a good alternative to the fluoroscopic method. It is performed without radiation exposure to the surgeon and patient; however, more experience is needed.

3069,"Chemoradiotherapy for extrahepatic bile duct cancer with gross residual disease after surgery Background: The purpose of the present study was to analyze the outcome of chemoradiotherapy for extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD) cancer patients with gross residual disease after surgical resection. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 30 patients with EHBD adenocarcinoma who underwent chemoradiotherapy after palliative resection (R2 resection). Postoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the tumor bed including residual tumor and regional lymph nodes (range=40-55.8 Gy). Most patients underwent chemoradiotherapy concurrently with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. Result(s): The 2-year locoregional progression-free, distant metastasis-free and overall survival rates were 33.3%, 42.4% and 44.5%, respectively. High radiation dose >=50 Gy had a marginally significant impact on superior locoregional progression-free survival compared to 40 Gy (p=0.081). One patient developed grade 3 late gastrointestinal toxicity. Conclusion(s): Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for EHBD cancer patients with gross residual disease after surgery was well-tolerated. There could be a chance for durable locoregional control and even long-term survival in selected patients.Copyright © 2014, International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1089,"Patient radiation exposure during diagnostic and therapeutic interventional neuroradiology procedures PURPOSE: Increasing in number and complexity, interventional neuroradiology (INR) procedures are becoming an important source of radiation exposure for patients. In accordance with the ALARA principle, radiation exposure during INR procedures should be curtailed as much as possible while reaching successful treatment outcomes. Moreover, the extent of radiation exposure should be one outcome measure used to assess new technologies and procedural efficacy, and training programs should include techniques for exposure limitation. This study provides a methodology and preliminary data to assess radiation exposure during different INR procedure types., MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing endovascular procedures in two biplanar dedicated neuroangiography suites at a major academic medical center were monitored according to procedure type, pathological indication, fluoroscopy time and machine-generated patient dose estimates between April 2006 and July 2008., RESULTS: 1678 patients underwent cerebral arteriography during the study period. Women (62.1%) accounted for the majority of patients, but men (38.9%) were more likely to undergo an interventional procedure than women (32.8%). Diagnostic studies accounted for 64.9% of procedures. Variable exposures were found between diagnostic and interventional procedures. Exposure differed depending on indications for the procedure and procedure type., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure is an increasingly important consideration in the development of minimally invasive neurological procedures including cerebral angiography and INR. The type of procedure and lesion type allow the practitioner to estimate radiation exposure. Such information informs the clinical decision making process. Normative data should be collected and used for comparison purposes as one measure of technical and procedural success.",Excluded
912,"Radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma Background. To evaluate the treatment outcome of radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. Methods. Between 1996 and 2001, ten patients with isolated nodal recurrence after definitive chemoradiotherapy received radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The site of recurrence was the mediastinum in five patients, the celiac node in four patients, and the supraclavicular fossa in one patient. All sites of nodal recurrence were outside the previous irradiated area and without local recurrence or distant metastases. Radiotherapy was given with three-dimensional conformal technique, and an average total dose was 60 Gy. Eight patients received chemotherapy concurrently with radiotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and 5-FU. Results. The control rate of the irradiated region was eight of ten patients. The size of all controlled lesions was 3 cm or less in diameter. In five patients, distant metastases developed to other organs and caused death. Two patients survived without disease for 5 years and three patients survived 2 years or more. In four patients with an interval of 2 years or longer between the previous treatment and nodal recurrence, three patients survived without disease. Improvement of clinical symptoms such as dysphagia or hoarseness was obtained in five of six patients. Conclusions. Radiotherapy for isolated nodal recurrence of esophageal carcinoma after definitive chemoradiotherapy is suggested to be safe and effective. This treatment is promising as well as palliative. © Japan Esophageal Society and Springer-Verlag 2005.",Excluded
1875,"An exploratory analysis of public awareness and perception of ionizing radiation and guide to public health practice in Vermont Exposure to ionizing radiation has potential for acute and chronic health effects. Within the general public of the United States, there may be a discrepancy between perceived and actual health risks. In conjunction with the Vermont Department of Health, a survey designed to assess public perception and knowledge of ionizing radiation was administered at 6 Vermont locations (n = 169). Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were conducted. Eighty percent of respondents underestimated the contribution of medical imaging tests to total ionizing radiation exposure. Although only thirty-nine percent of participants were confdent in their healthcare professional's knowledge of ionizing radiation, most would preffer to receive information from their healthcare professional. Only one-third of individuals who received a medical imaging test in the past year were educated by their healthcare professional about the risks of these tests. Tose who tested their home for radon were twice as likely to choose radon as the greatest ionizing radiation risk to self. Although respondents had an above-average education level, there were many misperceptions of actual risks of exposure to ionizing radiation, particularly of medical imaging tests. Educating healthcare professionals would therefore have a profound and positive impact on public understanding of ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2015 Katherine M. Evans et al.",Excluded
390,"Diet and melanoma in a case-control study Background: Malignant melanoma has been one of the most rapidly increasing cancers within the United States with few modifiable risk factors. This study investigates risk related to dietary factors, which are potentially modifiable. Method(s): Newly diagnosed patients with melanoma (n = 502) were recruited from pigment lesion clinics and controls (n = 565) were recruited from outpatient clinics. To investigate the relationship between melanoma and dietary factors in this case-control study, study subjects were requested to complete a food frequency questionnaire, which assessed diet over the previous year. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) for melanoma were computed for nutrient and alcohol intake. Result(s): Persons in high versus low quintiles of energy-adjusted vitamin D, alphacarotene, beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein, and lycopene had significantly reduced risk for melanoma (ORs <= 0.67), which remained after adjustment for presence of dysplastic nevi, education, and skin response to repeated sun exposure. Addition of micronutrients from supplements did not add an additional reduction in risk. High alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk for melanoma, which remained after adjustment for confounders [OR (95% confidence interval) in highest versus lowest quintiles, 1.65 (1.09-2.49)]. Conclusion(s): Diets consisting of foods rich in vitamin D and carotenoids and low in alcohol may be associated with a reduction in risk for melanoma.

1335,"Cancer incidence and mortality in populations living near uranium milling and mining operations in grants, New Mexico, 1950-2004 In a previous cohort study of workers engaged in uranium milling and mining activities near Grants, Cibola County, New Mexico, we found lung cancer mortality to be significantly increased among underground miners. Uranium mining took place from early in the 1950s to 1990, and the Grants Uranium Mill operated from 1958-1990. The present study evaluates cancer mortality during 1950-2004 and cancer incidence during 1982-2004 among county residents. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed, with observed numbers of cancer deaths and cases compared to expected values based on New Mexico cancer rates. The total numbers of cancer deaths and incident cancers were close to that expected (SMR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; SIR 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02). Lung cancer mortality and incidence were significantly increased among men (SMR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.21; SIR 1.40, 95% CI 1.18-1.64) but not women (SMR 0.97, 95% CI 0.85-1.10; SIR 1.01, 95% CI 0.78-1.29). Similarly, among the population of the three census tracts near the Grants Uranium Mill, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated among men (SMR 1.57; 95% CI 1.21-1.99) but not women (SMR 1.12; 95% CI 0.75-1.61). Except for an elevation in mortality for stomach cancer among women (SMR 1.30; 95% CI 1.03-1.63), which declined over the 55-year observation period, no significant increases in SMRs or SIRs for 22 other cancers were found. Although etiological inferences cannot be drawn from these ecological data, the excesses of lung cancer among men seem likely to be due to previously reported risks among underground miners from exposure to radon gas and its decay products. Smoking, socioeconomic factors or ethnicity may also have contributed to the lung cancer excesses observed in our study. The stomach cancer increase was highest before the uranium mill began operation and then decreased to normal levels. With the exception of male lung cancer, this study provides no clear or consistent evidence that the operation of uranium mills and mines adversely affected cancer incidence or mortality of county residents.",Excluded
2193,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

1878,"Comparison of normal tissue pharmacokinetics with 111In/90Y monoclonal antibody m170 for breast and prostate cancer Purpose: Radioactivity deposition in normal tissues limits the dose deliverable by radiopharmaceuticals (RP) in radioimmunotherapy (RIT). This study investigated the absorbed radiation dose in normal tissues for prostate cancer patients in comparison to breast cancer patients for 2 RPs using the monoclonal antibody (MAb) m170. Methods and Materials: 111In-DOTA-glycylglycylglycyl-l-p-isothiocyanatophenylalanine amide (GGGF)-m170 and 111In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N,N'-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) 2-iminothiolane (2IT)-m170, representing the same MAb and chelate with and without a cleavable linkage, were studied in 13 breast cancer and 26 prostate cancer patients. Dosimetry for 90Y was calculated using 111In MAb pharmacokinetics from the initial imaging study for each patient, using reference man- and patient-specific masses. Result(s): The reference man-specific radiation doses (cGy/MBq) were not significantly different for the breast and the prostate cancer patients for both RPs in all but one tissue-RP combination (liver, DOTA-2IT). The patient-specific doses had differences between the groups most of which can be related to weight differences. Conclusion(s): Similar normal tissue doses were calculated for two groups of patients having different cancers and genders. This similarity combined with continued careful analysis of the imaging data might allow the use of higher starting doses in early phase RIT studies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, the sequencing of the two modalities, as well as fractionation of RT, has been controversial. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Study 92-04 was a randomized Phase II study designed to evaluate further the toxicity and efficacy of 2 different strategies of chemoradiation evaluated in 2 prior RTOG Phase II studies., METHODS: Patients with Stage II or III medically inoperable or unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, good performance status, and minimal weight loss were enrolled into a prospective randomized Phase II RTOG study. Arm 1 consisted of induction ChT (vinblastine 5 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus weekly for the first 5 weeks, and cisplatin, 100 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 29) followed by concurrent ChT/RT (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 50, 71, and 92) during thoracic radiotherapy (63 Gy in 34 fractions during 7 weeks starting on Day 50). Arm 2 was concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT starting on Day 1 with a total dose of 69.6 Gy in 58 fractions during 6 weeks, 1.2 Gy/fraction b.i.d. ChT consisted of cisplatin, 50 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8, and oral VP-16, 50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days only on the days of thoracic radiotherapy repeated on Day 29., RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were entered between 1992 and 1994, and 163 patients were eligible for analysis. Eighty-one patients were treated in Arm 1 and 82 patients in Arm 2. Pretreatment characteristics, including age, gender, Karnofsky performance status, histologic features, and stage, were similar. The incidence of acute esophagitis was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 2 than among those treated in Arm 1 (p <0.0001). The incidence of acute hematologic toxicity was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 1 (p = 0.01 for anemia and p = 0.03 for other hematologic toxicities) than among those treated in Arm 2. Analysis of late toxicity showed that chronic esophageal toxicity was significantly more frequent in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 (p = 0.003). The time to in-field progression was significantly different (p = 0.009), favoring Arm 2 compared with Arm 1 (26% vs. 45% with failure in 2 years and 30% vs. 49% with failure in 4 years, respectively). The median 2-year and overall 5-year survival rates were similar between the two arms., CONCLUSION: Concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT resulted in a significant prolongation of the time to in-field progression, but with higher acute and chronic esophagitis. No other significant differences were observed between the two groups. Investigation with a chemoradio-protector is under way.",Excluded
3006,"Myocardial perfusion imaging with a cadmium zinc telluride-based gamma camera versus invasive fractional flow reserve Purpose: Recently introduced ultrafast cardiac SPECT cameras with cadmium zinc telluride-based (CZT) detectors may provide superior image quality allowing faster acquisition with reduced radiation doses. Although the level of concordance between conventional SPECT and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement has been studied, that between FFR and CZT-based SPECT is not yet known. Therefore, we aimed to assess the level of concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR in a large patient group with stable coronary artery disease. Method(s): Both invasive FFR and myocardial perfusion imaging with a CZT-based SPECT camera, using Tc-tetrofosmin as tracer, were performed in 100 patients with stable angina and intermediate grade stenosis on invasive coronary angiography. A cut-off value of <0.75 was used to define abnormal FFR. Result(s): The mean age of the patients was 64+/-11 years, and 64 % were men. SPECT demonstrated ischaemia in 31 % of the patients, and 20 % had FFR <0.75. The concordance between CZT SPECT and FFR was 73 % on a per-patient basis and 79 % on a per-vessel basis. Discordant findings were more often seen in older patients and were mainly (19 %) the result of ischaemic SPECT findings in patients with FFR >=0.75, whereas only 8 % had an abnormal FFR without ischaemia as demonstrated by CZT SPECT. Conclusion(s): Only 20 - 30 % of patients with intermediate coronary stenoses had significant ischaemia as assessed by CZT SPECT or invasive FFR. CZT SPECT showed a modest degree of concordance with FFR, which is comparable with previous results with conventional SPECT. Further investigations are particularly necessary in patients with normal SPECT and abnormal FFR, especially to determine whether these patients should undergo revascularization. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1014,"Rationale and design of the NO-PARTY trial: Near-zero fluoroscopic exposure during catheter ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias in young patients Introduction Radiofrequency catheter ablation is the mainstay of therapy for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Conventional radiofrequency catheter ablation requires the use of fluoroscopy, thus exposing patients to ionising radiation. The feasibility and safety of non-fluoroscopic radiofrequency catheter ablation has been recently reported in a wide range of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias using the EnSite NavXTM mapping system. The NO-PARTY is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial designed to test the hypothesis that catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system results in a clinically significant reduction in exposure to ionising radiation compared with conventional catheter ablation. Methods The study will randomise 210 patients undergoing catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias to either a conventional ablation technique or one guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system. The primary end-point is the reduction of the radiation dose to the patient. Secondary end-points include procedural success, reduction of the radiation dose to the operator, and a cost-effectiveness analysis. In a subgroup of patients, we will also evaluate the radiobiological effectiveness of dose reduction by assessing acute chromosomal DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Conclusions NO-PARTY will determine whether radiofrequency catheter ablation of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias guided by the EnSite NavXTM mapping system is a suitable and cost-effective approach to achieve a clinically significant reduction in ionising radiation exposure for both patient and operator. © Copyright 2012 Cambridge University Press.",Excluded
1509,"Clinical experience in 89 consecutive cases of chronic radiation enterocolitis BACKGROUND: Pelvic irradiation has been a popular therapy modality for cervical cancer for many years, and its usage in rectal cancer and prostate cancer cases is on the rise. However, it is associated with significant side effects. In this study, we compared the different characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients who were treated for radiation enterocolitis, the treatment results, posttreatment quality of life (QOL), nutrition status, and predisposing factors for surgery., METHODS: From 1985 to 2009, the records of a total of 89 patients with chronic radiation enterocolitis in our hospital were retrospectively reviewed for demographic data, operative data and long-term treatment results. Posttreatment QOL and nutrition status were also recorded. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predicting factors associated with surgical intervention. Characteristics of surgical and nonsurgical patients were compared., RESULTS: Radiotherapy before 1995, concomitant radiation uropathy and smoking were independent predictive factors for surgery. Surgical and nonsurgical cases had similar Kaplan-Meier curves. Although the recurrence rate of radiation enterocolitis was much higher for the surgical group (p = 0.031), both groups had similar QOL score (median: 8 vs.7; p = 0.709), serum albumin level (3.29 g/dL vs. 3.16 g/dL; p = 0.095), and body mass index (20.19 vs. 19.86; p = 0.603)., CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that as compared with recently developed innovative techniques, early primitive radiotherapy techniques were associated with more severe radiotherapy complications that required surgery. Smoking may enhance patients' vulnerability to severe radiation injury. Surgery for radiation-induced intestinal obstruction, intestinal fistula and perforation is warranted because QOL, serum albumin level and body mass index were similar between the surgical and nonsurgical groups.

The purpose of our study was to assess variations in CT protocols and radiation doses for evaluation of hematuria and urinary stones in 20 countries., METHOD: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) surveyed practices in 51 hospitals from 20 countries in the European region according to the IAEA Technical cooperation classification and obtained following information for three CT protocols (urography, urinary stones, and routine abdomen-pelvis CT) for 1276 patients: patient information (weight, clinical indication), scanner information (scan vendor, scanner name, number of detector rows), scan parameters (such as number of phases, scan start and end locations, mA, kV), and radiation dose descriptors (CTDIvol, DLP). Two radiologists assessed the appropriateness of clinical indications and number of scan phases using the ESR Referral Guidelines and ACR Appropriateness Criteria. Descriptive statistics and Student's t tests were performed., RESULTS: Most institutions use 3-6 phase CT urography protocols (80 %, median DLP 1793-3618mGy.cm) which were associated with 2.4-4.9-fold higher dose compared to 2-phase protocol (20 %, 740mGy.cm) (p<0.0001). Likewise, 52 % patients underwent 3-5 phase routine abdomen- pelvis CT (1574-2945mGy.cm) as opposed to 37 % scanned with a single-phase routine CT (676mGy.cm). The median DLP for urinary stones CT (516mGy.cm) were significantly lower than the median DLP for the other two CT protocols (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Few institutions (4/13) use low dose CT for urinary stones. There are substantial variations in CT urography and routine abdomen-pelvis CT protocols result in massive radiation doses (up to 2945-3618mGy.cm). Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

2154,"Multiple cervical lymph node involvement and extra-capsular extension predict for contralateral nodal recurrence after ipsilateral radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil Background: Ipsilateral radiotherapy is an established technique for treating well-lateralised tonsillar tumours. Concerns exist regarding the risk of contralateral nodal failure, particularly in patients with ipsilateral nodal involvement at presentation. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy aiming to identify factors that predispose to a higher risk of contralateral nodal recurrence. Method(s): Retrospective case note review of all patients with tonsillar cancer who were treated using ipsilateral radiotherapy between September 1995 and September 2011 was performed. Demographics, T and N stage, involvement of soft palate and/or tongue base, presence of extra-capsular spread (ECS) and treatment details were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment outcomes were generated. Result(s): A total of 136 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Twelve (9%) patients had loco-regional recurrence. Eight patients (6%) had contralateral recurrence. N2b disease, ECS and number of pack-years of smoking were associated with contralateral nodal recurrence. Five-year overall survival was 89%, loco-regional disease-free survival 90%, disease-free survival 86% and distal recurrence-free survival 96%.

1360,"Glaucoma incidence risk in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation Glaucoma is a major cause of visual impairment, and secondary glaucoma manifested as neovascular glaucoma has long been known to occur following high-dose fractionated radiation therapy.

Therefore, the effect of lower dose and lower dose rate remains unclear. Here we report that in Russian Mayak Production Association workers occupationally exposed to chronic radiation for prolonged periods, incidence of total primary glaucoma and primary open-angle glaucoma is significantly associated with various non-radiation factors (sex, attained age, and cataract diagnosed prior to glaucoma), but neither with cumulative dose from external gamma-rays nor with cumulative neutron dose nor with the unweighted sum of cumulative gamma and neutron doses.

Material and methods gammaH2AX foci were quantified in tumor specimens of 3 hHNSCC tumor models with known differences in radiosensitivity after reoxygenation in culture medium (10 h, 24 h), single dose exposure (0 Gy, 4 Gy), and fixation 24 h post-irradiation. Multiple, equally treated samples of the same tumor were analyzed for foci, normalized and fitted in a linear mixed-effects model. Results The ex vivo reoxygenation time had no significant effect on gammaH2AX foci counts. A significant intra model heterogeneity could be shown for FaDu (p = 0.033) but not for SKX (p = 0.167) and UT-SCC-5 (p = 0.082) tumors, respectively. All tumor models showed a significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity between specimens of the same tumor (p < 0.01) or among microscopic fields of a particular tumor specimen (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Similar results for ex vivo gammaH2AX foci between 10 h and 24 h reoxygenation time support the applicability of the assay in a clinical setting.

Data on the influence of rhenium-188 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (188Re-HEDP), rhenium-186 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (186Re-HEDP), and strontium-89 (89Sr) on pain symptoms, quality of life, and bone-marrow function were obtained in 64 patients with breast and prostate cancer. Thirty-one patients were treated with 188Re-HEDP (3194 +/- 387 MBq), 15 patients with 186Re-HEDP (1358 +/- 158 MBq), and 18 patients with 89Sr (152 +/- 19 MBq). The 188Re-HEDP group included six breast cancer patients and 25 prostate cancer patients; the 186Re-HEDP group included three breast cancer patients and 12 prostate cancer patients; and the 89Sr group included three breast cancer patients and 15 prostate cancer patients. All subjects participated in an interview using a standardized sets of questions before and after the 12-week term of therapy. Blood counts were taken weekly for six weeks and after 12 weeks. Results showed that 77 percent of patients reported pain relief after treatment with 188Re-HEDP, 67 percent after treatment with 186Re-HEDP, and 72 percent after treatment with 89Sr. Sixteen percent of patients treated with 188Re-HEDP, 13 percent treated with 186Re-HEDP, and 17 percent treated with 89Sr were able to discontinue their analgesics and were pain-free. Patients described an improvement on Karnofsky performance status (KPS) from 73 +/- 7 percent to 85 +/- 8 percent 12 weeks after 188Re-HEDP (p < 0. 05), from 72 +/- 13 percent to 79 +/- 12 percent after 186Re-HEDP (p = 0.251), and from 62 +/- 14 percent to 69 +/- 16 percent after 89Sr (p = 0.415). Only three patients undergoing 188Re-HEDP therapy, one undergoing 186Re-HEDP therapy, and three undergoing 89Sr therapy had thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100 x 10(3)/microl) following treatment. The maximum nadir of platelet and leukocyte counts was observed between the second and fifth week after treatment for all radionuclides and was reversible within 12 weeks. The nadir was earlier for 188Re-HEDP with a shorter physical half-life compared with 89Sr. There were no significant differences in bone marrow toxicity (p = 0.123-0.421). Results of this study indicate that all evaluated radiopharmaceuticals were effective in pain palliation without induction of severe side effects. The increase in KPS after 188Re-HEDP was the only statistically significant finding (p = 0.001).",Excluded
2823,"How far can the radiation dose be lowered in head CT with iterative reconstruction? Analysis of imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy Objective: To evaluate the imaging quality of head CT at lowered radiation dose by combining filtered back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms. Method(s): Experimental group A (n = 66) underwent CT with 43 % tube current reduction, and group B (n = 58) received an equivalent reduced dose by lowering the tube voltage. An age- and sex-matched control group (n = 72) receiving the conventional radiation dose was retrospectively collected. Imaging for the control group was reconstructed by FBP only, while images for groups A and B were reconstructed by FBP and IR. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs), sharpness, number of infarcts and severity of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) were compared to assess imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): There were no significant differences in SNRs and CNRs between group A and the control group. There were significantly decreased SNRs and increased CNRs in group B. Image sharpness decreased in both groups. Correlations between detected infarcts and severity of SAE across FBP and IR were high (r = 0.73-0.93). Head diameter was the only significant factor inversely correlated with infratentorial imaging quality. Conclusion(s): Head CT with 43 % reduced tube current reconstructed by IR provides diagnostic imaging quality for outpatient management. Key Points: * Cranial CT using iterative reconstruction provides diagnostic images with 43 % mAs reduction. * Blurring of infratentorial images becomes evident using low-radiation head CT. * Head diameter was inversely correlated with imaging quality in the infratentorium. * Lowering tube kilovoltage requires a higher radiation dose to maintain image quality. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded

The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded
1023,"Value of dual-phase 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy with neck and thoracic SPECT/CT in secondary hyperparathyroidism OBJECTIVE. Surgical intervention in the form of parathyroidectomy is generally considered only for severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT). However, correct location of the parathyroid glands before parathyroidectomy is a challenge. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT in the detection of parathyroid tissue to guide operative treatment of patients with sHPT. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eighty patients with sHPT who were undergoing hemodialysis were evaluated preoperatively with dual-phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT parathyroid scintigraphy to locate parathyroid tissue before parathyroidectomy. The scintigraphic results were classified as positive or negative. The accuracy of 99mTc sestamibi early and delayed phase SPECT/CT scintigraphy was determined. RESULTS. Early phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT depicted 3.57 parathyroid glands (PTGs) and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT depicted 3.55 PTGs per study. The specificity of both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT in detecting PTGs was 100%. The 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT images of 7 of 80 patients showed positive findings in the delayed phase and negative findings in the early phase. The 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT images of 6 of 80 patients showed positive findings in the early phase and negative findings in the delayed phase. CONCLUSION. The results of our study indicate that both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT should be performed in the preoperative evaluation of hemodialysis patients with sHPT due to chronic kidney disease. Performance of both early and delayed phase 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT did not increase the radiation dose compared with the use of only the early or the delayed phase. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1342,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and risk of glioma BACKGROUND: About 9% of human cancers are brain tumors, of which 90% are gliomas. gamma-Radiation has been identified as a risk factor for brain tumors. In a previous pilot study, we found that lymphocytes from patients with glioma were more sensitive to gamma-radiation than were lymphocytes from matched control subjects. In this larger case-control study, we compared the gamma-radiation sensitivity of lymphocytes from glioma patients with those from control subjects and investigated the association between mutagen sensitivity and the risk for developing glioma., METHODS: We used a mutagen sensitivity assay (an indirect measure of DNA repair activity) to assess chromosomal damage. We gamma-irradiated (1.5 Gy) short-term lymphocyte cultures from 219 case patients with glioma and from 238 healthy control subjects frequency matched by age and sex. After irradiation, cells were cultured for 4 hours, and then Colcemid was added for 1 hour to arrest cells in mitosis. Fifty metaphases were randomly selected for each sample and scored for chromatid breaks. All statistical tests were two-sided., RESULTS: We observed a statistically significantly higher frequency of chromatid breaks per cell from case patients with glioma (mean = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50 to 0.59) than from control subjects (mean = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.41 to 0.48) (P<.001). Using 0.40 (the median number of chromatid breaks per cell in control subjects) as the cut point for defining mutagen sensitivity and adjusting for age, sex, and smoking status, we found that mutagen sensitivity was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk for glioma (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% CI = 1.43 to 3.06). When the data were divided into tertiles, the relative risk for glioma increased from the lowest tertile to the highest tertile (trend test, P<.001)., CONCLUSION: gamma-Radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity of lymphocytes may be associated with an increased risk for glioma, a result that supports our earlier preliminary findings.",Included
1884,"Radiation dose reduction for CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to retrospectively determine the image quality and degree of radiation dose reduction that is clinically acceptable for CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 15 patients (17 procedures; mean age, 67 years; range, 38-85 years) undergoing clinically indicated CT-guided renal tumor cryoablation procedures were included in this retrospective study. A previously validated noise-insertion tool was used to simulate reduced-dose scans at 75%, 50%, 25%, and 10% of the original dose at four representative phases of the cryoablation procedure. Images obtained at different dose levels were randomized and reviewed by three radiologists blinded to the level of dose reduction, who scored them independently with a 5-point scale (1-5, with 5 the best). Images with a mean score of 3 or higher were considered diagnostically acceptable. The minimal acceptable dose was that at which 90% of images were considered diagnostically acceptable. Interrater agreement was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic., RESULTS: The weighted kappa value was 0.68, indicating substantial agreement among the reviewers. The averaged percentage of diagnostically acceptable images for the four series was 100% for a full dose, 98-100% for the 75% dose level, 94-98% for the 50% dose level, and less than 90% for images obtained at the 25% and 10% dose levels, which was considered unacceptable., CONCLUSION: On the basis of results from 15 patients (17 procedures), images obtained from CT acquisitions at 50% (volume CT dose index, 12.2 mGy) of the original dose level (volume CT dose index, 24.4 mGy) were acceptable for the purpose of CT monitoring of renal cryoablation procedures.",Excluded

1554,"Diagnostic performance of CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic core needle biopsy using low tube voltage (100 kVp): comparison with conventional tube voltage (120 kVp) Background: Computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous transthoracic core needle biopsy (PTNB) is typically performed at 120 kVp tube voltage. However, there is no study that has demonstrated diagnostic performance including ground-glass nodules and radiation dose reduction at lower tube voltage in large population. Purpose(s): To retrospectively compare the diagnostic performance and radiation dose between 100 kVp and 120 kVp during CT-guided PTNB. Material(s) and Method(s): This study included 393 PTNBs performed in 385 patients (Group I; 120 kVp) from March 2011 to September 2011 and 1368 PTNBs performed in 1318 patients (Group II; 100 kVp) from October 2011 to December 2013. The patients underwent CT-guided PTNB with the coaxial technique. Diagnostic performance, complication rate, and radiation dose were compared between two groups. Result(s): Technical success was achieved in 391 of 393 PTNBs (99.5%) in Group I and in 1344 of 1368 PTNBs (98.2%) in Group II (P = 0.09). The diagnostic accuracies for pulmonary lesions were not significantly different between two groups (97.1% [362/373] versus 96.2% [1202/1249], P = 0.458). Complication rate showed no significant differences between two groups in terms of pneumothorax (19.7% [77/391] versus 19.4% [261/1344], P = 0.904) and hemoptysis (2.3% [9/391] versus 3.2% [43/1344], P = 0.360). Among patients who developed pneumothorax, three patients (3.9%, 3/77) in Group I and eight patients (3.1%, 8/261) in Group II required treatment with drainage catheter. Nobody needed further treatment for hemoptysis in the two groups. The mean radiation dose was 1.5 +/- 1.9 mSv in Group I and 0.7 +/- 0.3 mSv in Group II (P < 0.001).

The control animals were sham radiated but were otherwise treated identically as those of the experimental groups. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture before radiation and 30 min after each exposure of 150 rads. The red cells were re-suspended in their own plasma and HMP pathway activity was measured in the suspension. The pathway activity showed a consistent but minor reduction in the experimental group, which became statistically significant after the total dose of 750 rads (P less than 0.020). In a separate study the changes induced by ionizing radiation in the erythrocyte enzyme NADH-methemoglobin reductase were measured using the same experimental protocol.

Data on disease control and toxicity were collected as well as patient and treatment characteristics. Acute (<6 mo) and late (>=6 mo) severe toxicity (grade >=3) were graded. Four patients were excluded due to the presence of metastatic disease or stage TX. Late toxicity data were available for 120 patients., RESULTS: Median cumulative IMRT dose was 51.25 Gy (median, 28 fractions). All but 2 patients received chemotherapy. With median follow-up of 26.8 months, local control at 3 years was 87%, worse for patients with T3-T4 than T1-T2 disease on univariate analysis (79% vs. 90%; P=0.04). Regional control, distant control, and overall survival were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively, at 3 years. Nodal status was associated with regional control, distant control, and overall survival (P<0.01 for each). Most common severe acute toxicity was hematologic (41%), skin (20%), and gastrointestinal tract (11%). Two grade 5 toxicities occurred (hematologic and gastrointestinal tract). Severe late toxicity affected skin (1%) and gastrointestinal tract (3%)., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT with chemotherapy resulted in excellent local control. Although T stage predicted worse local control, most T3-T4 disease was controlled with IMRT. Nodal status predicted regional and distant control and overall survival. Severe toxicity was acceptable.",Excluded
2151,"Trimming the fat in acute ischemic stroke: an assessment of 24-h CT scans in tPA patients BACKGROUND: International management of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator frequently includes 24-h head imaging. These recommendations stem from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) clinical trial protocol regarding the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage post-tissue plasminogen activator administration. Follow-up computed tomography scans on select patients, however, may not effect clinical management, resulting in unnecessary radiation exposure and healthcare costs., AIMS: Our study questions the utility of routine 24-h computed tomography imaging and looks at the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale as a possible clinical screen for selecting candidates for 24-h imaging. Such a tool would result in decreased radiation exposure to the patient and decreased cost to the hospital., METHODS: Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke given intravenous tissue plasminogen activator between June 2008 and December 2011 were retrospectively identified and dichotomized based on change in 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale from baseline. Initial analysis compared patients with National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening to those without worsening. Subsequent analysis was limited to patients with a baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10. Baseline demographics and medical history, baseline and 24-h computed tomography findings, medical and/or surgical orders within six-hours of imaging, and antithrombotic administration within 24-48-h postintravenous tissue plasminogen activator were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: Two-hundred patients met inclusion criteria: No 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening (n = 167) vs. 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening (n = 33). No baseline demographic or admission data differed significantly between the two groups. Patients without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening had significantly lower incidence of hemorrhagic infarction (10.8% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.0014) on follow-up imaging. Less than 2% of all patients without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening had a parenchymal hematoma. No patient with baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10 and without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening had parenchymal hematoma. Patients with 24-h worsening were significantly less likely to receive timely antithrombotic therapy (60.6% vs. 77.8%, odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.20-0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that routine 24-h computed tomography scan in patients without 24-h National Institute of Health Stroke Scale worsening (especially those with baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10) is less likely to yield information that results in a deviation from standard acute stroke care. No patient without worsening and baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale <=10 had parenchymal hematoma on 24-h computed tomography. Application of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale to distinguish patients who should have 24-h follow-up imaging from those who will not benefit is a potential avenue for improving utilization of resources and warrants further study.

Our purpose was to determine whether the dose to the brachial plexus (BP) can be constrained, without compromising regional control., METHODS: The radiation plans of 324 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were reviewed. We identified 42 patients (13%) with gross nodal disease <1 cm from the BP. Normal tissue constraints included a maximum dose of 66 Gy and a D05 of 60 Gy for the BP. These criteria took precedence over planning target volume (PTV) coverage of nodal disease near the BP., RESULTS: There was only one regional failure in the vicinity of the BP, salvaged with neck dissection (ND) and regional re-irradiation. There have been no reported episodes of brachial plexopathy to date., CONCLUSIONS: In combined-modality therapy, including ND as salvage, regional control did not appear to be compromised by constraining the dose to the BP. This approach may improve the therapeutic ratio by reducing the long-term risk of brachial plexopathy.",Excluded
1815,"Intraoperative radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for stage II/III rectal carcinoma In recent years, many efforts have focused on combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy as adjuvants to curative surgery in patients with stage II and III (UICC) rectal carcinomas. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) makes it possible to increase the total irradiation dose in a locally restricted area while sparing normal mobile organs, but it is limited by increased late toxicity. A prospective phase I/II study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of moderate-dose intraoperative and external beam radiotherapy (IO-EBRT), in some cases with concomitant chemotherapy. Sixty-three patients with a stage II or III rectal carcinoma were eligible for analysis (median follow-up 30.6 months). Fifty-four patients had undergone a complete resection (RO). Mean IORT dose was 11.3 Gy and mean EBRT dose 41.4 Gy. In 45 patients (71.4%) concomitant chemotherapy was delivered (5-FU, leucovorin). Two patients suffered local failure. However, overall local tumor control was markedly improved compared to historical controls (96.8% vs 66.2%). Patients treated with IO-EBRT showed a reduced incidence of distant metastases after concomitant chemotherapy (17.6% vs 38.8%). A 4-year actuarial relapse-free survival of 82% was obtained after IO-EBRT plus chemotherapy, and 59% after IO-EBRT alone. The postoperative course was unremarkable in 47.6% of patients.

3291,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1587,"Perception of Egocentric Distance during Gravitational Changes in Parabolic Flight We explored the effect of gravity on the perceived representation of the absolute distance of objects to the observers within the range from 1.5-6 m. Experiments were performed on board the CNES Airbus Zero-G during parabolic flights eliciting repeated exposures to short periods of microgravity (0 g), hypergravity (1.8 g), and normal gravity (1 g). Two methods for obtaining estimates of perceived egocentric distance were used: verbal reports and visually directed motion toward a memorized visual target. For the latter method, because normal walking is not possible in 0 g, blindfolded subjects translated toward the visual target by pulling on a rope with their arms. The results showed that distance estimates using both verbal reports and blind pulling were significantly different between normal gravity, microgravity, and hypergravity. Compared to the 1 g measurements, the estimates of perceived distance using blind pulling were shorter for all distances in 1.8 g, whereas in 0 g they were longer for distances up to 4 m and shorter for distances beyond. These findings suggest that gravity plays a role in both the sensorimotor system and the perceptual/cognitive system for estimating egocentric distance.",Excluded

Rectal bleeding caused by radiation proctitis is difficult to manage. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is an electrocoagulation technique that appears to be an effective and low-cost alternative to the use of lasers in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of APC, as well as patients' tolerance of the procedure, in the treatment of bleeding radiation-induced proctitis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 16 patients with chronic radiation proctitis were analyzed retrospectively. Their average age was 73.5 (range 62-80). Fifteen patients had prostate cancer, and one had uterine cancer. The average time to onset of symptoms after radiotherapy was 15 months (range 6-36 months). All patients had intermittent or daily rectal bleeding, and three patients needed blood transfusions. The severity of bleeding was graded from 0 to 4. APC treatment was administered every month; the argon gas flow was set at 0.6 l/min with an electrical power setting of 40 W., RESULTS: All patients were improved with APC treatment. A mean of 3.7 sessions was necessary to relieve symptoms. APC therapy resulted in a reduction in the mean severity score from 2.4 to 0.6. Seven patients had no recurrent rectal bleeding, and the bleeding was significantly reduced to occasional and negligible spotting (less than one bleeding episode per week) in nine patients. None of the patients required transfusions after treatment. During the follow-up period (average 10.7 months, range 8-28 months), one patient had a recurrence of rectal bleeding that required two repeat sessions. The tolerance was good, with no long-term treatment-related complications., CONCLUSIONS: APC is an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment for rectal bleeding caused by chronic radiation proctitis. It should be considered as a first-line therapy for radiation proctitis.",Excluded

Cytogenetic tests were conducted on 2396 healthy Hungarian individuals and cancer incidence was followed up from 1989 to 2018. Venous blood samples were obtained from the subjects and metaphases from lymphocyte cultures were prepared. We compared the CA frequencies of the various smoking (1-5; 6-10; 11-19; or 20-40 cigarettes/day) and exposure (irradiation; chemical industry; chemical research laboratory) groups. Chromatid break (p = 0.0002), total aberration (p = 0.002), and aberrant cell (p = 0.001) frequencies were higher in smokers than in non-smokers. For very heavy smokers, total CAs were significantly higher than for non-smokers (<0.001) or less intensive smokers (p = 0.003-0.0006). Intensity of smoking was a predictor of chromosomal aberrations, while duration was not. During follow-up, 177 (7.3 %) cancer cases were found. A Cox-regression model showed that subjects with cell values >=2 CAs developed cancer more frequently (hazard ratio = 1.39; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.90). The relative risks of cancer were 1.06 (95 % CI 0.53-2.06) for light smokers and 1.74 (95 % CI 1.08-2.77) for very heavy smokers. The distributions of cancer sites showed differences between smoker and non-smoker groups: in male smokers, lung cancer, in non-smokers, prostate, and in females (both groups) breast cancer were most common. Cancer incidence correlated with chromosome aberrations; smoking was not a confounder in this relationship.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3267,"[Radiotherapy of stomach cancer under conditions of severe exogenous hypoxia (8% O2)] Irradiation of 116 stomach cancer patients was performed under the conditions of hypoxia caused by the inhalation of a gaseous mixture containing (8 +/- 0.5%) O2; irradiation of 108 patients was performed in the air. The method of hypoxic radiotherapy of stomach cancer is described. The authors present some data on radiation reactions, tumor regression, the condition of tumorous and normal tissue after radiotherapy under the conditions of hypoxia which permitted an increase in a tumor radiation dose and a decrease in the number and gravity of radiation reactions. The above method of large field preoperative irradiation made it possible to improve short-term results of combined therapy of stomach cancer patients.",Excluded
2991,"Dynamic multidetector CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR for right adrenal vein imaging: comparison with catheter venography in adrenal venous sampling OBJECTIVES: To evaluate visualization of the right adrenal vein (RAV) with multidetector CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging in patients with primary aldosteronism., METHODS: A total of 125 patients (67 men) scheduled for adrenal venous sampling (AVS) were included. Dynamic 64-detector-row CT and balanced steady-state free precession-based non-contrast-enhanced 3-T MR imaging were performed. RAV visualization based on a four-point score was documented. Both anatomical location and variation on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated, and the findings were compared with catheter venography as the gold standard., RESULTS: The RAV was visualized in 93.2% by CT and 84.8% by MR imaging (p = 0.02). Positive predictive values of RAV visualization were 100% for CT and 95.2% for MR imaging. Imaging score was significantly higher in CT than MR imaging (p < 0.01). The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 16% of patients. The RAV orifice level on cross-sectional imaging was concordant with catheter venography within the range of 1/3 vertebral height in >70% of subjects. Success rate of AVS was 99.2%., CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT is a reliable way to map the RAV prior to AVS. Non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging is an alternative when there is a risk of complication from contrast media or radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: Dynamic CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging detect the right adrenal vein (RAV). Dynamic CT can visualize the RAV more than non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Mapping the RAV helps to achieve successful adrenal venous sampling. Sixteen per cent of RAVs share the common trunk with accessory hepatic veins.",Excluded
1155,"Evidence that ferritin is UV inducible in human skin: part of a putative defense mechanism As ferritin has been identified as an important factor in antioxidant defense in cultured human skin cells we evaluated the presence of ferritin in human skin in vivo and the modifications following irradiation with UVA I, UVA I + II, and solar simulating light by immunohistochemical analysis. We report that the putative protective protein ferritin is regularly present in the basal layer of unirradiated epidermis in vivo and that the induction of ferritin was dependent on wavelength and cell type. Following UVA I radiation, ferritin increased both in epidermal and in dermal tissue. The same response occurred, although to a lesser extent, with UVA I + II but did not occur following solar simulating radiation. Quantitative analysis for ferritin in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts from seven individuals following each UV spectra were also assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The induction of ferritin by UV was highly dependent on the waveband and cell type. UVA I and UVA I + II radiations induced ferritin expression in dermal fibroblasts up to 260% and 200% over basal levels, respectively. Solar simulating radiation produced only a small induction of approximately 130% over basal ferritin levels in dermal fibroblasts. Ferritin increased in cultured fibroblasts as early as 3 h post-UVA with a peak at 6 h that remained until 48 h; there was no observable qualitative or quantitative increase seen in the undifferentiated cultured epidermal keratinocytes. Our findings indicate that the putative defense system of ferritin exists in human skin in vivo and its induction is dependent on UV spectra and cell type. The increased concentrations of this antioxidant in human skin following acute UV radiation could afford increased protection against subsequent oxidative stress.",Excluded
1824,"LOW BMI PATIENT DOSE IN DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY In this study, the radiation dose received by 364 low body mass index (BMI) adult patients undergoing chest, abdomen, lumbar spine, kidneys and urinary bladder (KUB) and pelvis X-ray examinations in an X-ray room with a digital radiography system was evaluated. The patients' kerma area product (KAP) values were recorded, and the entrance surface air kerma (ESAK) was calculated based on the X-ray tube output, exposure parameters and technical data. The 75th percentiles of the distribution of ESAK and KAP values were also estimated. The dose values were compared with the corresponding values for normal patients obtained from a previous survey in our hospital, as well as with the national and UK diagnostic reference levels (DRLs). The correlation of dose values with patient size metrics (mass, height, BMI) was also investigated. A statistically significant difference was found in KAP and the ESAK values between low BMI and normal patients (Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.05), for all examinations studied. The percentage difference for chest PA, chest LAT, abdomen PA, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT, pelvis AP and KUB AP examinations was 40, 36, 48, 68, 57, 46 and 67% for median KAP and 26, 43, 52, 48, 19, 44 and 51% for median ESAK, respectively. The corresponding 75th percentiles for low BMI patients were 0.065, 0.349, 0.683, 1.54, 3.92, 1.11, 0.67 mGy and 0.042, 0.218, 0.450, 0.280, 0.598, 0.597, 0.267 Gycm2 in terms of ESAK and KAP values, respectively. They were 74-90% lower compared to the national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs), 35-84% and 58-82% compared to the UK DRLs, for ESAK and KAP values, respectively. Regarding the gender of the patients, no statistically significant difference was found in the dose values between female and male patients (Mann-Whitney test, p > 0.05), for all examinations studied. A statistically significant correlation was found between ESAK and KAP values with BMI for KUB AP, pelvis AP, lumbar spine AP, lumbar spine LAT and chest PA, while for chest LAT examinations, only the ESAK were significantly correlated with BMI. They also significantly correlated with the mass for KUB AP, lumbar spine LAT, abdomen PA and chest PA examinations, while no significant correlation was found between the dose values and patients' height. It can be concluded that the low BMI patients received a significantly reduced radiation dose compared to normal patients. Additional studies need to be conducted for these patient groups, which could contribute to the further development of a radiation protection culture in diagnostic radiography.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

3300,"Feasibility of ultra-low dose CT for bronchoscopy of peripheral lung lesions Background and Objective: Three dimensional (3D) thin-section airway CT is essential for identification of small peripheral bronchi during bronchoscopy using radial endobronchial ultrasound. We performed a retrospective study to identify the optimal radiation dose for 3D airway CT during peripheral bronchoscopy. Method(s): In total, 91 patients with peripheral lung lesions underwent 3D airway CT (both standard dose CT as a reference and ultra-low dose CT [LDCT]). The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups according to the ultra-LDCT parameters: group 1 = 120 kVp, 25 mAs; group 2 = 100 kVp, 15 mAs; group 3 = 120 kVp, 5 mAs; and group 4 = 100 kVp, 5 mAs. Two radiologists and two pulmonary physicians analyzed both the standard CT and ultra-LDCT scans independently. Result(s): The effective doses (EDs) of ultra-LDCT significantly differed among the four groups (median EDs were 0.88, 0.34, 0.19, and 0.12 mSv for groups 1-4, respectively; P < 0.001). Median differences in peripheral airway wall thickness were higher in group 4 than in other groups. Bronchus signs on ultra-LDCT in groups 1 and 2 were well correlated with those of the standard dose CT (accuracies of two radiologists and two pulmonary physicians were 95-100%) Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that ultra-LDCT with ED of > 0.34 mSv (ED of group 2) is feasible for peripheral bronchoscopy.",Excluded
1599,"Postirradiation sarcoma of the head and neck: a report of three late sarcomas following therapeutic irradiation for primary malignancies of the paranasal sinus, nasal cavity, and larynx Sarcoma of the head and neck region following irradiation for primary malignancy other than retinoblastoma has rarely been reported. Three cases of postirradiation sarcoma arising in the head and neck region following definitive radiotherapy for primary malignancies of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and larynx are presented. The intervals from initial radiation to diagnosis of sarcoma were 10 years, 10 1/2 years, and 12 1/2 years, respectively. The dosage ranged from 6000--6400 rads using conventional fractionation (1750--1811 ret) on a 60Cobalt teletherapy unit. Methotrexate (25 mg I. V. every three days for seven doses) was utilized during the initial course of radiation in two of the three patients. The cases conform well to established criteria for the diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma. Postirradiation sarcoma of the head and neck region is a remote hazard that must be weighed against the benefits of curative radiation therapy, particularly when treating in the presence of bone disease or when treating retinoblastoma or benign lesions.",Excluded
689,"Expression of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells modulates the responsive to irradiation treatment Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly sensitive to irradiation treatment. Expression of Epstein-Barr virus gene products will affect the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells. Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included
2604,"When is rotational angiography superior to conventional single-plane angiography for planning coronary angioplasty? OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of rotational coronary angiography (RoCA) in the context of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) planning., BACKGROUND: As a diagnostic tool, RoCA is associated with decreased patient irradiation and contrast use compared with conventional coronary angiography (CA) and provides superior appreciation of three-dimensional anatomy. However, its value in PCI remains unknown., METHODS: We studied stable coronary artery disease assessment and PCI planning by interventional cardiologists. Patients underwent either RoCA or conventional CA pre-PCI for planning. These were compared with the referral CA (all conventional) in terms of quantitative lesion assessment and operator confidence. An independent panel reanalyzed all parameters., RESULTS: Six operators performed 127 procedures (60 RoCA, 60 conventional CA, and 7 crossed-over) and assessed 212 lesions. RoCA was associated with a reduction in the number of lesions judged to involve a bifurcation (23 vs. 30 lesions, P < 0.05) and a reduction in the assessment of vessel caliber (2.8 vs. 3.0 mm, P < 0.05). RoCA improved confidence assessing lesion length (P = 0.01), percentage stenosis (P = 0.02), tortuosity (P < 0.04), and proximity to a bifurcation (P = 0.03), particularly in left coronary artery cases. X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, and procedure duration were not significantly different., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with conventional CA, RoCA augments quantitative lesion assessment, enhances confidence in the assessment of coronary artery disease and the precise details of the proposed procedure, but does not affect X-ray dose, contrast agent volume, or procedure duration.

868,"Toxicity Related to Radiotherapy Dose and Targeting Strategy: A Pooled Analysis of Cooperative Group Trials of Combined Modality Therapy for Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer OBJECTIVE: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) was the standard treatment for locally advanced NSCLC (LA-NSCLC). This study was performed to examine thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) parameters and their impact on adverse events (AEs)., METHODS: We collected individual patient data from 3600 patients with LA-NSCLC who participated in 16 cooperative group trials of concurrent CRT. The TRT parameters examined included field design strategy (elective nodal irradiation [ENI] versus involved-field [IF] TRT [IF-TRT]) and TRT dose (60 Gy versus >=60 Gy). The primary end point of this analysis was the occurrence of AEs. ORs for AEs were calculated with univariable and multivariable logistic models., RESULTS: TRT doses ranged from 60 to 74 Gy. ENI was not associated with more grade 3 or higher AEs than IF-TRT was (multivariable OR = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.543-1.102, p = 0.1545). Doses higher than 60 Gy (high-dose TRT) were associated with significantly more grade 3 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.501-2.203, p < 0.0001). In contrast, ENI was associated with significantly more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariable OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.035-1.709, p = 0.0258). Doses higher than 60 Gy were also associated with more grade 4 or higher AEs (multivariate OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.191-1.700, p = 0.0001). Grade 5 AEs plus treatment-related deaths were more frequent with higher-dose TRT (p = 0.0012) but not ENI (p = 0.099)., CONCLUSIONS: For patients with LA-NSCLC treated with concurrent CRT, IF-TRT was not associated with the overall risk of grade 3 or higher AEs but was associated with significantly fewer grade 4 or higher AEs than ENI TRT. This is likely the result of irradiation of a lesser amount of adjacent critical normal tissue. Higher TRT doses were associated significantly with grade 3 or higher and grade 4 or higher AEs. On the basis of these findings and our prior report on survival, CRT using IF-TRT and 60 Gy (conventionally fractionated) were associated with more favorable patient survival and less toxicity than was the use of ENI or higher radiotherapy doses.

1629,"Methods for assessing forward and backward light scatter in patients with cataract PURPOSE: To compare objective methods for assessing backward and forward light scatter and psychophysical tests in patients with cataracts., SETTING: Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom., DESIGN: Prospective case series., METHODS: This study included patients scheduled for cataract surgery. Lens opacities were grouped into predominantly nuclear sclerotic, cortical, posterior subcapsular, and mixed cataracts. Backward light scatter was assessed using a rotating Scheimpflug imaging technique (Pentacam HR), forward light scatter using a straylight meter (C-Quant), and straylight using the double-pass method (Optical Quality Analysis System, point-spread function [PSF] meter). The results were correlated with visual acuity under photopic conditions as well as photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity., RESULTS: The study comprised 56 eyes of 56 patients. The mean age of the 23 men and 33 women was 71 years (range 48 to 84 years). Two patients were excluded. Of the remaining, 15 patients had predominantly nuclear sclerotic cataracts, 13 had cortical cataracts, 11 had posterior subcapsular cataracts, and 15 had mixed cataracts. Correlations between devices were low. The highest correlation was between PSF meter measurements and Scheimpflug measurements (r = 0.32). The best correlation between corrected distance visual acuity was with the PSF meter (r = 0.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Forward and backward light-scatter measurements cannot be used interchangeably. Scatter as an aspect of quality of vision was independent of acuity. Measuring forward light scatter with the straylight meter can be a useful additional tool in preoperative decision-making.

123,"Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the prognostic factors for 840 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma Objective: To investigate the prognostic factors for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who received radiotherapy (RT) and to provide information about improvement in NPC RT techniques. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data from 840 cases of NPC that received RT from January 1996 to December 2001 in our hospital. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the control rate of nasopharynx, the tumor-free survival rate and overall survival. Log-rank test was conducted to determine significance. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to confirm the significance of prognostic factors. Result(s): 1) The total control rates of nasopharynx for 3, 5 and 10 years were 70.6%, 56.7% and 36.6%, respectively. The tumor-free survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 66.8%, 51.8% and 32.0%, respectively. The overall survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 73.8%, 58.6% and 39.4%, respectively. 2) Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, N stage, skull base invasion, cranial nerve invasion, nasal cavity invasion, cervical node metastasis, unilateral/bilateral neck node metastasis, cervical node metastasis position, intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx, external beam radiotherapy method and chemotherapy were significantly associated with the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival, and overall survival (P<0.05). The irradiation dose of nasopharynx was significantly associated with the nasopharynx control rate and overall survival (P<0.05). The tumor-free survival of the patients with carotid sheath involvement was lower than that of the patients without carotid sheath involvement (P<0.05). 3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, unilateral/bilateral cervical node metastasis, and intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx were independent influential factors of the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival. 4) The stratified analysis showed that T2 and T3 patients who received adjuvant high dose intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx presented with a higher control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Male NPC patients with advanced clinical stage (especially T stage) and bilateral cervical node metastasis have a poorer prognosis. Adjuvant intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx can improve the prognosis of T2 and T3 patients.",Excluded
210,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome. Second-look surgery and resection of residual/ refractory tumors is always recommended.",Excluded
1779,"Femoral artery dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs (canis lupus familiaris) Background: In Veterinary Medicine, there are several methods for early and accurate assessment of blood flow dynamics. The Dopplerfluxometry can access the peak systolic velocity, mean velocity and end diastolic velocity, including Resistive Index and Pulsatility Index. Normal values of Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs allow the identification of vascular abnormalities and authors' knowledge there are no reference regarding the values of Dopplerfluxometry of the femoral artery in healthy dogs. The aim of the study was to assess the femoral Dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs by Resistive Index, Pulsatility Index, systolic and diastolic velocities, and femoral artery diameter. Materials, Methods & Results: Eighteen healthy intact beagle dogs, male and female, aging from 2 to 4 years old (mean +/- SD: mean 3 +/- 0.8 years), weighing from 10.1-17.9 kg [22.3-39.5 lb] [mean +/- SD: 14.3 +/- 2.7 kg (31.5 +/- 5.96 lb)] were used. The dogs underwent to physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry examination urinalysis, and radiographs examination, muscular and cardiac evaluation. Females had to be in anestrous. All dogs were submitted to right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry. The dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency by one person without any chemical restraint. A high definition ultrasound device equipped with a 3 - 13 MHz multi-frequency linear transducer was used. The right femoral artery was identified with the transducer positioned transversely on the right triangle femoral area. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity was measured. The Resistivity Index and Pulsatility Index were calculated automatically by the ultrasound machine software. Three measurements were obtained with the Doppler spectrum. The values of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, Resistivity Index, Pulsatility Index and femoral artery diameter were expressed as Mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD). Discussion(s): No studies regarding to femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs were found in the literature. These results can be used as normal reference values of Dopplerfluxometric parameters for adult dogs. The literature cited only Dopplerfluxometric values of renal arteries, abdominal aorta and of the internal thoracic artery. The normal values of arterial Dopplerfluxometry is necessary to identify the spectral quantitative characteristics of the blood flow for diagnosis and prognosis of vascular diseases. Authors referred to changes in blood perfusion by Dopplerfluxometry examination, but no changes in B-mode ultrasonography. The femoral Resistivity Index values can be used to correlate the postoperative evolution in dogs submitted to femoral bone, hip and knee surgeries, since Dopplerfluxometry allows blood flow assessment in the femoral region muscles. Changes in the heart rate, blood pressure, stress, exercise, and diseases as hypotension, renal lesion, hepatic diseases, diabetes, hyperadrenocorticism can change the Dopplerfluxometric parameters. All dogs which used in this study were clinically healthy, and were used beagle dogs due to lowest variations within breed. Sedation was avoid due to possible changes in Dopplerfluxometric parameters since the use of sedation or tranquilization in animals is strongly discussed due to possible hemodynamic changes that may occur during the examination. In conclusion, the mean values of the right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in male and female adult healthy dogs is Resistivity Index (0.887); Pulsatility Index (1.599); peak systolic velocity (124.41 cm/s), end-diastolic velocity (14.12 cm/s), femoral artery diameter (3.9 mm).Copyright © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

2763,"Uncertainty in assessment of radiation-induced diffusion index changes in individual patients The purpose of this study is to evaluate repeatability coefficients of diffusion tensor indices to assess whether longitudinal changes in diffusion indices were true changes beyond the uncertainty for individual patients undergoing radiation therapy (RT). Twenty-two patients who had low-grade or benign tumors and were treated by partial brain radiation therapy (PBRT) participated in an IRB-approved MRI protocol. The diffusion tensor images in the patients were acquired pre-RT, week 3 during RT, at the end of RT, and 1, 6, and 18 months after RT. As a measure of uncertainty, repeatability coefficients (RC) of diffusion indices in the segmented cingulum, corpus callosum, and fornix were estimated by using test-retest diffusion tensor datasets from the National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA) database. The upper and lower limits of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated RC from the test and retest data were used to evaluate whether the longitudinal percentage changes in diffusion indices in the segmented structures in the individual patients were beyond the uncertainty and thus could be considered as true radiation-induced changes. Diffusion indices in different white matter structures showed different uncertainty ranges. The estimated RC for fractional anisotropy (FA) ranged from 5.3% to 9.6%, for mean diffusivity (MD) from 2.2% to 6.8%, for axial diffusivity (AD) from 2.4% to 5.5%, and for radial diffusivity (RD) from 2.9% to 9.7%. Overall, 23% of the patients treated by RT had FA changes, 44% had MD changes, 50% had AD changes, and 50% had RD changes beyond the uncertainty ranges. In the fornix, 85.7% and 100% of the patients showed changes beyond the uncertainty range at 6 and 18 months after RT, demonstrating that radiation has a pronounced late effect on the fornix compared to other segmented structures. It is critical to determine reliability of a change observed in an individual patient for clinical decision making. Assessments of the repeatability and confidence interval of diffusion tensor measurements in white matter structures allow us to determine the true longitudinal change in individual patients.",Excluded

Implantation of estrogen in female chicks induces masculine differentiation of neurons in their song nuclei. The effects of estrogen on neuron size decline steeply after posthatching day 35 when neuronal atrophy begins.

The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
1236,"Altered mechanical behavior of demineralized bone following therapeutic radiation Post-radiotherapy (RTx) bone fragility fractures are a late-onset complication occurring in bone within or underlying the radiation field. These fractures are difficult to predict, as patients do not present with local osteopenia. Using a murine hindlimb RTx model, we previously documented decreased mineralized bone strength and fracture toughness, but alterations in material properties of the organic bone matrix are largely unknown. In this study, 4 days of fractionated hindlimb irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) or Sham irradiation was administered in a mouse model (BALB/cJ, end points: 0, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, n = 15/group/end point). Following demineralization, the viscoelastic stress relaxation, and monotonic tensile mechanical properties of tibiae were determined. Irradiated tibiae demonstrated an immediate (day after last radiation fraction) and sustained (4, 8, 12 weeks) increase in stress relaxation compared to the Sham group, with a 4.4% decrease in equilibrium stress (p <.017). While tensile strength was not different between groups, irradiated tibiae had a lower elastic modulus (-5%, p =.027) and energy to failure (-12.2%, p =.012) with monotonic loading. Gel electrophoresis showed that therapeutic irradiation (4 x 5 Gy) does not result in collagen fragmentation, while irradiation at a common sterilization dose (25 kGy) extensively fragmented collagen. These results suggest that altered collagen mechanical behavior has a role in postirradiation bone fragility, but this can occur without detectable collagen fragmentation. Statement of Clinical Significance: Therapeutic irradiation alters bone organic matrix mechanics and which contribute to diminished fatigue strength, but this does not occur via collagen fragmentation.Copyright © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

840,"Concomitant radiochemotherapy for locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer: tolerance and early results Combination of radio- and chemotherapy is one of the methods which may improve results of treatment in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Currently, the most promising sequence of radio- and chemotherapy is concomitant. In Head and Neck Cancer Department of Cancer Center in Warsaw since 1995 is continued study estimated tolerance and effectiveness of the concomitant radiochemotherapy for patients with locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer. Chemotherapy consist of cisplatinum and 5-fluorouracil in continuous infusion during first week of irradiation followed by 24-hours infusion of 5-fluorouracil one weekly until radiotherapy is finished. Radiotherapy is used with conventional fractionation 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly to total dose 66 Gy. Between October 1995 and September 1998 fifty seven patients with oropharyngeal cancer were entered to study. Tolerance of treatment was acceptable. Complete regression of the tumor was obtained in 41/57 patients (72%). Five other patients after radiotherapy were referred for successful radical neck dissection. Including this group, local control was obtained in 81%. At this moment, 60% of patients are alive without evidence of disease. In 12 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer tolerance of treatment and early results were poor, so the study was stopped in this group.",Excluded
1059,"The outcome of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with in-stent restenosis who failed intracoronary radiation therapy OBJECTIVES: This study reports the outcome of patients who failed intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for the treatment of in-stent restenosis (ISR)., BACKGROUND: Intracoronary radiation therapy has demonstrated a reduction in the recurrence rate of restenosis for patients with ISR. However, 10% to 30% of these patients require repeat intervention to the irradiated site., METHODS: Of 961 patients who were assigned to gamma or beta radiation for the treatment of diffuse ISR, we evaluated the outcome of 282 (29%) consecutive patients who failed IRT and compared them with the 679 (71%) patients who had successful IRT. For patients who failed radiation, the mean time to the first target vessel revascularization (TVR) was 173 +/- 127 days after the index procedure and the total duration of follow-up was 494 +/- 304 days., RESULTS: Patients who failed IRT were younger (60 +/- 10 vs. 63 +/- 11 years, p = 0.002) and had a higher incidence of restenting (51% vs. 41%, p = 0.003). The majority (55%) of the restenotic lesions after IRT failure were focal (< or =10 mm), with a mean lesion length of 11.9 +/- 1.9 mm. Of the 257 patients who had subsequent TVR after failed IRT, 68 (26%) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and 189 (74%) underwent percutaneous coronary intervention using balloon in 61%, restenting in 26%, atheroablation in 11%, and the cutting balloon in 2% of cases. At six months, 6% of patients died, 1% had Q-wave MI, 17% had repeat TVR, and the overall rate of major adverse cardiac events was 21%., CONCLUSIONS: The predominant angiographic pattern of lesions in patients who failed IRT is focal restenosis, with these lesions responding well to conventional revascularization methods.",Excluded
1368,"Incidence of Breast Cancer in the Life Span Study of Atomic Bomb Survivors: 1958-2009 The importance of reproductive history in breast tissue development and etiology of sporadic breast cancer in females is well established. However, there is limited evidence of factors, other than age, that modify risk of radiation-related breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated breast cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors, adding 11 years of follow-up and incorporating reproductive history data. We used Poisson regression models to describe radiation risks and modifying effects of age and reproductive factors. Among 62,534 females, we identified 1,470 breast cancers between 1958 and 2009. Of 397 new cases diagnosed since 1998, 75% were exposed before age 20. We found a strong linear dose response with excess relative risk (ERR) of 1.12 per Gy [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73 to 1.59] for females at age 70 after exposure at age 30. The ERR decreased with increasing attained age ( P = 0.007) while excess absolute rate (EAR) increased with attained age up to age 70 ( P < 0.001). Age at menarche was a strong modifier of the radiation effect: for a given dose, both the ERR and EAR decreased with increasing age at menarche ( P = 0.007 and P < 0.001). Also, independently, age-at-exposure effects on ERR and EAR differed before and after menarche ( P = 0.043 and P = 0.015, respectively, relative to log-linear trends), with highest risks for exposures around menarche. Despite the small number of male breast cancers (n = 10), the data continue to suggest a dose response (ERR per Gy = 5.7; 95% CI: 0.3 to 30.8; P = 0.018). Persistently increased risk of female breast cancer after radiation exposure and its modification pattern suggests heightened breast sensitivity during puberty.",Excluded
2091,"Release of heavy metals from retained lead projectiles and thermometer's mercury To report three cases in which lead (cases 1, 2) and mercury (case 3) were released from retaining tissues without clinical/toxic effects. Cases series: Case 1: a 67-year-old man was hit by 200 pellets in the posterior head, right shoulder and arm. Due to a severe oedema of the arm, a fasciotomy was performed. During the following year the patient remained asymptomatic; blood and urine lead levels, collected every 3 months, resulted 4, 14, 13, 7 mcg/dL (n.v. 0.1-10 mcg/dL) and 19.4, 16.2, 55.6 mcg/L (n.v. 0.5-3.5 mcg/L). Case 2: a 43-year-old man was accidentally hit by 150pellets in the right leg. The patient required emergency surgery; during the following year blood lead levels ranged from 21.7 to 29.7 mcg/dL; the urine lead levels progressively decrease from 17.8 to 2.7 mcg/L. Either in case 1 and 2 red cell zinc-protoporphyrin, urine aminolevulinic-acid and blood film resulted always normal. Case 3: after accidental inoculation of thermometer's mercury a 31- years woman presented local oedema and numerous radio-opaque micro-droplets at the second proximal phalanx of the left hand. After a surgical toilet X-ray showed a diffused foreign material over the second metacarpal joint. During a three years follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic; no biochemical alterations neither modification on radio-opaque material distribution were registered. Blood mercury levels every 6 months resulted 5.0, 1.2, 15.0, 13.0, 4.0, 1.2 and 1.9 mcg/L (n.v. 1.0-4.5 mcg/L); urine mercury levels were 6.5, 1.0, 9.0, 4.0, 6.0, 2.7, 4.5 mcg/L (n.v. 0.1-4.5 mcg/L). Conclusion(s): Overall management of heavy metals prolonged absorption due to retained foreign bodies is not well defined. Metal absorption could be influenced by several and unpredictable factors. Surgical removal may be difficult and incomplete. In our three cases no chelating treatments were required, and only a moderate metal release without any clinical manifestations was documented.",Excluded
219,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded
3114,"Outcomes and toxicities of definitive radiotherapy and reirradiation using 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated (pencil beam) proton therapy for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies Background: Proton therapy (PT) improves outcomes in patients with nasal cavity (NC) and paranasal sinus (PNS) cancers. Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients. Method(s): Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT. Result(s): The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P <.01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P =.01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%). Conclusion(s): PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded

Fifty-two (5%) subjects had significant (>or=50%) diameter stenosis and 21 (2%) had severe (>or=75%) stenosis. Thirteen (25%) and 30 (58%) subjects with significant stenosis were classified into National Cholesterol Education Program low-risk and mild coronary calcification (coronary artery calcium scores <100), respectively. Midterm follow-up (17 +/- 2 months) revealed 15 cardiac events only in those with CAD on CTA: 1 unstable angina requiring hospital stay and 14 revascularization procedures. Most (87%) events occurred within 90 days of index CTA., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of occult CAD in apparently healthy individuals was not negligible, although their midterm prognosis was good. CTA has a potential to provide a better insight about the occult CAD in this population. However, on the basis of our results and considering present radiation exposure data, we cannot recommend that CTA be used as a screening tool for this population at this point.",Excluded
1950,"Feasibility and reproducibility of hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI in the progression of early subclinical atherosclerosis (PESA) study Background: Although hybrid technology using 18F-fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (18F-FDG PET/MRI) can provide in vivo molecular and anatomical information, data are limited regarding multi-territorial evaluation of atherosclerosis. Purpose(s): To assess the feasibility and reproducibility of 18F-FDG PET/MRI to characterize plaque burden, composition and inflammation in subclinical atherosclerosis. Method(s): A total of 938 asymptomatic participants with extensive atherosclerosis (age 48.0+/-4.3 years, 84% men) from the PESA (Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis) study underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI of the carotid arteries, aorta, and ilio-femoral arteries 30 min after 18F-FDG injection (FDG dose 293+/-10.5 MBq, radiation dose 5.6+/-0.2 mSv). Arterial FDG uptake was evaluated on co-registered PET/MRI images using target-to-background ratios (TBR). Atherosclerotic burden was evaluated on T1-weighted MR images (indexed wall volume) and plaque characterization on T1- and T2- weighted MR images (lipidic, fibrous, mixed). Reproducibilities of FDG uptake and atherosclerotic burden/ composition were quantified in 15 PESA participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), kappa and Bland & Altman analysis. Result(s): A total of 842 (89.7%) 18F-FDG PET/MRI studies were available for final analysis (5.9% of which were incomplete, mainly lacking carotid imaging). FDG circulation time was 106.0+/-14.9 min for the ilio-femoral PET and 133.0+/-19.5 min for the carotid-aortic PET. Plaque composition analysis showed a Kappa value of 0.57. ICC of multi-territorial TBR was excellent (0.98; 95% CI of 0.97-0.98). ICC of multi-territorial indexed wall volume was good (0.89; 95% CI of 0.84-0.93). Bland & Altman plots showed good agreement for all explored territories, with mostly narrow confidence intervals (Figure). Conclusion(s): Hybrid 18F-FDG PET/MRI of multi-territory subclinical atherosclerosis in a single setting is feasible and highly reproducible, as demonstrated in the largest cohort ever reported for vascular PET/MRI, allowing multiparametric characterization of plaque burden, composition and inflammation.

2332,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

We postulated that this approach, for the same planned tissue dose of 120 Gy, would increase the embolic load, improve distribution, and result in enhanced tumor response without causing additional adverse events., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2007 and September 2008, 50 patients with extensive tumor burden and/or markedly hypervascular tumors (13 hepatocellular carcinomas, and 37 liver metastases) underwent radioembolization with extended-shelf-life microspheres at a planned dose of 120 Gy. Baseline and follow-up imaging and laboratory data were obtained. Response in the target lesion was assessed with cross-sectional imaging by using World Health Organization (WHO) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines., RESULTS: The mean delivered radiation dose was 126 Gy. The mean increase in embolic load with this approach was 111%, corresponding to an increase from 3.6 to 7.3 million microspheres. Clinical toxicities included fatigue (28 patients, 56%), abdominal pain (19 patients, 38%), and nausea/vomiting (six patients, 12%). Grade 3-4 bilirubin toxicity was seen in one patient. Two gastroduodenal ulcers were observed. With cross-sectional imaging, response rates according to WHO and EASL guidelines were 51% and 69%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the safety and efficacy of extended-shelf-life (90)Y glass microspheres. The increased embolic load and lowered activity per microsphere theoretically resulted in better tumor coverage and, hence, improved response rates. This standardizable treatment paradigm provides a minimally embolic therapy for liver tumors.",Excluded

Symptoms after drug discontinuation were monitored. Ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring was performed on patients, whose symptom recurred within 8 weeks after treatment. BMI, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were detected., RESULTS: Among the 28 patients with GERD, 15 (53.6%) recurred symptoms after withdraw of PPIs. Compared with the asymptomatic group after withdraw of PPIs, the pretreatment duration of pH 4 (supine), 24 h total acid reflux time, number of time periods with acid reflux > 5 minutes, the maximal acid reflux time and 24 h total number of acid reflux in the symptomatic recurrence group were statistically significantly increased (11.7% vs 4.5%, 138.8 minutes vs 62.1 minutes, 6.0 vs 2.0, 27.0 minutes vs 12.4 minutes, 74.0 times vs 43.0 times, respectively, all P values < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, SAS and SDS between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: The basic level of esophageal acid exposure of patients with GERD before PPIs therapy may influence the esophageal acid exposure after PPIs therapy and then may affect the recurrence of symptoms. Although anxiety and depression is common in patients with GERD, it is not found that the recurrence of acid-related symptoms after the discontinuation of PPIs therapy is related to the anxiety and depression.",Excluded
615,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice. Routine radiographs most specifically document mature ossifications.",Excluded

Results Of the 130 eligible patients screened, 40 patients were randomized. The technical success was comparable between early and late group. The ERC time was less and the fluoroscopy time and radiation dose were significantly less in the early group (4 minutes [3, 6] vs. 15 minutes [8, 28], p=0.001) and (1.35 mGy [0.90, 1.63] vs. 2.40 mGy [1.58, 3.25], p=0.010) respectively. In the late group, 60 % required need for rescue pre-cut fistulotomy. One patient from late group developed PEP while 1 from early developed perforation. Three needed other interventions due to failed second attempt. Conclusion Early pre-cut fistulotomy has comparable technical success and reduces the time and dose of fluoroscopy as compared to late pre-cut fistulotomy for difficult biliary cannulation.",Excluded
3084,"Early changes in the operated and adjacent segments after anterior cervical microdiscectomy and interbody fusion with poly one (PEEK) cage containing synthetic bone particulate: A prospective study of 20 cases Objective: To evaluate the effects of implantation of PEEK cage containing synthetic bone particulate on the height and cross-sectional area of the foramen, the intervertebral disc height and the degree of lordosis in the treatment of cervical disc disease. Method(s): Twenty patients, with cervical disc herniation were operated a standard cervical microdiscectomy.

3234,"Pathogen reduction by ultraviolet C light effectively inactivates human white blood cells in platelet products BACKGROUND: Residual white blood cells (WBCs) in cellular blood components induce a variety of adverse immune events, including nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions, alloimmunization to HLA antigens, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Pathogen reduction (PR) methods such as the ultraviolet C (UVC) light-based THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system were developed to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. As UVC light targets nucleic acids, it interferes with the replication of both pathogens and WBCs. This preclinical study aimed to evaluate the ability of UVC light to inactivate contaminating WBCs in platelet concentrates (PCs)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo function of WBCs from UVC-treated PCs was compared to that of WBCs from gamma-irradiated and untreated PCs by measuring cell viability, proliferation, cytokine secretion, antigen presentation in vitro, and xenogeneic GVHD responses in a humanized mouse model., RESULTS: UVC light was at least as effective as gamma irradiation in preventing GVHD in the mouse model. It was more effective in suppressing T-cell proliferation (>5-log reduction in the limiting dilution assay), cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation than gamma irradiation., CONCLUSIONS: The THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (MacoPharma) PR system can substitute gamma irradiation for TA-GVHD prophylaxis in platelet (PLT) transfusion. Moreover, UVC treatment achieves suppression of antigen presentation and inhibition of cytokine accumulation during storage of PCs, which has potential benefits for transfusion recipients.

1566,"Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition in a cohort of 52 patients with Gitelman Syndrome Background: Gitelman syndrome (GS) is a rare recessively inherited tubulop-athy, caused by inactive mutations in SLC12A3 gene encoding the thiazide-sensi-tive-sodium-chloride transporter. It is characterized by an hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. Calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition is frequently described in GS case-reports but its prevalence and clinical phenotype are unknown. Objective(s): The aim is to describe clinical, biological and radiological features of CPP in a cohort of patients with genetically proven GS. Method(s): All patients (pts) with genetically proven GS in the French national reference center of rare diseases were proposed to have a consultation with a senior rheumatologist. Demographic data, history of joint pain and flare and biology disorders were recorded. Other causes of CPP disease were systematically ruled out. CPP crystal deposition was assessed by X-rays (all peripheral joints and cervical spine) and ultrasonography (US) (wrist, knee, ankle joints and symptomatic joints). Patients with history of cervical pain underwent computed tomography (CT) of the full cervical spine from occipital bone to C1-T1 disk, including temporomandibular joints. Result(s): Fifty-two GS pts (21 men, mean age 46.5+/- 12.2 years) have been examined by a rheumatologist. Almost all patients had an heterozygous mutation on SLC12A3 gene. Forty-four pts experienced joint pain (84.6%), 23 joint flares (44,2%) and 25 cervical pain (48.1%). X-rays were performed in 42 pts, US in 38 and CT in 23. CPP depositions were observed in 36 (85.7%), 27 (71.1%) and 15 pts (65.2%) by X-rays, US and CT, respectively. All techniques combined, chondrocalcinosis was discovered in 42 patients. Deposits occurred in knees (n=32), wrists (n=29), cervical spine (n=23), ankles and feet (n=22) and shoulders (n=16). CPP depositions were widespread involving at least 3 joints in 27 (55.1%) pts. In knees, CPP depositions involved menisci (n=24), hyaline cartilages (n=16) and ligament or joint capsule (n=15). Cervical spine CT demonstrated CPP deposition in vertebral discs (n=17), transverse ligament (n=13), other ligament (n=13), vertebral facets (n=3) and temporo-mandibular joints (n=5). Patients with CPP crystal deposition in more than 3 joints were significantly older (52.8+/-10.5 years) than patients with 2 or 3 affected joints (40.8+/-11.6 years, p=0.02) or patients without any affected joint (36.6+/-8.1 years, p=0.001). They were also more symptomatic with significantly more joint flares (p<0.0001). Mag-nesemia was inversely correlated with the number of affected joints: patients with >3 or 2-3 affected joints had a significantly lower magnesemia (0.57+/-0.1 and 0.59 +/-0.1 mM, respectively) than patients with only 1 affected joint (0.83+/-0.1 mM). CPP crystal deposition was not associated with potassium level. (Table Presented).",Excluded
444,"A comparison of thoracic CT and abdominal CT for the identification of thoracic blunt trauma BACKGROUND: In light of current trends to limit radiation exposure and costs, as well as increased traffic safety, computed tomography (CT) may have decreasing value for evaluating patients with blunt trauma. The authors examined the utility of chest x-ray and abdominal CT for identifying clinically significant thoracic blunt trauma., METHODS: In this prospective study, findings on thoracic CT, abdominal CT, and chest x-ray from trauma patients were compared to assess injury prevalence and relevance to treatment outcomes., RESULTS: Four hundred forty-four patients were identified, of whom 76% had no findings. Occult findings had significantly lower Injury Severity Scores. All clinically relevant pneumothoraces and most other injuries could be identified without thoracic CT. Two of 3 aortic abnormalities were suspected from chest x-ray., CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant injuries can be identified with abdominal CT and chest x-ray, safely allowing reductions in radiation exposure, hospital stays, and costs by limiting the use of thoracic CT.

2868,"Results of adjuvant radiochemotherapy for gastric adenocarcinoma in Slovenia Aims: To analyze the results of postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-florouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) in patients with gastric carcinoma treated in a single institution. Method(s): During 2001-2004, 123 patients with the mean age of 60 years, were treated for adenocarcinoma of the stomach, stage Ib-IV, with postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy. Radical (R0) and non-radical (R1) resection of the tumor was performed in 107 and 16 patients, respectively. Adjuvant treatment consisted of five cycles of five-day chemotherapy with 5-FU (425 mg/m2) and LV (20 mg/m2) and concomitant radiotherapy with the total dose of 45 Gy. Result(s): The treatment was completed according to the protocol in 101 patients. Stomatitis, dysphagia, and nausea and vomiting of grade three occurred in 32, 27, and 23 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time of 87 survivors was 30.4 months (range 17.4-58.3 months). At two years, locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 65%, 74%, and 73%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the initial Hb level was identified as independent prognostic factor for all survival four endpoints, the involvement of whole stomach with cancer for LRC, the total dose of 5-FU per five-day cycle for DFS, and pT stage for DSS. Conclusion(s): In operable gastric carcinoma, postoperative concomitant radiochemotherapy with 5-FU and LV is feasible and its toxicity acceptable. Its potential to improve the treatment outcome compared to the surgery alone is yet to be tested in well designed prospective randomized studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
6,"Image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced gastric cancer: a clinical feasibility study BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the medical and technical feasibility of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in high-risk nonmetastatic gastric cancer stage II and III after primary gastrectomy and D2 lymphadenectomy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A prospective nonrandomized phase II trial was performed on 25 consecutive patients with gastric cancer with high risk (T3-4, N1-3, G2-3, R0-1). The dose delivered was 45 Gy (1.80 Gy per fraction) in IMRT technique. Concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy at 225 mg/m(2) was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Primary endpoints were acute gastrointestinal toxicity (CTC 4.0) and technical feasibility of IMRT in regard to dose planning and radiation delivery., RESULTS: Early acute events were defined as clinical and chemical adverse effects of IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy during treatment. By definition, 90 days after the end of IMRT has been evaluated as acute-phase toxicity. No patient had grade 4 or higher acute adverse events. Clinical grade 3 toxicity occurred in two patients (8%) with diarrhea and in one case (4%) with nausea. Hematological changes with grade 3 occurred in three cases (12%) with hemoglobin decrease, in five cases (25%) as leukopenia, and in one case (4%) with thrombocytopenia. The mean dose for liver was 16 Gy and the percentage volume exceeding 30 Gy (V30) was 21%. Mean dose for right and left kidney was 9 and 13 Gy, respectively, and V20 was 9% and 13%, respectively. Heart received a median dose of 15 Gy and V40 was 17%. The mean dose to the bowel was 11 Gy and V40 was 6%. Spinal cord had at maximum 33 Gy in median. Specifics of dose distribution, including the coverage, for the target region were as follows: minimum was 33 Gy, maximum 48.6 Gy, and mean dose 44.6 Gy. The prescribed dose (45 Gy) covered 99% and 95% of planning target volume (OTV) in 66% and 92% of cases, respectively. Median PTV was 15.77 ml (range, 805-3,604 ml)., CONCLUSIONS: The data support the practical feasibility of IMRT in adjuvant treatment in high-risk gastric cancer in the postoperative setting as a proof of principle. Acute toxicity has been tolerable.",Excluded
552,"Estimating the risk of cancer and the hazardous index due to radiation from the phosphate mine in Russifa area Phosphate mines are considered prone to high radioactivity. The Russifa area contains one of the largest phosphate mines in Jordan.

These values exceed the permissible levels in residential areas. The annual radiation doses at the site equals 36.4 and 30.1 mSv for the phosphate pile and zoo, respectively and these values pose a significant risk on the nearby population. Cancer risk is high in all body tissues, especially in the colon for both males and females. It is therefore imperative that these sites be rehabilitated and with a priority objective to reduce the annual dose rate to permissible levels and consequently the risk of cancer.",Included
2442,"Clinical experience with a 3D surface patient setup system for alignment of partial-breast irradiation patients Purpose: To assess the utility of surface imaging on patient setup for accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). Methods and Material: A photogrammetry system was used in parallel to APBI setup by laser and portal imaging. Surface data were acquired after laser and port-film setup for 9 patients. Surfaces were analyzed in comparison to a reference surface from the first treatment session by use of rigid transformations. The surface model after laser setup was used in a simulated photogrammetry setup procedure. In addition, breathing data were acquired by surface acquisition at a frame rate of 7 Hz. Result(s): Mean 3D displacement was 7.3 mm (SD, 4.4 mm) and 7.6 mm (SD, 4.2 mm) for laser and port film, respectively. Simulated setup with the photogrammetry system yielded mean displacement of 1 mm (SD, 1.2 mm). Distance analysis resulted in mean distances of 3.7 mm (SD, 4.9 mm), 4.3 mm (SD, 5.6 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD, 2.4 mm) for laser, port film, and photogrammetry, respectively. Breathing motion at isocenter was smaller than 3.7 mm, with a mean of 1.9 mm (SD, 1.1 mm). Conclusion(s): Surface imaging for PBI setup appears promising. Alignment of the 3D breast surface achieved by stereo-photogrammetry shows greater breast topology congruence than when patients are set up by laser or portal imaging. A correlation of breast surface and CTV must be quantitatively established. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
69,"Changes in boundary extension effect during spatial confinement Changes in perception during space missions are usually attributed to microgravity. However, additional factors, such as spatial confinement, may contribute to changes in perception. We tested changes in scene perception using a boundary extension (BE) paradigm during a 105-day Earth-based space-simulation study. In addition to the close-up/wide-angle views used in BE, we presented two types of scenes based on the distance from the observer (proximal/distant scenes). In crew members (n = 6), we found that BE partly increased over time, but the size of BE error did not change in the control group (n = 22). We propose that this effect is caused by an increasing BE effect in stimuli that depict distant scenes and is related to spatial confinement. The results might be important for other situations of spatial confinement with restricted visual depth (e.g., submarine crew, patients confined to a bed). Generally, we found a larger BE effect in proximal scenes compared with the distant scenes. We also demonstrated that with no feedback, subjects preserve the level of the BE effect during repeated measurements. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Excluded

Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process.

579,"Selecting the best noninvasive imaging test to guide treatment after an inconclusive exercise test Opinion statement: The first step towards approaching a patient with an inconclusive stress test is to identify the initial reason why a stress test was ordered and examine what factors led to inconclusive test results. Next, it is important to ask whether the patient will benefit from further testing, as not all patients with inconclusive test results require additional testing. In patients who are at low-to-intermediate risk, it may be useful to perform coronary CT angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Among individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease, a possible advantage of CTA is that if subclinical atherosclerosis is identified, intensification of lifestyle interventions, and often pharmacotherapy, should be advocated. On the other hand, in high-risk patients or individuals that already have coronary artery disease, the primary objective is to quantify the presence and magnitude of ischemia in order to define the potential role of coronary revascularization procedures. This can be achieved by myocardial perfusion imaging using nuclear imaging or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, a functional evaluation to identify stress-induced wall motion abnormalities using stress echocardiography or MRI can be obtained. In selecting which test to obtain, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of different imaging tests and to consider patient factors (e.g., body habitus) that may influence the accuracy of various tests. In addition, physicians should consider whether there are any other clinical questions that require imaging. For instance, cardiac MRI may be used to evaluate for infiltrative myocardial disease or pericardial disease whereas cardiac CT can evaluate for lung pathology or diseases of the aorta. Finally, any decision regarding what type of additional testing to obtain should also be based on knowing the local expertise and availability of various testing options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

Method(s): Eighty-six PELDs performed by a single surgeon were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were separated into 2 groups: group A (using a three-dimensional [3D]-printed navigation instrument and fluoroscopy-based navigation system) and group B (with conventional fluoroscopy and standard instrumentation). The operation, fluoroscopy, and total access time were collected, as well as fluoroscopy and access times. Result(s): The operative time for group A was 59 minutes (standard deviation [SD], 6 minutes) and 106 minutes (SD, 15 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). In group A, fluoroscopy was used an average of 5 times (SD, 0.7) and 29 times (SD, 8) in group B (P < 0.001). The fluoroscopy time was 9 minutes (SD, 2 minutes) in group A and 40 minutes (SD, 8 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). The number of access attempts was 1.3 (SD, 0.5) in group A and 8 (SD, 2 times) in group B (P < 0.001). The total access time was 11 minutes (SD, 2 minutes) in group A and 28 minutes (SD, 5 minutes) in group B (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): PELD using the fluoroscopy-based navigation system showed lower operative, fluoroscopy, and access time compared with conventional techniques. In addition, fewer fluoroscopy images and access attempts were made in the navigation group. These data suggest that this novel technique reduces fluoroscopy and operation time and may reduce risks of repeated surgical access attempts.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

The effect of amino acid (AA) co-infusion on renal and tumour uptake was assessed in a cross-over randomised setting. Five regimens were tested: no infusion, 4-h infusion of 120 g mixed AA (26.4 g l-lysine + l-arginine), 4 h l-lysine (50 g), 10 h 240 g mixed AA (52.8 g l-lysine + l-arginine) and 4 h Lys-Arg (25 g each). Comparisons were performed on an intra-patient basis. Infusions of AA started 0.5 h prior to injection of (86)Y-SMT487 and PET scans were obtained at 4, 24 and 48 h p.i. Absorbed doses to tissues were computed using the MIRD3 method. (86)Y-SMT487 displayed rapid plasma clearance and exclusive renal excretion; uptake was noted in kidneys, tumours, spleen and, to a lesser extent, liver. The 4-h mixed AA co-infusion significantly ( P<0.05) reduced (86)Y-SMT487 renal uptake by a mean of 21%. This protective effect was significant on the dosimetry data (3.3+/-1.3 vs 4.4+/-1.0 mGy/MBq; P<0.05) and was further enhanced upon prolonging the infusion to 10 h (2.1+/-0.4 vs 1.7+/-0.2 mGy/MBq; P<0.05). Infusion of Lys-Arg but not of l-lysine was more effective in reducing renal uptake than mixed AA. Infusion of AA did not result in reduced tumour uptake. The amount of (90)Y-SMT487 (maximum allowed dose: MAD) that would result in a 23-Gy cut-off dose to kidneys was calculated for each study: MAD was higher with mixed AA co-infusion by a mean of 46% (10-114%, P<0.05 vs no infusion). In comparison with 4 h mixed AA, the MAD was higher by a mean of 23% (9-37%; P<0.05) with prolonged infusion and by a mean of 16% (2-28%; P<0.05) with Lys-Arg. We conclude that infusion of large amounts of AA reduces renal exposure during peptide-based radiotherapy and allows higher absorbed doses to tumours. The prolongation of the infusion from 4 to 10 h further enhances the protective effect on the kidneys.",Excluded
361,"Late side effects of radioactive iodine on salivary gland function in patients with thyroid cancer BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the late side effects of radioiodine therapy (RIT) on salivary gland function. One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

2274,"Is it possible to avoid hypopituitarism after the irradiation of pituitary adenomas by the Leksell gamma-knife? Radiation therapy is used in the treatment of pituitary adenomas, especially in failures of neurosurgery and pharmacotherapy to reduce the size of adenomas and normalize their hypersecretion. Conventional fractionated radiotherapy has achieved good results, but only after a long latency, with considerable postradiation morbidity and with very frequent appearance of hypopituitarism. The focal stereotactic targeting allowed by Leksell gamma-knife (LGK) was supposed to decrease the incidence of hypopituitarism, however our first patients treated by LGK developed hypopituitarism in 38.2%. Consequently, we have analyzed factors leading to this unfavorable outcome and suggested that the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue is the most important cause of hypopituitarism. Result(s): Seventy-five patients (47 women and 28 men) with pituitary adenomas (39 with acromegaly, 17 prolactinomas, 8 with Cushing's disease, 1 with Nelson's syndrome and 9 functionless adenomas), where the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary tissue was measured, were followed 60-180 (mean 91.1) months. In 41 patients, the mean dose of irradiation on pituitary was more than 15 Gy. The hypopituitarism at least in one axis developed in 29 (70.7%) patients during 10-126 months after the irradiation. In 34 patients, the mean dose on pituitary was less than 15 Gy. Only one patient (1.2%) developed hypopituitarism 12 months after the irradiation. This patient had undergone two previous pituitary surgeries and had already central hypothyreosis when irradiated. Conclusion(s): To avoid hypopituitarism the radiation dose of 15 Gy is the maximum safe limit of the mean dose of radiation to the pituitary tissue surrounding the adenoma. This cut off should become a rule when irradiating pituitary adenomas - just like the dose rules of 7 Gy on the optical tract or 14 Gy on the brainstem.",Excluded
3263,"Salivary anionic changes after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A 1-year prospective study Objectives: To investigate the salivary anionic changes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

In the capacity of additional tests, loading tests involving in vitro irradiation at the dose of 1 Gy of a suspension of lymphocytes and incubations for 5 and 24 hours were used. Activation of the initial apoptotic and necrotic death of peripheral blood lymphocytes was revealed in the persons chronically exposed to low-intensity radiation within the range from 0.01 to 4.23 Gy. Exposed patients demonstrated a decrease in the number of CD95(+)-cells as compared to unexposed patients. The results of the cell death studies in the persons residing in the Techa riverside villages testify indirectly to the genomic instability of the peripheral blood lymphocytes.",Excluded
2158,"Outcomes of Radiotherapy for Osseous Echinococcosis of Meriones meridianus Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

1071,"Consequences of the radiation accident at the Mayak production association in 1957 (the 'Kyshtym Accident') This paper presents an overview of the nuclear accident that occurred at the Mayak Production Association (PA) in the Russian Federation on 29 September 1957, often referred to as 'Kyshtym Accident', when 20 MCi (740 PBq) of radionuclides were released by a chemical explosion in a radioactive waste storage tank. 2 MCi (74 PBq) spread beyond the Mayak PA site to form the East Urals Radioactive Trace (EURT). The paper describes the accident and gives brief characteristics of the efficacy of the implemented protective measures that made it possible to considerably reduce doses to the exposed population. The paper also provides retrospective dosimetry estimates for the members of the EURT Cohort (EURTC) which comprises approximately 21 400 people. During the first two years after the accident a decrease in the group average leukocyte (mainly due to neutrophils and lymphocytes) and thrombocyte count was observed in the population. At later dates an increased excess relative risk of solid cancer incidence and mortality was found in the EURTC.",Excluded

2814,"Proton-beam therapy for olfactory neuroblastoma PURPOSE: To analyze the feasibility and efficacy of proton-beam therapy (PBT) for olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) as a definitive treatment, by reviewing our preliminary experience. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare disease, and a standard treatment strategy has not been established. Radiation therapy for ONB is challenging because of the proximity of ONBs to critical organs. Proton-beam therapy can provide better dose distribution compared with X-ray irradiation because of its physical characteristics, and is deemed to be a feasible treatment modality., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review was performed on 14 patients who underwent PBT for ONB as definitive treatment at the National Cancer Center Hospital East (Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan) from November 1999 to February 2005. A total dose of PBT was 65 cobalt Gray equivalents (Gy(E)), with 2.5-Gy(E) once-daily fractionations., RESULTS: The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 40 months. One patient died from disseminated disease. There were two persistent diseases, one of which was successfully salvaged with surgery. The 5-year overall survival rate was 93%, the 5-year local progression-free survival rate was 84%, and the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 71%. Liquorrhea was observed in one patient with Kadish's stage C disease (widely destroying the skull base). Most patients experienced Grade 1 to 2 dermatitis in the acute phase. No other adverse events of Grade 3 or greater were observed according to the RTOG/EORTC acute and late morbidity scoring system., CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results of PBT for ONB achieved excellent local control and survival outcomes without serious adverse effects. Proton-beam therapy is considered a safe and effective modality that warrants further study.",Excluded
294,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

3219,"Changes in liver stiffness using acoustic radiation force impulse imaging in patients with obstructive cholestasis and cholangitis Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging is used to assess stages of liver fibrosis. The aim of our study was to evaluate liver stiffness changes in patients with biliary obstruction with or without sclerosing cholangitis after biliary drainage. Method(s): A total of 71 patients were enrolled in this prospective study (cohort N= 51, control group N= 20); 51 patients with obstructive cholestasis, indicated for endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, received stiffness measurement by acoustic radiation force impulse imaging before and 1-2 days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography. Seventeen patients with obstructive cholestasis had primary or secondary sclerosing cholangitis. Forty one patients had a follow-up acoustic radiation force impulse imaging measurement after 3.0 +/- 9.31 weeks. Result(s): In all patients with obstructive cholestasis, stiffness decreased significantly after biliary drainage (p< 0.001). The main decrease was observed within 2 days after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (1.92-1.57 m/s, p< 0.001) and correlated with the decrease of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (p= 0.04 and p= 0.002, respectively). In patients with sclerosing cholangitis, the initial decrease of stiffness after biliary drainage was weaker than in those without (2.1-1.85 m/s vs. 1.81-1.43 m/s, p= 0.016). Conclusion(s): Acoustic radiation force impulse imaging elastography shows that liver stiffness is increased by biliary obstruction, and decreases after endoscopic retrograde cholangiography irrespective of the aetiology. In patients with sclerosing cholangitis the reduction in stiffness after biliary drainage is impaired. © 2014 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.",Excluded
2010,"The metabolic effects of abdominal irradiation in man with and without dietary therapy with an elemental diet The metabolic effects of abdominal radiotherapy were assessed in patients with pelvic neoplasms, and the effects of supplementation of the diet with an 'elemental' diet assessed. Therapeutic irradiation led to significant mean weight losses of 1.4 kg in control patients and 1.0 kg in patients receiving 'elemental' diet supplements. Irradiation was associated with small falls in plasma potassium and calcium concentrations in both groups. In the 'elemental' group there was a small increase in circulating alanine and insulin concentrations and a fall in glycerol and ketone body concentrations, but all variables remained within or close to normal basal reference ranges. Plasma albumin fell slightly but significantly in the 'elemental' diet group from 44 +/- 1 to 42 +/- 1 g/litre during treatment. Is is concluded that modern radiotherapy is no more than a modest catabolic stimulus. Long-term dietary supplementation with 'elemental' diets in ill subjects did not produce adverse effects.",Excluded
1389,"Treatment of squamous cell anal canal carcinoma (SCACC) with pulsed dose rate brachytherapy: A retrospective study Background and purpose: To evaluate the results of pulsed dose rate brachytherapy (PDR) in SCACC. Material(s) and Method(s): From 1996 to 2002, 71 patients (pts) with SCACC were treated with PDR brachytherapy. The median age was 61.2 years (35-88), with a sex ratio of 1 M/6.5 F. The TNM classification was: 14 T1, 41 T2, 15 T3 and 1 T4, 52 N0, 13 N1, 3 N2 and 3 N3. All the pts were M0. Treatment started with external beam irradiation to the posterior pelvis (mean dose: 45.5 Gy). Forty-seven patients received chemotherapy (neoadjuvant/concomitant or both). After an interval of 2-6 weeks, PDR interstitial brachytherapy was performed. The mean dose was 17.8 Gy to the 85% reference isodose of the Paris system. Result(s): Treatment was interrupted in only one pt. With a median follow-up of 28.5 months, 2-year actuarial overall survival was 90%. Fourteen relapses occurred (four distant, three regional, and seven local). Ten patients developed a grade III complication (Lent Soma scale) and two a grade IV complication (colostomy or abdominal perineal resection for necrosis).

941,"Age at exposure to ionising radiation and cancer mortality among Hanford workers: Follow up through 1994 Background: Studies of workers at the plutonium production factory in Hanford, WA have led to conflicting conclusions about the role of age at exposure as a modifier of associations between ionising radiation and cancer. Aim(s): To evaluate the influence of age at exposure on radiation risk estimates in an updated follow up of Hanford workers. Method(s): A cohort of 26 389 workers hired between 1944 and 1978 was followed through 1994 to ascertain vital status and causes of death. External radiation dose estimates were derived from personal dosimeters. Poisson regression was used to estimate associations between mortality and cumulative external radiation dose at all ages, and in specific age ranges. Result(s): A total of 8153 deaths were identified, 2265 of which included cancer as an underlying or contributory cause. Estimates of the excess relative risk per Sievert (ERR/Sv) for cumulative radiation doses at all ages combined were negative for all cause and leukaemia and positive for all cancer and lung cancer. Cumulative doses accrued at ages below 35, 35-44, and 45-54 showed little association with mortality. For cumulative dose accrued at ages 55 and above (10 year lag), the estimated ERR/Sv for all cancers was 3.24 (90% CI: 0.80 to 6.17), primarily due to an association with lung cancer (ERR/Sv. 9.05, 90% CI: 2.96 to 17.92). Conclusion(s): Associations between radiation and cancer mortality in this cohort are primarily a function of doses at older ages and deaths from lung cancer. The association of older age radiation exposures and cancer mortality is similar to observations from several other occupational studies.",Included
2013,"Radiation-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Cranial nerve palsy is a rare complication after patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receive radiotherapy using a technique that delivers 180-200 centigrays (cGy) per day. Cranial neuropathy is of particular clinical interest in terms of making a differential diagnosis, because it is also a common presenting manifestation in patients with NPC. Cranial neuropathy may lead to distressing signs and symptoms in these patients, and their treatment has not been addressed in previous reports. This article presents the authors' experience with radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy in patients with NPC., METHODS: Nineteen patients were diagnosed with radiation-related neuropathy. Patients with recurrent tumors or with a suspicion of persistent or recurrent tumors were excluded. Most patients were treated using 180 cGy or 200 cGy per fraction per day. The total dose was 7000-13,000 cGy to the nasopharynx and 5000-9000 cGy to the neck. Unilateral vocal cord paralysis alone and hearing loss were not included in the analysis., RESULTS: There were 15 male patients and 4 female patients. The latency before palsy occurred was 12-240 months. Single nerve palsy developed in four patients, including two patients with hypoglossal palsy and two patients with recurrent laryngeal palsy. Two patients had three nerve palsies each. The other 13 patients presented with 2 nerve palsies each. Vagus and hypoglossal palsy appeared to be a frequent combination and occurred in 11 patients. Overall, there were 17 patients with hypoglossal palsy (7 bilateral, 8 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 11 patients with vagus palsy (2 bilateral, 7 left-sided, and 2 right-sided), 6 patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (5 bilateral), and 2 patients with accessory palsies (all bilateral). Marked neck fibrosis was present in 12 patients. Patients who had vocal cord paralysis suffered from easy choking and hoarseness. Severe respiratory difficulty occurred in two patients who had bilateral vocal cord palsy. Surgical procedures included laryngoplasty, tracheostomy, and gastrostomy. Quality of life improved considerably after patients underwent surgery., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy-related cranial nerve palsy may occur in patients with NPC after they receive conventional radiotherapy. Hypoglossal nerve palsy was found the most frequently in this series, followed by vagus nerve palsy and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Neck fibrosis and the course of the three nerves through the neck may be important risk factors for the development of palsy. The diagnosis must be made only after the possibilities of tumor-induced palsy and idiopathic palsy are excluded. Surgery is helpful in improving the quality of life in many patients.

1839,"Radiotherapeutic factors affecting the incidence of developing hypothyroidism after radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell cancer PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine radiotherapy (RT) dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced hypothyroidism (HT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of HT in 78 HNSCC patients treated with RT was based on a thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level greater than the maximum value of laboratory range. In all patients, dose-volumetric parameters were analyzed according to their relation to development of HT, and thyroid volumes spared from doses >=10, 20, 30, 40 and 50Gy (V10, V20, V30, V40 and V50) were analyzed from the dose volume histograms (DVHs)., RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 31months. At the end of study, 33 patients (42.3%) developed HT and the cumulative incidence of HT was 24.6%, 36.5% and 42.3% at one, two and three years, respectively. V30 of 42.1% (P=0.005) was defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT in HNSCC patients. Our analysis showed that V30 separates patients into low- and high-risk groups; the incidence of radiation-induced HT in the group with V30<42.1% and V30>=42.1% was 29.4% and 71.4%, respectively (P=0.002)., CONCLUSIONS: The V30 may predict risk of developing HT after RT for HNSCC patients. V30 of 42.1%, defined as dose-volumetric threshold of radiation-induced HT, can be useful in treatment planning of HNSCC patients. Copyright © 2018 National Cancer Institute, Cairo University.

Moreover, the SIPA1 -313GG was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for PFS in the cohort. Our results indicate, for the first time, that the SIPA1 -313A>G may have a prognostic role in unresected NSCLC making it a potential predictor of poor survival due to earlier progression.Copyright © 2014, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded
285,"Sonographic assessment of acute changes in plaque size and echogenicity and in intima-media thickness of carotid arteries after neck radiation therapy Ultrasonic assessment of acute changes in carotid artery walls before and after neck radiation therapy (RT). Fifty cancer patients scheduled for curative neck irradiation were included and underwent sonographic examination of carotid arteries, with assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaque size and echogenicity before and immediately after completion of RT. IMT was linearly correlated with age and before RT (r = 0.267, p = 0.007) and increased after RT (0.68 +/- 0.11 versus 0.87 +/- 0.16, p < 0.001), without correlation with total RT dose and protocol. New plaques (six hypoechoic, one hyperechoic, and one calcified) were found in eight patients after RT, while 17 of the 44 plaques that were present before RT increased in size, and 8 soft and 1 dense plaques in nine patients became calcified. Radiation in the acute phase not only increases the IMT but also causes new plaque formation and changes in plaque size and echogenicity. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2706,"Robustness of IMPT treatment plans with respect to inter-fractional set-up uncertainties: Impact of various beam arrangements for cranial targets In the current study IMPT plan robustness was evaluated with respect to inter-fractional patient positioning for various beam arrangements and two tumor indications in the cranial region. Material and methods. For 14 patients suffering from tumors in the cranial region [skull base (SB; n = 7) and paranasal sinus (PS; n = 7)] the CTV and OARs were delineated. A safety margin of 3 mm was applied to the CTV. A prescribed dose of 2 GyE was planned via three beam arrangements (alpha, beta, gamma). Beam arrangement alpha consisted of lateral opposed fields for both tumor groups while beam arrangement beta was optimized according to respective tumor and OAR locations, using two beams only. Beam arrangement gamma applied four beams in the SB group and three beams in the PS group. Dose distributions were recalculated subjected to virtual patient translations along the major anatomical axes. The following dosimetric indices were evaluated and compared to original plans: target coverage (TC), target dose homogeneity (HI), CTV median and average dose (Dmedian, Dmean). For OARs near maximum dose and average dose (D2%, Dmean) were evaluated. Results. Dose distributions were distorted after introducing shifts. In the SB group, TC and HI were significantly different for caudal, cranial and anterior shifts for all beam arrangements. For PS patients, all but right shifts differed significantly from the original plans for all beam arrangements, although clinical relevance was not reached for arrangement gamma (DELTATC < 1.5%). In general, beam arrangement gamma exhibited the least spread of data regarding target indices and was consequently considered the most robust. Dosimetric parameters regarding the brainstem were mostly influenced by shifts along the anterio-posterior axis. Conclusion. For cranial IMPT, set-up uncertainties may lead to pronounced deterioration of dose distributions. According to our investigations, multi-beam arrangements were dosimetrically more robust and hence preferable over two beam arrangements. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
3378,"Antegrade wire escalation for chronic total occlusions in coronary arteries: Simple algorithms as a key to success Aims: Antegrade wire escalation (AWE) remains the method of choice for tackling chronic total occlusions (CTOs), especially for lesions with low J-CTO score. To increase the number of operators which treat CTOs and increase AWE success rates, there is a need for a clear, algorithmic approach. We report the results of a simple AWE algorithm with new guidewire technology in coronary CTOs. Method(s): Hundred consecutive CTO lesions selected for AWE as the primary strategy were included in five Benelux centers. The algorithm follows a step-wise increase in guidewire tip load. Lesions were categorized according to the J-CTO score. Primary endpoint was successful guidewire crossing. Result(s): No differences in baseline demographics were present between successful and unsuccessful procedures. Overall, in 75% of the lesions AWE resulted in successful crossing. AWE success rates in easy, intermediate, difficult and very difficult CTOs were 83, 86, 71 and 43%, respectively. 46% could be crossed using a soft guidewire only. An additional success of 34 and 60% could be reached with an intermediate and stiff guidewire, respectively. Adding additional techniques resulted in 88% overall success. Procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses and use of contrast were within highly acceptable ranges (67+/-39min, 27+/-19min, 1.7+/-1.3 Gy, 264+/-123ml). Conclusion(s): The algorithm and new wire technologies led to high success rates. AWE as a standalone procedure is highly successful in J-CTO 0-1. Low- and intermediatevolume CTO operators should try to implement a systematic approach in their CTO procedures, especially for lesions with low J-CTO scores. Adding additional techniques further increases these success rates.© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

873,"Experiences of xerostomia after radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer: A qualitative study AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancer., BACKGROUND: Xerostomia is the most commonly occurring complication during and following radiotherapy. It can persist for several months or years and can have a significant impact on patients' quality of life., DESIGN: This was a qualitative descriptive study., METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 20 participants. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data., RESULTS: Analysis of the manifest content identified five categories: communication problems, physical problems, psychosocial problems, treatment problems and relief strategies. The latent content was formulated into a theme: due to lack of information from professionals, the patients had to find their own solutions for their problems., CONCLUSIONS: Xerostomia is not only a biophysical symptom but also has a profound effect on the emotional, intellectual and sociocultural dimensions of life. The majority of patients continued to suffer from xerostomia and its associated symptoms after radiotherapy, in part, because of a lack of professional support, including the inability of nurses to provide oral health care., RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Nurses need to be knowledgeable about the effects of radiotherapy on oral mucosa and about appropriate interventions. The healthcare system requires a symptom management platform for radiation-induced complications, to help patients, their families and healthcare professionals obtain information about self-care, treatments and relief strategies.

Two patients had radiation related carotid vascular disease, and one patient post lymphangiographic embolism. The literature reporting these uncommon causes of cerebral embolism is reviewed. Post-lymphangiographic embolism carries a uniformly good prognosis. In selected cases of post-irradiation cerebral embolism, surgical intervention may prevent a neurological catastrophe.

3102,"Evaluation of functionally weighted dose-volume parameters for thoracic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) using CT ventilation For the purpose of reducing radiation pneumontisis (RP), four-dimensional CT (4DCT)-based ventilation can be used to reduce functionally weighted lung dose. This study aimed to evaluate the functionally weighted dose-volume parameters and to investigate an optimal weighting method to realize effective planning optimization in thoracic stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Forty patients treated with SABR were analyzed. Ventilation images were obtained from 4DCT using deformable registration and Hounsfield unit-based calculation. Functionally-weighted mean lung dose (fMLD) and functional lung fraction receiving at least x Gy (fVx) were calculated by two weighting methods: thresholding and linear weighting. Various ventilation thresholds (5th-95th, every 5th percentile) were tested. The predictive accuracy for CTCAE grade2 pneumonitis was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic analysis. AUC values varied from 0.459 to 0.570 in accordance with threshold and dose-volume metrics. A combination of 25th percentile threshold and fV30 showed the best result (AUC: 0.570). AUC values with fMLD, fV10, fV20, and fV40 were 0.541, 0.487, 0.548 and 0.563 using a 25th percentile threshold. Although conventional MLD, V10, V20, V30 and V40 showed lower AUC values (0.516, 0.477, 0.534, 0.552 and 0.527), the differences were not statistically significant. fV30 with 25th percentile threshold was the best predictor of RP.

This study assessed the clinical impact of a MDTC on radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment patterns., METHODS: A prospective database (2003-2014) collected patient and tumor characteristics, RAI doses, and tumor recurrences. Patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma >=1 cm were stratified based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification. RAI regimens were compared before initiation of MDTC (2003-2005, n = 88), after establishment of MDTC (2007-2009, n = 95), and after the release of 2009 ATA guidelines (2011-2014, n = 181). RAI doses were defined as low (<=75 mCi), intermediate (76-150 mCi), and high (>150 mCi)., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who received high-dose RAI after implementation of MDTC compared to before initiation of MDTC in the intermediate and high-risk patient groups (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01) without an associated increase in tumor recurrence (11 vs. 7%, p = 0.74). On multivariable analysis, presentation of a patient at MDTC was a negative predictor for receiving high-dose RAI (p = 0.002). As might be expected, there was also a significant decrease in use of RAI after the 2009 ATA guidelines were issued compared to after implementation of MDTC (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with implementation of a thyroid malignancy multidisciplinary conference, we observed significantly decreased postoperative dosing of RAI without increased tumor recurrence. The 2009 ATA guidelines were associated with a further decrease in RAI administration. Treatment for patients with thyroid carcinoma is optimized by a multidisciplinary approach.",Excluded
174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded
177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly. The irradiation history may be germane in the human cases that arise.",Excluded
1257,"Validity of at home model predictions as a proxy for personal exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from mobile phone base stations Background: Epidemiological studies on the potential health effects of RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations require efficient and accurate exposure assessment methods. Previous studies have demonstrated that the 3D geospatial model NISMap is able to rank locations by indoor and outdoor RF-EMF exposure levels. This study extends on previous work by evaluating the suitability of using NISMap to estimate indoor RF-EMF exposure levels at home as a proxy for personal exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations. Method(s): For 93 individuals in the Netherlands we measured personal exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations during a 24h period using an EME-SPY 121 exposimeter. Each individual kept a diary from which we extracted the time spent at home and in the bedroom. We used NISMap to model exposure at the home address of the participant (at bedroom height). We then compared model predictions with measurements for the 24h period, when at home, and in the bedroom by the Spearman correlation coefficient (rsp) and by calculating specificity and sensitivity using the 90th percentile of the exposure distribution as a cutpoint for high exposure. Result(s): We found a low to moderate rsp of 0.36 for the 24h period, 0.51 for measurements at home, and 0.41 for measurements in the bedroom. The specificity was high (0.9) but with a low sensitivity (0.3). Discussion(s): These results indicate that a meaningful ranking of personal RF-EMF can be achieved, even though the correlation between model predictions and 24. h personal RF-EMF measurements is lower than with at home measurements. However, the use of at home RF-EMF field predictions from mobile phone base stations in epidemiological studies leads to significant exposure misclassification that will result in a loss of statistical power to detect health effects.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
132,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for intractable cluster headache: An initial report from the North American Gamma Knife Consortium: Clinical article Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) when used for patients with intractable cluster headache (CH). Methods. Four participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 17 patients who underwent GKS for intractable CH between 1996 and 2008. The median patient age was 47 years (range 26-83 years). The median duration of pain before GKS was 10 years (range 1.3-40 years). Seven patients underwent unsuccessful prior surgical procedures, including microvascular decompression (2 patients), microvascular decompression with glycerol rhizotomy (2 patients), deep brain stimulation (1 patient), trigeminal ganglion stimulation (1 patient), and prior GKS (1 patient). Fourteen patients had associated autonomic symptoms. The radiosurgical target was the trigeminal nerve (TN) root and the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in 8 patients, only the TN in 8 patients, and only the SPG in 1 patient. The median maximum TN and SPG dose was 80 Gy. Results. Favorable pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute Grades I-IIIb) was achieved and maintained in 10 (59%) of 17 patients at a median follow-up of 34 months. Three patients required additional procedures (repeat GKS in 2 patients, hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in 1 patient). Eight (50%) of 16 patients who had their TN irradiated developed facial sensory dysfunction after GKS. Conclusions. Gamma Knife surgery for intractable, medically refractory CH provided lasting pain reduction in approximately 60% of patients, but was associated with a significantly greater chance of facial sensory disturbances than GKS used for trigeminal neuralgia.",Excluded

Multiple sheaths have been created for various takeoffs. The purpose of this article is to show the feasibility of the ""shape-the-sheath"" method in left atrial appendage closure., METHODS: Ten consecutive patients undergoing LAA occlusion without the ""shape-the-sheath"" method were compared to 10 consecutive patients undergoing LAA occlusion with the ""shape-the-sheath"" method using the Amplatzer Cardiac Plug (ACP) system and the Amplatzer TorqVue 45x45 sheath., RESULTS: The ""shape-the-sheath"" method resulted in significant decreases in fluoroscopy time (7.2+/-3.0 min vs. 13.7+/-6.7 min, P<0.05), number of partial recaptures (0% vs. 50%, P<0.05), with a trend toward decrease in the number of complete recaptures (0 vs. 40%, P=0.09) compared to conventional sheath use., CONCLUSIONS: Shaping-the-sheath is a simple, elegant way to help conform delivery systems to better access the LAA and ensure stable position.

1434,"Submillisievert chest dual energy computed tomography: a pilot study OBJECTIVE: To assess if diagnostic dual energy CT (DECT) of the chest can be achieved at submillisievert (sub-mSv) doses., METHODS: Our IRB-approved prospective study included 20 patients who were scanned on dual-source multidector CT(MDCT). All patients gave written informed consent for acquisition of additional image series at reduced radiation dose on a dual-source MDCT (80/140 kV) within 10 s after the standard of care acquisition. Dose reduction was achieved by reducing the quality reference milliampere-second, with combined angular exposure control. Four readers, blinded to all clinical data, evaluated the image sets. Image noise, signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratio were assessed. Volumetric CT dose index (CTDIvol), doselength product (DLP), size specific dose estimate, and effective dose were also recorded., RESULTS: The mean age and body mass index of the patients were 71 years +/- 9 and 24 kg m-2 +/- 3, respectively. Although images became noisier, overall image quality and image sharpness on blended images were considered good or excellent in all cases (20/20). All findings made on the reduced dose images presented with good demarcation. The intraobserver and interobserver agreements were kappa = 0.83 and 0.73, respectively. Mean CTDIvol, size specific dose estimate, DLP and effective dose for reduced dose DECT were: 1.3 +/- 0.2 mGy, 1.8 +/- 0.2 mGy, 51 +/- 9.9 mGy.cm and 0.7 +/- 0.1 mSv, respectively., CONCLUSION: Routine chest DECT can be performed at sub-mSv doses with good image quality and without loss of relevant diagnostic information. Advances in knowledge: (1) Contrast-enhanced DECT of the chest can be performed at sub-mSv doses, down to mean CTDIvol 1.3 mGy and DLP 51 mGy.cm in patients with body mass index <31 kg m-2.

855,"Physicochemical properties of calcific deposits isolated from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves removed from patients following 2-13 years function The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of calcific deposits that cause the failure of tissue-derived heart valve bioprostheses. This was done in an effort to understand the mechanism of pathologic biomineralization in the cardiovascular system and potentially prevent deterioration of bioprostheses. Calcific deposits taken from 10 failed bioprosthetic valves that had been implanted in patients for 2-13 years were characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and solubility measurements. The combined results identified the biomineral as an apatitic calcium phosphate salt with substantial incorporation of sodium, magnesium and carbonate. The average Ca/PO4 ratio for this young"" pathologic biomineral was approximately 1.3, considerably lower than approximately 1.7 found in mature atherosclerotic plaque biomineral and mature skeletal biomineral, both of which approximate hydroxyapatite in composition. Deproteinated calcific deposits from bioprostheses had thermodynamic solubilities comparable to those of both atherosclerotic plaque, typical pathologic biomineral and hydrolyzed octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5 H2O), a proposed precursor phase to biomineral apatite. This later finding, together with chemical composition and structural details of the bioprosthetic deposits themselves, supports a mechanism of cardiovascular calcification in which OCP plays a crucial role in the formation of the final apatitic phase. This suggests an approach toward prevention of bioprosthetic tissue calcification through control of the formation of the kinetically favored OCP precursor and/or its transformation into bioapatite.""",Excluded
774,"Epidemiology and environmental risk in hairy cell leukemia Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an orphan subtype of leukaemia which constitutes less than 2% of all leukaemia's, with an incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 persons per annum. Median age at presentation is 55 years and it is 3-4 times more frequent in males. It is also more frequently encountered in whites and less in Asians, Africans and Arabs. The epidemiologic data are multi-factorial and influenced by ethnicity and geographical factors. Other reported associations relate to some environmental exposures and possible occupational factors. Smoking appears to have an inverse correlation with the development of hairy cell leukaemia, while farming and exposure to pesticides, petroleum products, diesel and ionizing radiation have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk. National and international collaborative efforts are needed in order to undertake more extensive studies involving larger patient cohorts, aiming to determine the role of occupational and environmental risk factors in the development of this rare form of chronic leukaemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

2589,"Evaluation of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D PET scanner in H2(15)O brain activation studies: dose fractionation strategies for rCBF and signal enhancing protocols We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
1065,"Prediction of LIVER Toxicity with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy: A Dosimetric Analysis Purpose/Objective(s): To further evaluate the corresponding dosimetric factors with the liver toxicity following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Materials/Methods: Between 2015-2018, 76 patients with liver tumor (primary or metastases) treated with SBRT were reviewed based on dosimetric factors and liver function tests. The reference point was contoured that the main portal ven divided in the liver hilum into the left portal vein branch and the right portal vein branch on the contrast enhanced simulation CT scan set. Two different isotropic expansions from the reference point were generated as 2(zone 1) and 4 cm(zon 2). Out of zone 2 was defined as zone 3 in the rest of liver. The radiation doses of each zones were converted BED 10 and tested for correlation with liver functon tests which were obtained during follow up. Liver functions were assessed with Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) grading system for liver disease severity. Result(s): Median follow up was 10 months (range 6-36 months). Four of 76 patients were diagnosed with primary liver tumor(Hepatocellulary ca), rest of 72 patients were diagnosed secondary tumor(kolorectal 30, lung 21, breast 13, other 8). Median age was 64(range 48-76). Sixteen of patients have grade 1 liver disfunction, 4 of patients have grade 2 toxicity after radiotherapy. The prescription doses were 45-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Median tumor volume was 24.4 cc(range 8.5-39.9 cc). The volume of received 20 Gy (VBED1020) more than 50 cc in the zone 2, was significantly correlated with grade 1 toxicity(p=0.03). Conclusion(s): These results suggest that the volume of received 20 Gy more than 50 cc dose to 2 cm expansion from reference point in the liver may be associated with acute liver enzyme abnormality. This dosimetric parameter has potential implications for future liver SBRT studies.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
1621,"Intravascular radiation accelerates atherosclerotic lesion formation of hypercholesteremic rabbits OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effect of intravascular radiation (IR) on the arterial wall of uninjured vessels in the hypercholesteremic rabbit model., METHODS: Aortas of 24 New Zealand white rabbits were treated with either intravascular 192-Ir gamma-radiation (15 Gy at 2 mm from the center of the source) or were exposed to the source catheter without radiation (sham controls). Following the radiation treatment, the animals were fed a 2% cholesterol diet until euthanasia at 2 (n=8) or 6 (n=16) weeks. Arteries were analyzed using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM); transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) 1, a promoter of connective tissue deposition, was also monitored., RESULTS: At 2 weeks, SEM analysis showed well-aligned endothelial cells in nonradiated segments, whereas irradiated arteries consistently contained adherent and subendothelial macrophages with focal areas of endothelial disruption. Further radiated segments at 2 weeks showed a 7-fold increase in active TGF beta-1 over nonradiated segments. At 6 weeks, there was a significant increase in plaque and vessel wall area relative to control arteries, however, no differences were noted in the density of actin-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or macrophages. Similarly, no differences were noted in cell proliferation between groups as evidenced by the marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). In contrast, nonirradiated segments frequently contained cellular areas with extracellular lipid., CONCLUSION: Exposure of previously uninjured vessels to IR and hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plaque burden and leads to more advanced plaque types. Special care should be taken to minimize radiation exposure in normal vascular segments in hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing radiation therapy.",Included
710,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1 +/- 150.5 mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2 +/- 204.6 mSv and 150.5 +/- 211.2 mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133 , rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs.

GERD patients were divided into as reflux esophagitis, acid-nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and weakly acid-NERD groups. Patients with normal esophageal mucosa, normal acid exposure and negative proton pump inhibitor test were enrolled in FH group. EGJ-CI (mmHg.cm) as well as EGJ rest pressure and 4s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4s) were measured., RESULTS: Among the 115 patients, 18 were reflux esophagitis [(49.0+/-18.9) years, M:F=10:8], 25 were acid-NERD [(48.7+/-14.4) years, M:F=13:12], 37 were weakly acid-NERD [(52.0+/-14.8) years, M:F=15:22] and 35 were FH [(53.6+/-14.8), M:F=8:27]. No differences of Gerd-Q scores were noticed between the four groups. (1)Negative correlations were demonstrated between EGJ-CI and esophageal acid exposure time (r=-0.283, P=0.002), EGJ-CI and acid reflux events (r=-0.233, P=0.012), EGJ-CI and weakly acid reflux events (r=-0.213, P=0.022), EGJ-CI and non-acid reflux events (r=-0.200, P=0.032). (2)The value of EGJ-CI was significantly higher in FH patients than in the three subgroups of GERD(all P<0.01). EGJ rest pressure of FH group was higher than that of acid-NERD (P<0.01). IRP 4s in acid-NERD group was lower than that of FH and weakly acid-NERD (P<0.05). (3)The area under curve (AUC) of EGJ-CI was higher than that of EGJ-CIT, EGJ rest pressure or IRP 4s(0.686 vs 0.678, 0.641 and 0.578).

3177,"Complete histopathological regression in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgical treatment Background/Aim. Multimodal approach to locally advanced rectal cancer treatment results in better disease outcome. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improves disease local control, reduces risk of local recurrence and in the majority of patients with complete or substantial regression of the tumors significantly improves survival rates. According to the literature data, approximately 20% of patients had achieved complete histopathological response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall survival in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgery. Methods. This retrospective study included 191 patients. Patients received preoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy-chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by operation that favorized sphincter preservation with total mesorectal excision (TME) from June 2000 until December 2010. Diagnosis was established according to the following algorithm: patient history, digital rectal examiantion, colonoscopy with biopsy and histopathology verification, and preoperative clinical staging. Patients with tumors located below promontorium were included in the study and patients with metastatic disease and local recurrence were excluded from the study. For tumors located below the promontorium preoperative radiotherapy was used with total dose of 50.4 Gy, divided into daily doses of 1.8 Gy, during 28 days. Chemotherapy followed radiotherapy with 5- fluorouracil and folic acid (Leucovorin) on days 1, 2, 10, 11, 20 and 21. Six to ten weeks after neoadjuvant therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to restage tumors and operation were performed. Results. Of all patients that received preopertive chemoradiation, 163 had radical sphincter preservig surgery and 28 patients had paliative operations. Histopathological examination of the specimens showed that the complete histopathological regression was achieved in 21.4% of the patients, downstaged was found in 63.2% of them and unchanged stage was found in 15.3% of the patients. The five-year survival rate was 63.3% and 50.5 % in the patients with pCR and patients with incomplete histopathological regression, respectively. Survival rates between two groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion. The preoperative chemoradiotherapy is very important in achieving optimal clinical care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Copyright © 2018, Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

1719,"Combining paratransgenesis with SIT: impact of ionizing radiation on the DNA copy number of Sodalis glossinidius in tsetse flies BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae) are the cyclical vectors of the causative agents of African Trypanosomosis, which has been identified as a neglected tropical disease in both humans and animals in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has shown to be a powerful method to manage tsetse fly populations when used in the frame of an area-wide integrated pest management (AW-IPM) program. To date, the release of sterile males to manage tsetse fly populations has only been implemented in areas to reduce transmission of animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). The implementation of the SIT in areas with Human African Trypanosomosis (HAT) would require additional measures to eliminate the potential risk associated with the release of sterile males that require blood meals to survive and hence, might contribute to disease transmission. Paratransgenesis offers the potential to develop tsetse flies that are refractory to trypanosome infection by modifying their associated bacteria (Sodalis glossinidius) here after referred to as Sodalis. Here we assessed the feasibility of combining the paratransgenesis approach with SIT by analyzing the impact of ionizing radiation on the copy number of Sodalis and the vectorial capacity of sterilized tsetse males., RESULTS: Adult Glossina morsitans morsitans that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 22 post larviposition did not show a significant decline in Sodalis copy number as compared with non-irradiated flies. Conversely, the Sodalis copy number was significantly reduced in adults that emerged from puparia irradiated on day 29 post larviposition and in adults irradiated on day 7 post emergence. Moreover, irradiating 22-day old puparia reduced the copy number of Wolbachia and Wigglesworthia in emerged adults as compared with non-irradiated controls, but the radiation treatment had no significant impact on the vectorial competence of the flies., CONCLUSION: Although the radiation treatment significantly reduced the copy number of some tsetse fly symbionts, the copy number of Sodalis recovered with time in flies irradiated as 22-day old puparia. This recovery offers the opportunity to combine a paratransgenesis approach - using modified Sodalis to produce males refractory to trypanosome infection - with the release of sterile males to minimize the risk of disease transmission, especially in HAT endemic areas. Moreover, irradiation did not increase the vector competence of the flies for trypanosomes.",Excluded

Method(s): Clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of MCC and with an indication to undergo RT at the European Institute of Oncology between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field. At the time of data collection, 16 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 patient was alive with advanced status of disease, 8 patients died of disease progression, and 1 patient died of other causes. Conclusion(s): The management of unknown primary and polyomavirus-positive cases, which had a better prognosis in our series, may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, given the limited data available regarding optimal treatment.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.",Excluded
821,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included
2157,"Biologic dosimetry in thyroid cancer patients after repeated treatments with iodine-131 UNLABELLED: To estimate a cumulative dosimetric index that reflects the dose to the circulating lymphocytes after repeated treatments with 131I, biologic dosimetry was applied to 18 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and neck relapse or lung metastases., METHODS: Chromosomal aberrations were scored in peripheral blood samples that were obtained before and 4 days after each administration of 3.7 GBq 131I according to two methods, conventional cytogenetics and chromosome 4 painting., RESULTS: The mean dosimetric index was equal to 0.5 Gy by both methods after the administration of 3.7 GBq 131I. Repeated administrations of 131I delivered the same dose each time, resulting in a cumulative dose from 1-3.5 Gy in the patients who had two to seven treatments. However, the estimated dose, based on the number of chromosomal aberrations on Day 4 and, above all, from the third treatment on, was considerably lower than the real dose absorbed by the lymphocytes. This may be linked to the phenomenon of apoptosis, which results in a loss of information during the course of repeated irradiation., CONCLUSION: Both chromosomal painting and conventional cytogenetics underestimate the cumulative dose after repeated 131I treatments. A complementary test measuring apoptosis may improve the dose estimates.",Excluded
459,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded
590,"Upregulation of VEGF and FGF2 in normal rat brain after experimental intraoperative radiation therapy The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)2 in the irradiated brain was examined to test how a single high dose radiation, similar to that used for intraoperative radiation therapy given to the normal cerebrum, can affect the vascular endothelium. After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included
1704,"Evaluation and definitive management of medically inoperable early stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Part 2: newer treatment modalities Lung cancer is estimated to be the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in 2006, and the leading causes of cancer mortality. Non-small-cell lung cancer represents the majority of such cases. Most of these patients have locally advanced disease at presentation and are not eligible for curative resection. For the minority of patients who are technically resectable at presentation, lobectomy or pneumonectomy and pathologic mediastinal nodal staging offer the best overall survival. The high rate of comorbid medical illness and poor baseline pulmonary function in this population, however, make many such early-stage patients medically inoperable. For these patients, conventional single-modality radiotherapy has been the primary definitive treatment option, as discussed in part 1 of this article, which appeared in last month's issue. Numerous retrospective reports demonstrate long-term disease-free and overall survival data that are modestly superior to that expected after observation, but both local and distant failure continue to be significant risks. Investigation of radiotherapy dose escalation is ongoing, in an effort to improve local control while maintaining minimal toxicity. Additionally, emerging evidence suggests that new modalities, such as stereotactic radiosurgery and radiofrequency ablation, may also be potentially curative treatment alternatives. These modalities are addressed in part 2.",Excluded
3369,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may increase the risk of severe anastomotic complications after esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) improves long-term survival for patients with esophageal cancer. On the other hand, there are indications that nCRT may increase the risk for postoperative morbidity. The aims of this study were to estimate the radiation exposure to the site of anastomosis on the gastric fundus and to assess whether nCRT affected the incidence or severity of cervical anastomotic complications., METHODS: A retrospective cohort of patients with cancer of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction, who were reconstructed with cervical anastomosis. The planned radiation dose to the site of the cervical anastomosis on the gastric fundus was estimated for each patient., RESULTS: The analysis of the dose plans showed that 20 out of 22 (93 %) available patients received radiotherapy toward the planned site of the anastomosis in the region of the gastric fundus with doses ranging from 6 to 40 Gy. In the nCRT group, 12 out of 28 patients (43 %) had anastomotic complications compared to 16 out of 42 (38 %) in the non-RT group (p = 0.69). In the nCRT group, 39 % had anastomotic complications that led to a Clavien-Dindo grade of IVa or higher compared to 17 % in the non-RT group (p = 0.03). The OR for Clavien-Dindo grade IVa or worse was 6.0 (95 % CI 1.52-23.50)., CONCLUSION: This small retrospective study suggests that nCRT exposes the future anastomotic site to doses of radiation that may impair healing of the subsequent cervical anastomosis. Our data further suggest that nCRT may increase the severity of cervical anastomotic complications, and this hypothesis needs to be tested in a large prospective study.",Excluded
768,"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction: Cumulative effect of cost, radiation, and turnaround time on the patient and the health care system OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reiterate the predominance of CT in evaluating ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in terms of cost-effectiveness, reduction of radiation exposure, and turnaround time as the measurement parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older with a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of shunt malfunction and underwent shunt series radiography and head CT within 12 hours. Shunt revision occurring contemporaneously with imaging was defined as revision within 48 hours of the original imaging report. The effective radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product from the scanner with the standard conversion coefficient k (k = 0.0021 mSv/mGy x cm). The turnaround time for patients who underwent both head CT and shunt series radiography was calculated from time of the first study to the time of completion of the last study. RESULTS. There were 16 shunt revisions in 239 patients. The sensitivity of CT was 87.5%; specificity, 91.4%; positive predictive value, 42.4%; and negative predictive value, 99%. The sensitivity of shunt series radiography was 18.7%; specificity, 90.9%; positive predictive value, 13%; and negative predictive value, 93.9%. There were 223 observations of CT radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.87 +/- 0.45). There also were 223 observations of shunt radiography radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.57 +/- 0.60). The median turnaround time among patients undergoing CT and shunt radiography was 109 +/- 84 minutes. CONCLUSION. Shunt series radiography is a low-yield diagnostic imaging modality for identifying shunt malfunction and prolongs turnaround time, increases medical cost, and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

2682,"Physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses to shaded or unshaded pens in a hot, sunny environment Housing recommendations for horses invariably include providing access to shade on hot, sunny days, but the potential benefits have not been scientifically studied. This experiment measured physiological, behavioral, and serological responses of horses confined individually to completely shaded (SH) or completely unshaded (SUN) drylot pens during the summer in Davis, CA. Twelve healthy adult horses in a crossover design experienced both treatments for 5 d each. Rectal temperature, respiration rate, skin temperature, and sweat scores were recorded hourly from 1230 to 1730 h daily. Observations were recorded from 1200 to 1800 h for proximity to water, foraging, locomotion, and insect avoidance behaviors. Daily blood samples were obtained to measure cortisol, hematocrit, and neutrophil- to-lymphocyte ratio. Automated and handheld sensors were used to record environmental conditions. The mean ambient temperature from 1200 to 1800 h during the study was 30.6degreeC. Rectal temperature was greater for horses in SUN than for SH (mean 37.8degreeC and 37.5degreeC, respectively, SE = 0.06, P = 0.002) as was respiration rate (25.5 and 20.5 breaths/min, SE = 1.3, P = 0.008), and skin temperature (35.6degreeC and 34.6degreeC, SE = 0.1, P < 0.001). Horses in SUN showed sweat in 51.4% of observations vs. 1.1% for horses in SH. Horses in SUN spent more time than SH horses standing near their water source (34.0% of observations vs. 20.2%, SE = 0.3, P = 0.004). No differences were observed for foraging, locomotion, or insect avoidance behavior (P > 0.05). Cortisol concentrations were greater in SUN than SH (3.4 and 2.6 mug/dL, respectively, P < 0.001) but remained within the normal range for resting horses. No treatment differences were observed for hematocrit or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (P > 0.05). Horses exhibited treatment differences in the physiological measures first, most notably in rectal temperature at 1230 h, corresponding to peak solar radiation. Behavioral responses followed these physiological changes, with treatment differences in time standing near water becoming apparent at 1400 h as ambient and black globe temperature increased. Our results indicate that both the SH and SUN treatment groups exhibited thermoregulatory responses to these summer conditions and horses benefited from shade, as it mitigated these physiological and behavioral changes. These results are applicable in developing best management practices for the care of domestic horses. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.",Excluded
184,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200. Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Included

3441,"Absence of radiographic progression of hip arthritis during infliximab treatment for ankylosing spondylitis This study aims to examine the impact of long-term treatment with the anti-TNF antibody infliximab on radiographic progression of hip arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis. Anteroposterior X-rays of the pelvis obtained at baseline from consecutive patients with ankylosing spondylitis and bilateral hip arthritis were compared with X-rays obtained after 6 +/- 2.5 years (mean +/- SD) of continuous infliximab treatment. Analysis was performed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Hip Index (BASRI-h) scoring system (min 0, max 4). Hip joint space width was also assessed by the average of measurements at three distinct sites between the acetabulum and femoral head. In 23 patients with active disease (21 men, mean age and disease duration of 45 and 16 years, respectively), the BASRI-h score at baseline was 1 in 7, 2 in 16, 3 in 16, and 4 in 7 hips (including two arthroplasties). Individual BASRI-h scores at baseline (2.50 +/- 0.86, mean +/- SD) remained unchanged in all patients at end of follow-up. At baseline, the average width of the whole joint space (3.56 +/- 0.70 mm, n = 44) was not associated with disease activity measurements but negatively correlated with BAS functional index (Spearman r = -0.5, P = 0.007). After 2-10 years of infliximab treatment, the average width of the whole joint space in these patients (3.59 +/- 0.79 mm) was not reduced.

999,"Oblique corpectomy for treatment of cervical spine epidural abscesses: Report on four cases Background Spinal epidural abscesses (SEAs) in cervical locations are particularly life-threatening. Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded

At presentation, males reported severe erectile dysfunction that was significantly associated with age. However, only in sexual desire was the difference between baseline and phase 3 significant. In females, an improvement was observed in all parameters of FSFI between phase 1 and 3. Females with stage III disease achieved lower scores in almost all parameters of FSFI than those with stage II. Finally, although a quarter of patients reported elevated depression scores, depression was not related to sexual function., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of cancer patients experience intense levels of sexual dysfunction and depression throughout radiotherapy and the subsequent year.

981,"Reducing radiation exposure during invasive coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions implementing a simple four-step protocol Background: With an increasing number of complex and repeated percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), radiation-induced hazards for patients and operators remain an important issue in fluoroscopy-guided procedures. Our objective was to evaluate radiation exposure during coronary angiographic procedures and assess the efficacy of a four-step program to reduce radiation exposure during coronary angiography (CAG) and PCI. Methods and Results: A retrospective single-center analysis was performed in patients undergoing CAG or PCI in the first 6 months of 2012 vs. the first 6 months of 2014 (n = 3,107 procedures). During 2013, a four-step protocol was established in our hospital. It contained measures to reduce radiation exposure, including a frame rate reduction from 15 to 7.5 frames per second, the use of fluoroscopy storage, strict use of beam collimation, and repeat training on radiation safety. After adjustment for confounding variables, a dose-area product (DAP) reduction of 54.2 % was observed subsequent to implementation of the four-step protocol. Independent predictors of DAP were age [odds ratio (OR) 1.01], body surface area (OR 5.47), prior coronary artery bypass grafting (OR 1.44), radial access (OR 1.16), PCI (OR 2.36), female gender (OR 0.91), and the implementation of the four-step program (OR 0.46). Conclusion(s): A simple four-step protocol led to a significant reduction in radiation exposure in diagnostic and interventional coronary procedures without significant drawbacks in image quality. Hence, radiation safety programs are of paramount importance and should be established to improve patient and operator safety with regard to radiation-induced hazards.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Objective(s): To assess internal jugular vein (IJV) flow and morphology during spaceflight and to investigate if lower body negative pressure is associated with reversing the headward fluid shift experienced during spaceflight. Design, Setting, and Participant(s): This prospective cohort study included 11 International Space Station crew members participating in long-duration spaceflight missions. Internal jugular vein measurements from before launch and approximately 40 days after landing were acquired in 3 positions: seated, supine, and 15degree head-down tilt. In-flight IJV measurements were acquired at approximately 50 days and 150 days into spaceflight during normal spaceflight conditions as well as during use of lower body negative pressure. Data were analyzed in June 2019. Exposures: Posture changes on Earth, spaceflight, and lower body negative pressure. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ultrasonographic assessments of IJV cross-sectional area, pressure, blood flow, and thrombus formation. Result(s): The 11 healthy crew members included in the study (mean [SD] age, 46.9 [6.3] years, 9 [82%] men) spent a mean (SD) of 210 (76) days in space. Mean IJV area increased from 9.8 (95% CI,-1.2 to 20.7) mm2 in the preflight seated position to 70.3 (95% CI, 59.3-81.2) mm2 during spaceflight (P <.001). Mean IJV pressure increased from the preflight seated position measurement of 5.1 (95% CI, 2.5-7.8) mm Hg to 21.1 (95% CI, 18.5-23.7) mm Hg during spaceflight (P <.001). Furthermore, stagnant or reverse flow in the IJV was observed in 6 crew members (55%) on approximate flight day 50. Notably, 1 crew member was found to have an occlusive IJV thrombus, and a potential partial IJV thrombus was identified in another crew member retrospectively. Lower body negative pressure was associated with improved blood flow in 10 of 17 sessions (59%) during spaceflight. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found stagnant and retrograde blood flow associated with spaceflight in the IJVs of astronauts and IJV thrombosis in at least 1 astronaut, a newly discovered risk associated with spaceflight. Lower body negative pressure may be a promising countermeasure to enhance venous blood flow in the upper body during spaceflight.Copyright © 2019 JAMA Network Open.",Excluded
330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded
1137,"Balloon-sacroplasty on patients with osteoporotic fatigue fractures Introduction In patients with calcipenic osteopathy, fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum are relatively common and are typically accompanied by strong, disabling pain. The aim of our study was to verify the feasibility and safety of Sacroplasty by using a balloon catheter as well as the outcome of pain after the intervention. Material(s) and Method(s): 25 patients (20 women with an average age of 72.6 years, 5 men with an average age of 68.4 years) were diagnosed in a CT to have an Os sacrum fracture, in 12 women the fracture was unilateral, in the remaining patients bilateral. As a manifestation from an extant bone reconstruction process, all patients, through MRT strong T2 weighted images, were found to have distinctive oedema. In QCT results, all patients were found to have strong demineralisation of the vertebrae column with results from max 63mg/dl to min 13mg/dl, clinically, extreme pain is significant. On all patients, a CT controlled balloon sacroplasty was performed. During the intervention, the patient is in a ventral position, to enable the cement to be dispensed in a longitudinal angle to the fracture, and the balloon catheter is directed through a hollow needle in the Os sacrum either from the caudal to the cranial or from the craniodorsal to the caudoventral. The balloon catheter was accordingly de/inflated 1-3 times along the fracture in the appropriate direction, thus causing a cavity that was then filled with PMMA-cement under low pressure. A control-CT as well as a conventional X-ray was then carried out. The pain intensity was defined by means of VAS before the intervention, on the second day, after 6 and 12 months. Result(s): The balloon-sacroplasty enabled a good technical performance on every patient. The control-CT and the X-Ray control of the Os sacrum showed an adequate distribution of the cement, a cement leakage was not detected. Before the operation, the average pain encountered was according to the VAS 8.3. On the second postoperative day, a considerable reduction with an average of 2.7 was reported, this was still stable with an average of 2.5 after 6 and 12 months. Discussion(s): The Balloon-Sacroplasty is an effective treatment method for immediate pain relief and remobilisation in patients with fatigue fractures of the Os sacrum. Different approches as well as the utilisation of a balloon enables preferably large cement streams in the longitudinal direction of the fracture in the Os sacrums.",Excluded

Method(s): The patients who had undergone SWL for a single opaque renal stone < 2 cm in diameter and proximal ureteric stone < 1 cm in diameter were collected retrospectively. The characteristics of patients and stones were recorded. The stone attitude, HU, abdominal fat parameters, para-perirenal fat area, perirenal infiltration and severity of hydronephrosis with pre-treatment NonContrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and stone density with radiography were evaluated by a radiologist. Four weeks after the last SWL; all patients were evaluated by plain X-ray and categorized as Stone Free (SF) and Residual Fragment (RF) group. Result(s): 51 patients with renal stones and 88 patients with proximal ureteral stones were included in the study. 24 (47%) and 63 (71%) patients were classified as SFfor renal and ureteral stones respectively. Only stone size was an independent predictor for stone-free rates after SWL for renal and proximal ureteral stones on multivariate analysis. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for renal calculi revealed that creatinine level, stone size, stone attitude, Houns-Field Unit (HU) and Skin-to-Stone Distance (SSD) were the predictive factors for the SWL outcome (p< 0.05). The ROC curve for ureteral calculi demonstrated that HU, stone size and attitude were the predictive factors (p< 0.05).

3,"New radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC-SC) for chemo-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis Purpose/Objective: Linear accelerator-based radiotherapy has little effect on most of locally-advanced neoplasmas that have grown to several centimeters or more. Such tumors contain numerous hypoxic cancer cells and/or large amounts of anti-oxidative enzymes, and are therefore resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays and electrons from linear accelerators (Linac). We have developed a new radiosensitizer containing hydrogen peroxide & sodium hyaluronate for topical tumor injection for various types of tumors which are not superficially exposed, and the method was named 'KORTUC II'. Safety and effectiveness of the method have already been successfully performed by our clinical trials for patients with unresectable and/or recurrent neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of KORTUC II specifically for patients with chemotherapy-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis, and the method was named as KORTUC-SC (KORTUC for supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis). For these lesions, curative resection is impossible because of the direct invasion of neoplasms to surrounding cervical great vessels. Therefore new strategies for better local control have been needed. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was performed at Kochi Medical School Hospital between September 2006 and March 2010. Twelve patients (2 men,10 women) with chemotherapy-resistant supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were enrolled into the study after providing fully informed written consent. All the patients underwent PET-CT examinations prior to and at 3 ~ 6 months after KORTUC-SC. We compared these two examination results. Patients were 58 to 77 years old (average age was 65).The radiotherapy regimen was 4 Gy/time, 3 times/week, for 4 weeks, and total dose was 48 Gy. The appropriate energy level of electron beams was selected for individual patients in terms of depth of the target lesion. The injection of 3 to 6 ml of the agent was started from the 5th session of radiotherapy, and was performed twice a week under ultrasonographic guidance. Result(s): The numbers of the patients were 12. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by the FDG-PET performed prior to and following the KORTUC-SC treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) showed complete response (CR), 1 (8.3%) showed partial response (PR), 3 (25%) showed stable disease(SD), and another 2 (16.6%) showed progressive disease (PD). Overall survival rate was 83% at 1 year (10/12 patients) and 75% at 2 years (9/12 patients). The mean duration of follow-up at the end of February 2011 was 35.1 months. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of FDG-PET study, remarkable therapeutic effects of the KORTUC II treatment for chemotherapyresistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis (KORTUC-SC) were clearly identified. The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local pain at the injection site. The treatment outcomes were satisfactory and the adverse events were within the permissible range. This therapy is much less expensive than molecular-targeted therapies in current use, such as Cetuximab. Some well designed prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of KORTUC-SC.",Excluded
1482,"Upfront gefitinib/erlotinib treatment followed by concomitant radiotherapy for advanced lung cancer: A mono-institutional experience Background: Upfront tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has proved effective for selective advanced lung cancer patients in Taiwan. We hypothesized that early integration of radiotherapy during TKI treatment would decrease the chance of drug resistance and prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Method(s): This study included 25 patients with stage IIIb or IV non-squamous cell, non-small cell lung cancer (NSqCLC) who responded to upfront TKI treatment. Multi-target radiotherapy was administered during the TKI treatment course. Tomotherapy comprising a hypofractionated schedule with a dose of 40-50. Gy in 16-20 fractions was used for individual metastatic lesions. Result(s): The patients' median follow-up duration was 30 months (range, 9-62 months). Of the 23 patients who had stage IV disease, 9 had oligometastases (<=5 gross target volumes) and 14 were in the more advanced stages of the disease. Twelve patients received more than 1 cycle of radiotherapy (median, 3; range, 2-6) with TKI being the only systemic treatment before they were salvaged with chemotherapy. The overall response rate after radiotherapy was 84.0%, and the median PFS was 16 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 62.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.1-85.8%). Toxicities were generally tolerated but it is necessary to prevent radiation-induced pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): We showed that combined first-line TKI therapy and early multi-target radiotherapy are very effective in selected patients that respond to TKI, when the status of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are not known before the treatment. Our data may aid expansion of the effectiveness of TKI treatment through radiotherapy in Asian patients with stage IV NSqCLC. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded

The study of prevalence of risk factors for CVDs development in men occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation revealed frequent changes in the type of work performed, higher levels of psychoemotional tension, as well as high prevalence of low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol) and obesity. Women workers of the main production were found to have hypercholesterolaemia more often than those of the auxiliary production. Annual health checks of nuclear workers should be extended to include waist and hips measurement, body mass index (BMI) calculation, lipid factors evaluation, as well as stress tests (bicycle and/or stress echocardiography) in case there are three or more risk factors for CVDs for workers of the main production.""",Included
597,"Association between radiation dose and pathological complete response after preoperative radiochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer Aim: This study was undertaken to examine the impact of radiation dose on pathological complete response (pCR) rates following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (N-RCT) for squamous cell esophageal cancer (ESCC). Patients and Methods: From 1988 to 2011, 218 patients were treated with 30-30.6 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction), 39.6-40 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) or 44-45 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) and concomitant cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin + 5-FU or 5-FU alone. The most commonly used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-FU-Alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day during the whole course of treatment (n=111). To eliminate the dispersing effect of potentially different efficacy levels of these drug regimens on pCR, we excluded patients with regimens other than 5-FU-Alone. Result(s): Histomorphological regression grade 1a (0% residual tumor), 1b (<10% residual tumor), 2 (10-50% residual tumor) and 3 (>50% residual tumor) was observed in 26 (23%), 24 (22%), 36 (32%) and 25 (23%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 9 out of 71 (13%) patients treated with 30 Gy-30.6 Gy, 13 of 34 (38%) patients treated with 39.6-40 Gy and 4 of 6 (67%) patients treated with 44-45 Gy (p=0.001). Median follow-up time from the start of N-RCT was 191 months (range=2-262 months). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 33% for the whole cohort. OS at 5 years was 58% for patients with pCR compared to 25% for patients with less favorable response to N-RCT (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion(s): The dose of radiation correlates significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR in stage II/III squamous cell esophageal cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are required to definitively evaluate the impact of application of higher radiation doses on efficacy and safety/tolerability in the context of N-RCT on the clinical outcomes.",Excluded
135,"Simulator training reduces radiation exposure and improves trainees' performance in placing electrophysiologic catheters during patient-based procedures Background: Currently, training in interventional electrophysiology is based on conventional methodologies, and a paucity of data on the usefulness of simulation in this field is available. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulator training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Method(s): Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7.0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1.5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1-3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Result(s): Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1.71 +/- 1.24 to 0.42 +/- 0.68 (P <.001), from 121 +/- 88 seconds to 76 +/- 54 seconds (P <.001), and from 175 +/- 138 seconds to 102 +/- 74 seconds (P <.001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 +/- 220 seconds to 305 +/- 111 seconds (P <.0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures. Conclusion(s): During the early phase of the trainees' learning curve, simulator training significantly improves the independent trainees' performance with reduction in radiation exposure. © 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

411,"Parkinson's disease: a test of the multifactorial etiologic hypothesis We studied the relative etiologic importance upon the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) of occupational exposure to herbicides and other compounds, ionizing radiation exposure, family history of PD and essential tremor, smoking, and history of various viral and other medical conditions. We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology for PD, probably involving genetic, environmental, trauma, and possibly other factors.",Excluded
2379,"Brachytherapy in lip carcinoma: Long-term results Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for local control and relapse-free survival in squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the lips. We compared two groups: one with tumors on the skin and the other with tumors on the lip. Patients and Methods: All patients had been treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Centre from 1990 to 2008 for squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was performed with iridium 192 wires according to the Paris system rules. On average, the dose delivered was 65 Gy. Result(s): 172 consecutive patients were included in our study; 69 had skin carcinoma (squamous cell or basal cell), and 92 had squamous cell mucosal carcinoma. The average follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the skin cancer group, there were five local recurrences and one lymph node recurrence. In the mucosal cancer group, there were ten local recurrences and five lymph node recurrences. The 8-year relapse-free survival for the entire population was 80%. The 8-year relapse-free survival was 85% for skin carcinoma 75% for mucosal carcinoma, with no significant difference between groups. The functional results were satisfactory for 99% of patients, and the cosmetic results were satisfactory for 92%. Maximal toxicity observed was Grade 2. Conclusion(s): Low-dose-rate brachytherapy can be used to treat lip carcinomas at Stages T1 and T2 as the only treatment with excellent results for local control and relapse-free survival. The benefits of brachytherapy are also cosmetic and functional, with 91% of patients having no side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
198,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included
300,"Estimation of radiation exposure of retrospective gated and prospective triggered 128-slice triple-rule-out CT angiography CT has become an important role in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain to exclude an aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism and acute coronary artery syndrome. However, the additional radiation exposure is a cause of concern and dose saving strategies should be applied, if possible. To estimate effective dose of retrospective gated and prospective ECG-triggered triple-rule-out computed tomography angiography (TRO-CTA). An Alderson-Rando-phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used for dose measurements. Exposure was performed on a 128-slice single source scanner. The following scan parameters were used (retrospective ECG-gated): 120 kV, 190 mAs/rot., collimation 128x0.6 mm, rotation time 0.3 s. Protocols with a simulated heart rate (HR) of 60 and 100 bpm were performed using the standard ECG-pulsing as well as MinDose. Additionally, a prospective triggered TRO-CTA was acquired (HR 60 bpm). The estimated effective dose of retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA ranged from 7.4-13.4 mSv and from 10.1-17.5 mSv for men and women, respectively. Due to radiosensitive breast tissue, women received a significant increased effective dose of up to 64.7% +/- 0.03% (p = 0.028) compared to men. MinDose reduces radiation exposure of up to 33.0% +/- 6.5% in comparison to standard ECG-pulsing (p < 0.001). The effective dose increased significantly with lower heart rates (p < 0.001). Prospective ECG-triggered TRO-CTA showed an effective dose of 5.9 mSv and 8.2 mSv for men and women, respectively. Compared to retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA a significant dose reduction was observed (p < 0.001). Due to the significant different dose exposure, scan protocols should be specifically adapted in a patient- and problem-oriented manner.",Excluded
3450,"A deep learning tool for fully automated measurements of sagittal spinopelvic balance from X-ray images: performance evaluation Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a novel deep learning (DL) tool for fully automated measurements of the sagittal spinopelvic balance from X-ray images of the spine in comparison with manual measurements. Method(s): Ninety-seven conventional upright sagittal X-ray images from 55 subjects were retrospectively included in this study. Measurements of the parameters of the sagittal spinopelvic balance, i.e., the sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), spinal tilt (ST), pelvic incidence (PI) and spinosacral angle (SSA), were obtained manually by identifying specific anatomical landmarks using the SurgiMap Spine software and by the fully automated DL tool. Statistical analysis was performed in terms of the mean absolute difference (MAD), standard deviation (SD) and Pearson correlation, while the paired t test was used to search for statistically significant differences between manual and automated measurements. Result(s): The differences between reference manual measurements and those obtained automatically by the DL tool were, respectively, for SS, PT, ST, PI and SSA, equal to 5.0degree (3.4degree), 2.7degree (2.5degree), 1.2degree (1.2degree), 5.5degree (4.2degree) and 5.0degree (3.5degree) in terms of MAD (SD), with a statistically significant corresponding Pearson correlation of 0.73, 0.90, 0.95, 0.81 and 0.71. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two types of measurement (p value always above 0.05). Conclusion(s): The differences between measurements are in the range of the observer variability of manual measurements, indicating that the DL tool can provide clinically equivalent measurements in terms of accuracy but superior measurements in terms of cost-effectiveness, reliability and reproducibility.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
522,"Correlation between fracture healing status and euroqol score (EQ-5D) during conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health related quality of life outcome. There are few reports investigating the relationship between fracture healing status and EQ-5D after conservative treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHOD(S): Forty consecutive patients (5 male, 35 female, average age: 78) had fresh VCFs due to primary osteoporosis diagnosed by MRI. They were treated in hospital for 2 to 3 weeks by conservative therapy consisting of medication (NSAIDs, Alendronate, Calcitonin) and brace. EQ-5D and questionnaires were collected at pre-fracture (retrospective) and post-fracture at first visit, at discharge and after 12-week conservative therapy. Radiographic evaluation was conducted by flexion-extension X-ray and CT. Pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed when the intervertebral cleft was seen in both X-ray and CT, and there was a motion more than 3-degrees in flexion-extension X-rays. Correlations among fracture healing status, brace compliance, and EuroQOL score were investigated. Final follow-up rate was 85% (34/40). RESULT(S): There were 30 patients who could move by themselves (Group A), and other 10 patients who could not even turn over due to severe pain (Group B). EQ-5D at pre-fracture, post-fracture, discharge, and after conservative therapy were 0.9067, 0.5030, 0.7538, and 0.7688 in Group A, 0.7359, -0.0179, 0.5546, and 0.7948 in Group B, respectively. Post-fracture EQ-5D in Group B was significantly lower (p<0.0001). Pseudoarthrosis was found in 6 cases (18%), while the intervertebral cleft was observed in 41 at 12-weeks. All these 6 cases answered as the brace compliance, almost all day"". Average EQ-5D in these 6 cases was 0.2657 at first visit and 0.689 after 12-week therapy, which was significantly lower than that of other fracture healed cases(0.8029, p=0.0001). DISCUSSION: Successful fracture healing rate in this conservative therapy was 82%. Eighteen percent of pseudoarthrosis patients with lower EQ-5D could be candidates for the interventional therapy.""",Excluded
2586,"Feasibility and potential utility of multicomponent exhaled breath analysis for predicting development of radiation pneumonitis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy INTRODUCTION: In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential utility of measuring multiple exhaled gases as biomarkers of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung tumors., METHODS: Breath analysis was performed for 26 patients receiving SABR for lung tumors. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO), nitrous oxide (eN2O), and carbon dioxide (eCO2) were measured before and immediately after each fraction using real-time, infrared laser spectroscopy. RP development (CTCAE grade >=2) was correlated with baseline gas concentrations, acute changes in gas concentrations after each SABR fraction, and dosimetric parameters., RESULTS: Exhaled breath analysis was successfully completed in 77% of patients. Five of 20 evaluable patients developed RP at a mean of 5.4 months after SABR. Acute changes in eNO and eCO concentrations, defined as percent changes between each pre-fraction and post-fraction measurement, were significantly smaller in RP versus non-RP cases (p = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, a combined predictor of baseline eNO greater than 24 parts per billion and acute decrease in eCO less than 5.5% strongly correlated with RP incidence (p =0.0099). Neither eN2O nor eCO2 concentrations were significantly associated with RP development. Although generally higher in patients destined to develop RP, dosimetric parameters were not significantly associated with RP development., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SABR patients in this pilot study were able to complete exhaled breath analysis. Baseline concentrations and acute changes in concentrations of exhaled breath components were associated with RP development after SABR. If our findings are validated, exhaled breath analysis may become a useful approach for noninvasive identification of patients at highest risk for developing RP after SABR.",Excluded
1461,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, glioblastoma multiforme, and impact on toxicities and overall survival: The mayo clinic experience Purpose: The diagnoses of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and depression are often found to coexist. The impact of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) on treatment-related toxicity and outcome in patients with GBM is unclear. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 160 patients with GBM who received treatment at our institution between 1999 and 2008. Those taking an SSRI during treatment for GBM were identified and toxicities were assessed. Result(s): Median survival for the entire cohort was 1.05 years. A total of 35 patients (21.8%) took an SSRI during initial treatment for GBM. There was no statistical difference in the rate of >=grade 3 toxicity in patients taking an SSRI when compared with those who were not (11.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively; P = 1.00). Two-year survival in the cohort of patients taking an SSRI was 32% versus 17% in those who were not (P = 0.18). After making adjustment for age, recursive partitioning analysis class, and extent of surgery, absence of an SSRI during treatment was associated with a hazard risk of 1.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.00-2.42; P = 0.05). Conclusion(s): This retrospective review suggests that concomitant use of an SSRI during treatment does not adversely affect survival. There was no increased toxicity with the use of SSRI concurrent with treatment of newly-diagnosed GBM. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
1154,"Damage-induced apoptosis in primary human lymphocytes is a genetic program modified by gender and age Apoptosis is a core pathway deregulated in hematologic and other cancers. Although there are considerable functional and genetic data on the regulation of apoptosis in vitro and in model organisms, little is known about how these pathways are modified in primary cells freshly isolated from people, who are continually subjected to a variety of different and often unquantified environmental stimuli. We hypothesize that these exposures may have important and as yet unappreciated modifying effects on apoptosis that may have implications for cancer risk or response to therapy. To test this, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 90 normal healthy individuals and treated them with 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR). Damage-induced apoptosis was measured at 24 hours after IR by TUNEL. We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-65 percent. To determine whether this diversity in response was programmed or stochastic, we repeated the experiment 3 times in 10 individuals spanning the entire IR-induced apoptotic range and found results to be completely reproducible within individuals, suggesting that it resulted from a genetic program. We then assessed the association with individual characteristics. Whereas neither race nor age was associated with IR-induced apoptosis, gender was significantly associated (Mean: 44.8% vs 32.9%; p = 1.02 x 10-8). Moreover, when stratified by gender, age was significantly associated with IR-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.026) but not females (p = 0.94). Thus, we conclude that IR-induced apoptosis in freshly isolated human PBMCs results from an intrinsic genetic program modified by age, but only within males. Genetic models to explain this will be discussed.",Included

The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included
39,"A comparison of normal tissue complication probability of brain for proton and photon therapy of canine nasal tumors This study compared the calculated normal tissue complication probability of brain in dogs with a nasal tumor, which had both photon and proton treatment planning. Nine dogs diagnosed with a variety of histologies, but all with large, caudally located nasal tumors were studied. Three-dimensional (3-D) photon dose distribution, and a proton dose distribution was calculated for each dog. To calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for brain, the partial brain volume irradiated with the prescribed dose was determined, then a mathematic model relating complications to partial volume and radiation dose was used. The NTCP was always smaller for proton plans as compared to photon plans, indicating conformation of the dose to the target allows a higher dose to be given. If a 5% NTCP were accepted, the mean applicable dose for this group of dogs was 50.2 Gy for photons, but 58.3 Gy for protons. Not all dogs would benefit the same from proton irradiation. If a large partial brain volume has to be irradiated, the advantage becomes minimal. There is also a minimal advantage if the planning target volume (PTV) includes a small, superficial brain volume. However, for a complex PTV shape the degree of conformation is clearly superior for protons and results in smaller calculated NTCPs.",Excluded

Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05). Interreader agreement was good or excellent for image quality assessment (k = 0.625-0.835).

3039,"Temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy investigated by magnetic resonance imaging: A pilot study Purpose: To concurrently quantify the radiation-induced changes and temporal evolutions of parotid volume and parotid apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 11 NPC patients (9 men and 2 women; 48.7 +/- 11.7 years, 22 parotid glands) were enrolled. Radiation dose, parotid sparing volume, severity of xerostomia, and radiation-to-MR interval (RMI) was recorded. MRI studies were acquired four times, including one before and three after radiotherapy. The parotid volume and the parotid ADC were measured. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS and MedCalc. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Result(s): The parotid volume was 26.2 +/- 8.0 cm3before radiotherapy. The parotid ADC was 0.8 +/- 0.15 x 10-3mm2/sec before radiotherapy. The parotid glands received a radiation dose of 28.7 +/- 4.1 Gy and a PSV of 44.1 +/- 12.6%. The parotid volume was significantly smaller at MR stage 1 and stage 2 as compared to pre-RT stage (P <.005). The volume reduction ratio was 31.2 +/- 13.0%, 26.1 +/- 13.5%, and 17.1 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was significantly higher at all post-RT stages as compared to pre-RT stage reciprocally (P <.005 at stage 1 and 2, P <.05 at stage 3). The ADC increase ratio was 35.7 +/- 17.4%, 27.0 +/- 12.8%, and 20.2 +/- 16.6% at stage 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The parotid ADC was negatively correlated to the parotid volume (R = -0.509; P <.001). The parotid ADC was positively associated with the radiation dose significantly (R2 = 0.212; P =.0001) and was negatively associated with RMI significantly (R2 = 0.203; P =.00096) significantly. Multiple regression analysis further showed that the post-RT parotid ADC was related to the radiation dose and RMI significantly (R2 = 0.3580; P <.0001). At MR stage 3, the parotid volume was negatively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.473; P <.0001), while the parotid ADC was positively associated with the dry mouth grade significantly (R2 = 0.288; P =.015). Conclusion(s): Our pilot study successfully demonstrates the concurrent changes and temporal evolution of parotid volume and parotid ADC quantitatively in NPC patients treated by IMRT. Our results suggest that the reduction of parotid volume and increase of parotid ADC are dominated by the effect of acinar loss rather than edema at early to intermediate phases and the following recovery of parotid volume and ADC toward the baseline values might reflect the acinar regeneration of parotid glands.

1683,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography in the non-invasive evaluation of significant coronary artery disease Aims Multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (CTA) has emerged as a feasible imaging modality for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Recently, 320-row CTA systems were introduced, with 16 cm anatomical coverage, allowing image acquisition of the entire heart within a single heart beat. The aim of the present study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 320-row CTA in patients with known or suspected CAD. Methods and resultsA total of 64 patients (34 male, mean age 61 +/- 16 years) underwent CTA and invasive coronary angiography. All CTA scans were evaluated for the presence of obstructive coronary stenosis by a blinded expert, and results were compared with quantitative coronary angiography. Four patients were excluded from initial analysis due to non-diagnostic image quality. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 88, 92, and 100, respectively. Moreover, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=70 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 94, 95, 88, and 98, respectively. With inclusion of non-diagnostic imaging studies, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to detect >=50 luminal narrowing on a patient basis were 100, 81, 88, and 100, respectively. Conclusion The current study shows that 320-row CTA allows accurate non-invasive assessment of significant CAD. © 2010 The Author.",Excluded
3150,"Pulmonary vein isolation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using high-power short duration radiofrequency or second-generation cryoballoon ablation Background: Differences in the left atrial (LA) tissue loss can occur following different pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) techniques. Purpose(s): Our prospective study compared the biomarker, the LA mechanical, and the electrophysiological findings as indicators of LA myocardial damage after a high-power short duration (HPSD) with contact force radiofrequency catheter and second-generation cryoballoon (CB2) ablation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods :We enrolled 40 patients with paroxysmal AF [16 (40%) women, mean age = 55.9 +/- 12.4 years] who underwent HPSD (n = 21) or CB2 (n = 19). Biomarker levels (hs-cTnT, CK-MB, hs-CRP, LDH) and the transport function of the LA by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were compared pre and post procedurally. High-density mapping (HDM) was performed in sinus rhythm using a multielectrode diagnostic catheter in each group to define isolated left atrial low voltage area (LVA; <0.2mV in bipolar voltage mapping). LA CT-angiography and HDM merge was used to calculate the post-PVI LVA and the LVA/LA surface ratio. Result(s): Postablation hs-cTnT and hs-CRP levels were comparable in the ablation groups (HPSD: 1249 +/- 469 and 9.53 +/- 10.30 vs. CB2: 995 +/- 280 and 12.36 +/- 5.76, p = 0.065 and p = 0.732), while CK-MB and LDH levels were significantly higher following CB2 ablation (HPSD: 6.61 +/- 2.62 and 349.9 +/- 65.6 vs. CB2: 26.01 +/- 6.88 and 451.6 +/- 91.3, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The transport function of the LA did not change significantly by TTE after the procedure. Fractional Area Change at baseline and 3 months was 33.9 +/- 13.8 and 33.5 +/- 10.7 p = 0.9 in the HPSD group while 38.1 +/- 8.6 and 35.3 +/- 12.2 p = 0.9 in the CB2 group. LA Ejection Fraction measured in the two groups (before and 3-month post-procedure): HPSD: 51.2 +/- 20.5% and 49.5 +/- 14.7%, p = 0.9, CB2: 49.7 +/- 15.5% and 50.7 +/- 13.3%, p = 0.8). Ablation time was comparable in the two groups (HPSD: 1676 +/- 570 sec, CB2: 1495 +/- 494 sec, p = 0.279), while fluoroscopy time and radiation exposure were significantly higher in the CB2 group (HPSD: 5.62 +/- 4.31 min and 232 +/- 406 cGycm2, CB2: 13.65 +/- 5.18 min and 1819 +/- 1669 cGycm2, p <0.001 and p <0.001). The LVA/LA surface ratio were: HPSD group: 8.37 +/- 6.42% and CB2 group: 13.58 +/- 8.92% (p = 0.007). At 12-month follow-up, the success rate, defined as freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia without antiarrhythmic drug was 80.1% (HPSD) and 84.2% (CB2) respectively. Conclusion(s): The LA scar tissue was significantly higher following CB2 ablation, but did not affect medium-term efficacy. However, tissue loss did not reduce the transport function of the LA.",Excluded

Materials: We reviewed 104 patients treated using CyberKnife in four institutions. Result(s): Nine cases of skin invasion were recognized (8.6 %). Larger tumors tended to exhibit skin invasion. The skin invasion (+) group showed a lower response rate (0/9, 0 %) than the skin invasion (-) group (56/95, 59 %) (p = 0.002). The skin invasion (+) group showed lower local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) rates, both 0 % at 6 months, than the skin invasion (-) group, which had a LC of 69 % (p = 0.0001) and a PFS of 48 % at 1 year (p = 0.0157). Median survival time and one-year survival rates for the skin invasion (+) and (-) groups were 6.6 vs. 15.3 months and 14 % vs. 59 % (p = 0.0005), respectively. No patient with skin invasion survived more than 14.4 months. The percentage of patients who developed grade 3 or higher toxicity was 44 % in the skin invasion (+) group and 18 % in the skin invasion (-) group (p = 0.14).

1218,"Use of Artificial Intelligence to Reduce Radiation Exposure at Fluoroscopy-Guided Endoscopic Procedures OBJECTIVES:Exposure to ionizing radiation remains a hazard for patients and healthcare providers. We evaluated the utility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled fluoroscopy system to minimize radiation exposure during image-guided endoscopic procedures. METHOD(S):We conducted a prospective study of 100 consecutive patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided endoscopic procedures. Patients underwent interventions using either conventional or AI-equipped fluoroscopy system that uses ultrafast collimation to limit radiation exposure to the region of interest. The main outcome measure was to compare radiation exposure with patients, which was measured by dose area product. Secondary outcome was radiation scatter to endoscopy personnel measured using dosimeter. RESULT(S):Of 100 patients who underwent procedures using traditional (n = 50) or AI-enabled (n = 50) fluoroscopy systems, there was no significant difference in demographics, body mass index, procedural type, and procedural or fluoroscopy time between the conventional and the AI-enabled fluoroscopy systems. Radiation exposure to patients was lower (median dose area product 2,178 vs 5,708 mGym2, P = 0.001) and scatter effect to endoscopy personnel was less (total deep dose equivalent 0.28 vs 0.69 mSv; difference of 59.4%) for AI-enabled fluoroscopy as compared to conventional system. On multivariate linear regression analysis, after adjusting for patient characteristics, procedural/fluoroscopy duration, and type of fluoroscopy system, only AI-equipped fluoroscopy system (coefficient 3,331.9 [95% confidence interval: 1,926.8-4,737.1, P < 0.001) and fluoroscopy duration (coefficient 813.2 [95% confidence interval: 640.5-985.9], P < 0.001) were associated with radiation exposure.DISCUSSION:The AI-enabled fluoroscopy system significantly reduces radiation exposure to patients and scatter effect to endoscopy personnel (see Graphical abstract, Supplementary Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/AJG/B461).Copyright © 2020 by The American College of Gastroenterology.",Excluded

Median values were as follows: prescription dose, 60 Gy (range, 50-70); PTV(D95), 99% (range, 79-101%); optic nerve Dmax, 53 Gy (range, 2-54); optic chiasm Dmax, 51Gy (range, 2-55). Acute and late toxicities were scored by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group morbidity criteria., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 28 months. Two-year local progression-free and overall survivals were 75% and 80%. No early- or late-grade 3/4 radiation-induced ophthalmologic toxicity occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that adjuvant IMRT in these patients is feasible, allowed for excellent planning target volume (PTV) coverage, and minimized dose delivered to optic structures.

432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded
765,"Sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients., METHODS: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

1578,"Minimizing radiation exposure during ERCP by avoiding live or continuous fluoroscopy Goals: The aim of this study was to assess the cumulative radiation exposure incurred by patients when using single-frame fluoroscopy. Background(s): Single-frame fluoroscopy is a technique that can be used instead of pulsed fluoroscopy or continuous live fluoroscopy to minimize radiation exposure during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Study: We retrospectively reviewed ERCPs performed at our academic medical center. We recorded fluoroscopy time (FT, minutes), total radiation dose (mGy), dose area product (DAP, Gycm2), and effective dose (ED, mSv). ERCP degree of difficulty was graded based on procedure complexity level. Result(s): There were 400 ERCP procedures performed on 210 patients, 32 ERCPs were unsuccessful. The mean FT for all procedures was 1.57 minutes (median, 1.2 min); the mean FT for complexity score 1 procedures (0.78 min) was significantly shorter than for all other procedures (P<0.0001). The mean total radiation dose delivered for all procedures was 23.02mGy (median, 14.95 mGy). The total radiation dose for complexity score 1 procedures (13.15 mGy) was significantly lower than for all other complexity scores (P<0.0001). The mean total DAP was 3.62Gycm2 and the mean ED was 0.94 mSv. Procedure complexity score 1 DAP (2.1Gycm2) and ED (0.55 mSv) were significantly lower than for all other procedures (P<0.0001 for both). There was no statistically significant difference in these parameters when comparing successful and unsuccessful procedures. Conclusion(s): Successful ERCP can be performed using single-frame fluoroscopy only. Our results demonstrate lower radiation exposure using this technique than what is reported in the literature.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
271,"Increased lung cancer risk due to residential radon in a pooled and extended analysis of studies in Germany Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes. This analysis strengthens the evidence that residential radon is a relevant risk factor for lung cancer.",Included
2004,"Evaluation of PRRT after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery as established technique ('Aretaieion' Protocol) using 111In-DTPA-Phe1 octreotide in inoperable liver metastases due to neuroendocrine tumors Aim/Introduction: To evaluate the efficacy of Auger and Internal Conversion Electron Emission of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide and their tumoricidal effectiveness due to their high LET, in inoperable liver metastases, positive for sst2 receptor over-expression (verified by Octreoscan and confirmed by biopsy) due to neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Material(s) and Method(s): In 86 patients 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide was implemented after selective catheterization of the hepatic artery, in an average activity of 6.3+/-1.3 GBq per patient/ per session, consecutively, with a time interval between sessions of 6-8 weeks. Infusion repetition did not exceed the 12 sessions. Patients, being under repeated Sandostatin-LAR treatment (30 mg per 20 days) did not discontinued the dosage but they were intramuscularly injected 15-20 days prior to the radioactive session. To reduce myelotoxicity, 75 mg of DTPA in trip-trop diluted in about 200 ml normal saline water was infused 30 min before the initialization of the radiopeptide therapy, lasting for about 4 hrs. For the assessment of response, RECIST 1.1 standards were used. CT/MRI scans before, during and after the end of the whole procedure, as well as U/S images at monthly basis were performed. Absorbed doses delivered to metastases, kidneys and red marrow were calculated according to OLINDA/EXM 1.1 program. Toxicity (World Health Organization criteria) was measured using blood and urine tests of renal, hepatic and bone marrow function. Result(s): Three patients resulted in complete response (3.5%); partial response was assessed in 46 (53.5 %), disease stabilization in 21 (24.4 %) and progressive disease in 16 (18.6%). The median PFS and OS were estimated to be 32 and 47.5 months, respectively. The organ average radiation dose was estimated as follows: (a) Liver Tumor 15.2 mGy/MBq, (b) Liver 0.14 mGy/MBq, (c) Kidneys 0.41 mGy/ MBq, (d) Spleen 1.4 mGy/MBq and (f ) Bone marrow 0.0032 mGy/MBq. The average absorbed dose per session to a tumour for a spherical mass of 10 gr was estimated to be 10.8 mGy/MBq, depending on the histotype of the tumour. WHO toxicity grade 2 to 3 erythro-, leuko-and thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 (10.5%) cases observed about after the 3rd session. Conclusion(s): In unresectable metastatic liver lesions, positive for somatostatin receptors, repeated, transhepatic high doses of 111In-DTPA-Phe1-Octreotide resulted in an optimal therapeutic outcome with a disease control (CR+PR+SD) in an about 82 % of the treated patients.

2406,"Human mononuclear cell in vitro activation in microgravity and post-spaceflight The results of postflight and inflight human in vitro lymphocyte experiments have been reviewed. The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded

2037,"The impact of the effective dose to immune cells on lymphopenia and survival of esophageal cancer after chemoradiotherapy Purpose: To test the hypothesis that effective dose to circulating immune cells (EDIC) impacts the severity of radiation-induced lymphopenia and clinical outcomes of esophageal cancer patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Material(s) and Method(s): 488 esophageal cancer patients treated with CCRT with and without surgery were analyzed. The EDIC model considers the exposure of circulating immune cells as the proportion of blood flow to lung, heart, liver, and the volume of the exposed area of the body, with the basis of mean lung dose (MLD), mean heart dose (MHD), mean liver dose (MlD), and integral dose (ITD) of the body region scanned, calculated as: EDIC=0.12*MLD+0.08*MHD+0.15*0.85*MlD*[Formula presented]1/2+0.45+0.35*0.85*[Formula presented]1/2*[Formula presented] Where n is the fraction number. Correlations of EDIC with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), and locoregional control (LRC) rates were analyzed using both univariable and multivariable Cox models. Lymphopenia during CCRT was graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Grade 4 lymphopenia resulted in inferior clinical outcomes, including OS, PFS, and DMFS. The median EDIC was 3.6 Gy (range, 0.8-6.0 Gy). Higher EDIC was strongly associated with severe lymphopenia, particularly when EDIC was above 4 Gy. Patients with EDIC > 4.0 Gy had more G4 lymphopenia than those with EDIC <= 4.0 Gy (67.3% vs. 40.8%; P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, increasing EDIC was independently and inversely associated with worse OS, PFS, and DMFS. Conclusion(s): EDIC can be recommended as a useful tool to predict lymphopenia and inferior clinical outcomes, and it should be minimized below 4 Gy.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1722,"The maximum tolerated dose of gamma radiation to the optic nerve during gamma knife radiosurgery in an animal study BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

Clinical information and radiation dose were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion(s): CT venography using ASIR-V at 70 kVp was better than MBIR at 80 kVp in terms of image quality and reconstruction time at similar radiation doses.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded

An estimate of the collective effective dose and the number of fatal malignancies as well as a calculation of the monies which could be justifiably spent in reducing the collective effective dose and hence the number of fatal malignancies by a shift from photofluorography to ""full size"" radiography will be given.",Included
1923,"Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors Purpose: The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence. Method(s): The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for >=12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors. Result(s): Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2 %) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2 %) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0 %) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8 %) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age <40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter >=10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications. Conclusion(s): The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
849,"Quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography for prediction of pain relief in metastatic bone disease treated with rhenium-186 etidronate PURPOSE: To calculate radiation doses of rhenium-186 ((186)Re) etidronate in painful bone metastases using quantitative bone single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to determine the threshold dose for predicting pain relief. We also wanted to determine whether technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) concentrations predict radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful lesions., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Patients received therapeutic doses of (186)Re etidronate. The area under the pain over time curve (AUPC) was measured for 8 weeks after treatment. Response was calculated as the percentage of change in AUPC. Quantitative bone SPECT (QBS)-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate was used for calculating radiation doses. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis determined the radiation dose threshold that best separated responders from nonresponders. SPECT-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate in the urinary bladder was correlated with its concentration in the voided urine. Concentration of (99m)Tc MDP was compared with radiation doses to painful metastases., RESULTS: The radiation dose threshold was 2.10 Gy. For a decrease of 50% in the AUPC, the positive predictive value (PPV) of this value was 75% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88%. For a decrease in pain of 33%, the PPV was 84% and the NPV was 81%. In prostate cancer patients only, the PPV was 81% and the NPV was 92%. The correlation between in vivo/in vitro measured urine concentration was 0.90. The correlation between (99m)Tc MDP concentration and radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate was 0.92., CONCLUSION: QBS-measured radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful metastases are a good predictor of pain relief. Bone SPECT using (99m)Tc MDP predicts radiation doses delivered by (186)Re etidronate.",Excluded
360,"Factors associated with presence and extent of coronary calcium in those predicted to be at low risk according to Framingham risk score (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Even among asymptomatic persons at low risk (<10%) according to the Framingham risk score, high coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores signify a greater predicted risk of coronary heart disease events. We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

2820,"Irradiation of cochlear structures during vestibular schwannoma radiosurgery and associated hearing outcome Object. The purpose of this study was to measure the dose of radiation delivered to the cochlea during a Gamma knife surgery (GKS) procedure for treatment of patients with vestibular schwannomas (VSs), and to analyze the relationship between cochlear irradiation and the hearing outcome of these patients. Methods. Eighty-two patients with VSs were treated with GKS using a marginal dose of 12 Gy. No patient had neurofibromatosis Type 2 disease, and all had a Gardner-Robertson hearing class of I to IV before treatment, and a radiological and audiological follow-up of at least 1-year after GKS. The dosimetric data of the volume of the cochlea were retrospectively analyzed and were correlated with the auditory outcome of patients. Results. The mean radiation dose delivered to the cochlear volume ranged from 1.30 to 10.00 Gy (median 4.15 Gy). The cochlea received significantly higher radiation doses in patients with worsening of hearing after GKS. A highly significant association between the cochlear and the intracanalicular dose of radiation delivered during GKS was found. Conclusions. During GKS for VSs, relatively high doses of radiation can be delivered to the cochlea. Worsening of hearing after GKS can be the consequence of either radiation injury to the cochlea or the irradiation dose delivered into the auditory canal, or both.",Excluded
54,"Effects on human skin of repetitive ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) irradiation and visible light Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a variety of effects on human skin. Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that suberythemal doses of UVA1 and even visible light may cause DNA damage.",Excluded
3093,"Detection of renal dysfunction by point-of-care creatinine testing in patients undergoing peripheral MR angiography OBJECTIVE. The objective of our study was to analyze the effectiveness of prestudy questionnaires in identifying at-risk patients and estimate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk factors, and other comorbidities in patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity MR angiography (MRA) studies using gadoliniumbased contrast agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patent demographics, comorbidities, contrast type, and point-of-care (POC) serum creatinine values were recorded from the medical records of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity MRA examinations in a single year. Patients were divided into groups by CKD stage (non-CKD, stage III, stage IV, or stage V) on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate values determined from POC creatinine results. Patient awareness of a history of CKD was noted if patients admitted to any form of CKD on prestudy questionnaires. RESULTS. Of 199 patients, 72 patients (36.2%) had stage III CKD, six patients (3.0%) had stage IV CKD, and seven patients (3.5%) had stage V CKD. Comorbidities - including smoking status, transplant status, and presence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease - as well as administered contrast type and dosage showed significant differences among the CKD groups (p < 0.05). Only five stage III patients (7%) were aware of any history of renal dysfunction, whereas three stage IV patients (50%) and seven stage V patients (100%) admitted any history of renal dysfunction via questionnaires. CONCLUSION. Compared with POC creatinine testing, a prestudy questionnaire used alone is ineffective in identifying all patients with histories of CKD who are scheduled to undergo gadolinium-based peripheral MRA studies. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

2958,"Long-term outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for intracranial skull base benign meningiomas in single institution Objective: To investigate the outcome of linac-based fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy over the last 10 years for intracranial skull base benign meningiomas in patients who were inoperable, who had residual tumors with some components of high mitotic index after surgery and who experienced relapse of the tumor. Method(s): Twenty-seven patients with intracranial skull base benign meningiomas treated with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven cases were diagnosed as benign meningiomas on pathological (17 cases) or radiological (10 cases) examination. The median follow-up time was 90 months after initial treatment and 63 months after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The median biological equivalent dose calculated using an alpha/beta ratio of 2.0 Gy was 82.0 Gy (range, 60-106 Gy). Result(s): The 5-year overall survival was 95.7 (95% confidence interval: 87.3-100)% after initial treatment and 96.2 (88.8-100)% after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The 5-year overall survival and local control rate of patients who received4/8/2011 fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy alone were both 100%. The 5-year progression-free survival and local control rate after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy were all 100% with a tumor volume of <9.1 cc and 68.2 (37.2-99.2) and 75.8 (45.2-100)% for the tumors 9.1 cc, respectively. The difference was significant in progression-free survival (P = 0.022) and local control rate (P = 0.044). The local control rate was significantly worse in patients who received fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for relapsed tumors (P = 0.01). No late radiation damage was observed in the follow-up period. Conclusion(s): The long-term outcome suggests that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for intracranial skull base benign meningioma, especially for those who have tumors <9.1 cc or would receive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy with or without surgery as the initial treatment. © The Author (2010).

327,"Radiation risks to lymphoma patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies Background: To investigate radiation risks to patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies that take into account patient age, sex, and weight. Method(s): We obtained patient demographics and weights of 54 consecutive patients with lymphoma who each underwent a18F-FDG PET study. The administered activity was converted into an effective dose using the patient size dependent dosimetry data provided in ICRP Publication 80. Patient effective doses were converted into estimates of the lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence and cancer mortality using age and sex dependent risk factors provided in BEIR VII. Result(s): The average patient age/weight in this study was 43 years/68 kg for males and 33 years/61 kg for females. Patient effective dose are proportional to patient weight(-0.784) (r2 >0.99). The average administered activity was 410 MBq, which resulted in an average effective dose of 8.5 mSv for males and 8.9 mSv for females. The average cancer incidence was 0.71/1,000 cases for males, and 1.27/1,000 cases for females, with cancer mortality being about half the incidence. Cancer rates for the youngest patients were an order of magnitude higher than those for the oldest patients. Conclusion(s): Average lifetime attributable cancer risks to lymphoma patients from a single FDG-PET study is approximately 1 per 1,000, but are strongly influenced by patient age, gender and weight. Cancer risk in younger patients is a magnitude of order greater.",Excluded
1311,"Response Evaluation of Choroidal Melanoma After Brachytherapy Using Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DW-MRI): Preliminary Findings Purpose: To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) in the assessment of therapeutic response in patients with choroidal melanoma treated with brachytherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a prospective, unicentric study which included patients with choroidal melanoma and indication for brachytherapy. Three DW-MRI examinations were proposed for each patient, one before and two after treatment. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated on DW-MRI and compared with local tumor control assessed by ophthalmologic follow-up. Result(s): From 07/2018 to 06/2019, 19 patients were recruited, 13 of whom underwent follow-up examinations. Patients' ages ranged from 24 to 78 years and 52.9% were male. At the ocular ultrasound, the mean tumor thickness and diameter were 6.3 and 11.5 mm, respectively. Two patients (15.4%) showed signs of tumor progression during follow-up (7 and 9 months after treatment). There was no statistically significant difference in tumor size between MR before and after treatment, however, there was a significant reduction in mean ADC in patients with progression (p = 0.02). Conclusion(s): DW-MRI is a promising method for monitoring patients with choroidal melanoma; reduction in the mean ADC values between pre-treatment MRI and the first post-treatment MRI may be related to the lack of response to brachytherapy and increased risk of disease progression.© Copyright © 2020 Bitencourt, Bitencourt, Chojniak, Souza, Castro, Pellizzon and Chojniak.",Excluded
663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2844,"Radioiodine treatment of multinodular non-toxic goitre OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long term effect of radioactive iodine on thyroid function and size in patients with non-toxic multinodular goitre., DESIGN: Consecutive patients with multinodular non-toxic goitre selected for radioactive iodine treatment and followed for a minimum of 12 months (median 48 months) after an intended dose of 3.7 MBq/g thyroid tissue corrected to a 100% uptake of iodine-131 in 24 hours., PATIENTS: 69 patients with a growing multinodular non-toxic goitre causing local compression symptoms or cosmetic inconveniences. The treatment was chosen because of a high operative risk, previous thyroidectomy, or refusal to be operated on., MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Standard thyroid function variables and ultrasonically determined thyroid volume before treatment as well as 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment and then once a year., RESULTS: 56 patients were treated with a single dose of 131I, 12 with two doses, and one with four doses. In 45 patients treated with one dose and remaining euthyroid the median thyroid volume was reduced from 73 (interquartile range 50-106) ml to 29 (23-48) ml at 24 months in the 39 patients in whom this was measured during follow up. The median reduction was 40 (22-48) ml (60% reduction, p < 0.0001), half of which occurred within three months. Patients treated with two doses as well as those developing hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism had a significant reduction in thyroid volume. Eleven patients developed hypothyroidism (cumulative five year risk 22%, 95% confidence interval 4.8% to 38.4%). Side effects were few: three cases of hyperthyroidism and two cases of radiation thyroiditis. Only one patient was dissatisfied with the result; she was referred for operation six months after treatment., CONCLUSIONS: A substantial reduction in thyroid volume accompanied by a low incidence of hypothyroidism and few side effects makes the use of radioactive iodine an attractive alternative to surgery in selected cases of non-toxic multinodular goitre.",Excluded
2910,"Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma BACKGROUND/AIMS: Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) has recently been introduced as a new treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan. This study was performed to evaluate its efficacy and safety., METHODOLOGY: Thirteen patients with 17 nodules of unresectable HCC were subjected to PMCT under ultrasonic guidance. The tumors ranged from 1.2-4.4 cm in size. Assessment of the efficacy of PMCT was made by follow-up with dynamic computed tomography (CT)., RESULTS: In the patients with small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm), 5 out of 7 nodules developed local recurrence after PMCT. Regarding assessment of the necrotic area after PMCT, dynamic CT revealed enhancement that was possibly caused by congestion of the liver parenchyma surrounding the area of necrosis due to PMCT in the early phase of the treatment. Therefore, the necrotic area must be assessed carefully. Although a slight heat sensation and/or pain during microwave irradiation (a common effect of PMCT) occurred in all patients, there were no serious adverse effects., CONCLUSIONS: Complete remission of small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm). There were no serious adverse effects from PMCT and the therapy can be safely carried out even in patients with poor liver function.",Excluded

Dilation with simultaneous use of two cylindrical dilators provides a novel, physiology-based approach to UES distention. We evaluated the initial safety and efficacy of UES dilation with simultaneous use of two controlled radial expansion balloon dilators., METHODS: Using a computerized database, we reviewed the charts of all persons who underwent UES dilation with simultaneous use of two radial expansion balloon dilators between December 1, 2011, and March 15, 2012. Information regarding patient demographics, indications, technique, and complications was abstracted. Self-reported swallowing impairment was assessed with the validated 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)., RESULTS: Ten individuals underwent simultaneous dilation with two dilators. Their mean age was 65 years (SD, 14 years), and 7 (70%) of them were male. The indications for dilation were radiation-induced UES stenosis (50%), cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (30%), upper esophageal web (10%), and anastomotic stricture (10%). After the double-balloon dilation, no complications were reported. The mean EAT-10 score improved significantly, from 34.3 (SD, 13.5) to 16.7 (SD, 8.4), after the simultaneous dilation (p = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data suggest that simultaneous dilation of the UES with two controlled radial expansion balloon dilators is feasible, safe, and effective.

Method Patients with localised gastric MALT lymphoma persisting after H. pylori eradication were offered moderate-dose RT (30 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction) and followed with annual endoscopies. All biopsies before and after RT were reviewed by a committee of pathologists. Results From 1995 to 2011, out of the 232 patients followed prospectively, 53 received RT for persistence of lymphoma after H. pylori eradication: either macroscopic ulcer (n = 31), or microscopic lymphomatous infiltrate (n = 22), after a mean follow-up of 12 and 31 months, respectively. All lymphomas were localised (45 stage IE and 8 stage IIE) and 38 (72%) were H. pylori-positive. The mean clinical and endoscopic follow-up from diagnosis was 7.6 years (2.2-19.1). No acute or late toxicity occurred. A complete remission was achieved in all patients but one (98%) with no relapse after a median follow-up of 4.9 years (1.3-16.6) after completion of RT. Overall survival and 5-year disease specific survival were 94% and 100%, respectively. One patient died of gastric adenocarcinoma.

However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases. Mean dose at the operating surgeon's right finger was significantly higher than other measurements parts (P,0.001). The operating surgeon's effective doses (0.06, 0.06, and 0.07 mSv for 1, 2, and 3 fusion levels) were low, and didn't differ significantly from those of the assisting surgeon or radiological technologist. Revision MIS-TLIF was not associated with higher surgeons' radiation doses compared to primary MIS-TLIF. There were significantly higher surgeons' radiation doses in over-weight than in normal-weight patients. The surgeons' radiation exposure during MIS-TLIF was within the safe level by the International Commission on Radiological Protection's guidelines. The accumulated radiation exposure, especially to surgeon's hands, should be carefully monitored. © 2014 Funao et al.",Excluded
3366,"Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia After Corneal Graft Purpose: To describe the clinical features and management of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) after corneal graft. Design(s): Retrospective case series of 4 patients. Method(s): Four eyes of 4 patients treated for OSSN after corneal graft in an institutional setting were included. All 4 patients were treated with topical chemotherapy and additionally 1 patient each was treated with excisional biopsy and photodynamic therapy. The main outcome measure was the recurrence of OSSN and the clarity of corneal graft after treatment. Result(s): The mean time interval between corneal graft and diagnosis of OSSN was 36 months (range, 2 to 73 months). All 4 eyes were on chronic treatment with topical steroids for a minimum duration of 2 months and 2 eyes had previous herpes keratitis. Misdiagnosis of graft rejection was found in 2 cases. The mean tumor basal diameter was 18 mm (range, 14- to 25-mm) and the tumor involved a mean of 76% of the corneal surface (range, 15% to 90%). Management was successful in all cases using topical mitomycin C (n = 1), topical interferon alpha2b (n = 4), and photodynamic therapy (n = 1). At mean follow-up of 20 months, tumor control was achieved in all cases and all 4 eyes showed chronic graft opacification with vascularization but no intraocular tumor. Conclusion(s): Corneal OSSN should be considered in patients using chronic topical steroids for corneal graft. Nonsurgical management with topical chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy can achieve tumor control. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2733,"Comparison of I-131 radioimmunotherapy tumor dosimetry: Unit density sphere model versus patient-specific monte carlo calculations High computational requirements restrict the use of Monte Carlo algorithms for dose estimation in a clinical setting, despite the fact that they are considered more accurate than traditional methods. The goal of this study was to compare mean tumor absorbed dose estimates using the unit density sphere model incorporated in OLINDA with previously reported dose estimates from Monte Carlo simulations using the dose planning method (DPMMC) particle transport algorithm. The dataset (57 tumors, 19 lymphoma patients who underwent SPECT/CT imaging during I-131 radioimmunotherapy) included tumors of varying size, shape, and contrast. OLINDA calculations were first carried out using the baseline tumor volume and residence time from SPECT/CT imaging during 6 days post-tracer and 8 days post-therapy. Next, the OLINDA calculation was split over multiple time periods and summed to get the total dose, which accounted for the changes in tumor size. Results from the second calculation were compared with results determined by coupling SPECT/CT images with DPM Monte Carlo algorithms. Results from the OLINDA calculation accounting for changes in tumor size were almost always higher (median 22%, range-1%-68%) than the results from OLINDA using the baseline tumor volume because of tumor shrinkage. There was good agreement (median-5%, range-13%-2%) between the OLINDA results and the self-dose component from Monte Carlo calculations, indicating that tumor shape effects are a minor source of error when using the sphere model. However, because the sphere model ignores cross-irradiation, the OLINDA calculation significantly underestimated (median 14%, range 2%-31%) the total tumor absorbed dose compared with Monte Carlo. These results show that when the quantity of interest is the mean tumor absorbed dose, the unit density sphere model is a practical alternative to Monte Carlo for some applications. For applications requiring higher accuracy, computer-intensive Monte Carlo calculation is needed. © 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
3264,"Glypican-3-mediated inhibition of CD26 by TFPI: a novel mechanism in hematopoietic stem cell homing and maintenance Directional migration determines hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) homing, which depends upon the interaction between the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4. CD26 is a widely expressed membrane-bound ectopeptidase that cleaves CXCL12 thereby depleting its chemokine activity. We identified tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as a biological inhibitor of CD26 in murine and human HSPCs. We observed low-level TFPI expression in endothelial cells in the bone marrow (BM), which did not increase following radiation injury. Treatment of HSPCs with TFPI in vitro led to enhanced HSPC migration toward CXCL12, as well as homing and engraftment in the BM upon transplantation. We found that Glypican-3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on murine as well as human HSPCs, mediated this effect. TFPI did not affect CD26 activity, migration, or homing of GPC3(-/-) HSPCs, while it affected GPC1(-/-) HSPCs similar to wild-type HSPCs. Moreover, proliferation of GPC3(-/-) but not GPC1(-/-) BM HSPCs was significantly increased, which was associated with a decrease in the primitive HSC pool in BM and an increase in proportion of the circulating HSPCs in the peripheral blood. Hence, we present a novel role for TFPI and GPC3 in regulating HSC homing as well as retention in the BM.",Excluded
249,"Inter-laboratory consistency and variability in the buccal micronucleus cytome assay depends on biomarker scored and laboratory experience: results from the HUMNxl international inter-laboratory scoring exercise The buccal micronucleus cytome (BMNcyt) assay in uncultured exfoliated epithelial cells from oral mucosa is widely applied in biomonitoring human exposures to genotoxic agents and is also proposed as a suitable test for prescreening and follow-up of precancerous oral lesions. The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

3345,"Evaluation of the dedicated Frontier coronary bifurcation stent: A matched pair analysis with drug-eluting and bare metal stents Treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions (CBL) remains challenging. This study sought to evaluate a novel dedicated stent system (Frontier stent) by angiographic and clinical comparison with the provisional T-stenting technique using drug-eluting (DES) and bare metal stents (BMS). The study group comprised 105 CBL in 105 patients. 35 consecutive CBL were treated with the Frontier system. The control group of 70 CBL (35 DES, 35 BMS) was pair matched with the former group stratified by the type of CBL (Medina classification) and the reference diameter of the main branch (MB). Clinical, procedural, and quantitative angiographic data (QCA) were obtained in all patients. A follow-up angiography 6 +/- 2-month post-index intervention was performed in 84/105 (80%) patients, clinical 6-month follow-up was available in all patients (100%). All Frontier stent procedures were clinically and angiographically successful. Post-procedural QCA analysis of the MB and the side branches revealed comparable minimal lumen diameters (MLDs) between groups. Moreover, contrast use and radiation exposure were not different between groups. DES use, however, was associated with a significantly lower late lumen (LL) loss in the main and the side branch as compared to the Frontier stent and BMS group. Likewise, MACE rates were lowest in the DES group (6%, P < 0.05 vs. BMS) as compared to the Frontier stent (9%) and the BMS group (16%). The Frontier stent accomplishes treatment of CBL with excellent acute clinical, procedural, and angiographic results. Provisional T-stenting using DES provides superior clinical and angiographic long-term results as compared to BMS and Frontier stents. The results of next generation CBL systems combining a dedicated specific CBL design with DES surfaces are to be awaited.",Excluded
810,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL.",Excluded
1437,"Assessment of aortic annulus dimensions for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with high-pitch dual-source CT: Comparison of systolic high-pitch vs. multiphasic data acquisition Objectives: To evaluate a systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac computed tomography (CT) angiography for planning transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Method(s): Patients referred for TAVI underwent a combined CT imaging with retrospective, multiphasic ECG-gating of the heart and systolic ECG-gated high-pitch aortoiliac CT angiography. Consecutive patients were retrospectively included in this study group. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were assessed during the high-pitch ECG prediction phase. Aortic annulus area (AAA) was planimetrically quantified on both datasets. While only one moment of cardiac cycle was available for measurements in the high-pitch CT, the point of time in the multiphasic CT was chosen, where AAA yielded maximum size. Hypothetical prosthesis sizing was compared between multiphasic vs. high-pitch CT. Result(s): Among 61 patients (44.2 % men, mean age: 83.3 +/- 5.5 years) average heart rate and HRV were 71.0 +/- 13.4 bpm and 7.3 +/- 8.5 bpm. 20 patients (32.7 %) had atrial fibrillation at the time of image acquisition. There was a strong correlation of AAA as derived from multiphasic vs. the high-pitch CT (r = 0.98). The difference in AAA was 10.5 +/- 17.1mm2 (455.1 +/- 83.0 mm2 for multiphasic vs. 444.5 +/- 87.2 mm2 for high-pitch CT) and did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.08). Hypothetical prosthesis sizing showed an agreement in 55 of 61 patients (90.2 %). A sizing based on the high-pitch CT resulted in smaller prosthesis choice in 6 patients, all of them suffering from atrial fibrillation. Mean effective radiation dose was 10.9 +/- 6.1 mSv for cardiac CTA and 4.1 +/- 1.0 mSv for high-pitch CTA. Conclusion(s): For patients with sinus rhythm, systolic high-pitch aortoiliac CTA provides adequate prosthesis size selection as compared with multiphasic ECG-gated cardiac CTA and may result in significantly reduced radiation exposition.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

PARTICIPANTS /CONTROLS: Sixty-five case subjects were matched with 175 control subjects. Individuals with unequivocal evidence of angiographically confirmed IPT were included as cases. Control subjects were matched for center, age, and gender., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main exposures of interest were a history of therapeutic head or neck irradiation and environmental radiation exposure., METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was administered to case and control subjects. Data were collected for the main exposures of interest as well as pertinent covariates. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate therapeutic and environmental radiation as risks for IPT., RESULTS: On univariate analysis, head or neck irradiation was associated with IPT (odds ratios [OR] = 4.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30-13.24). While controlling for diabetes and family history of diabetes, IPT was found to be associated with both head or neck irradiation (OR = 4.06, 95% CI = 1.20-13.76) and with environmental irradiation (OR = 6.73, 95% CI = 1.06-42.74)., CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a previously unreported association between prior radiation exposure and IPT.",Included
3351,"Capability of abdominal 320-detector row CT for small vasculature assessment compared with that of 64-detector row CT Objective: To compare the capability of 320-detector row CT (area-detector CT: ADCT) with step-and-shoot scan protocol for small abdominal vasculature assessment with that of 64-detector row CT with helical scan protocol. Material(s) and Method(s): Total of 60 patients underwent contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for preoperative assessment. Of all, 30 suspected to have lung cancer underwent ADCT using step-and-shoot scan protocol. The other 30 suspected to have renal cell carcinoma underwent 64-MDCT using helical scan protocol. Two experienced radiologists independently assessed inferior epigastric, hepatic subsegmental (in the segment 8), mesenteric marginal (Griffith point) and inferior phrenic arteries by using 5-point visual scoring systems. Kappa analysis was used for evaluation of interobserver agreement. To compare the visualization capability of the two systems, the Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the scores for each of the arteries. Result(s): Overall interobserver agreements for both systems were almost perfect (kappa > 0.80). Visualization scores for inferior epigastric and mesenteric arteries were significantly higher for ADCT than for 64-detector row CT (p < 0.05). No significant difference was found for hepatic subsegmental and inferior phrenic arteries.

2133,"[Assessment of clinical image quality in feline chest radiography with a needle-image plate (NIP) storage phosphor system--an approach to the evaluation of image quality in neonatal radiography] PURPOSE: Is the image quality of thoracic radiographs of cats obtained with a needle-based storage phosphor (NIP) system superior to conventional (PIP) storage phosphor radiography? Is it possible to decrease the mAs by 50 % with the NIP system without significant loss of information?, MATERIALS AND METHODS: From each of the 20 animals, three lateral radiographs were acquired. The assessment of the exposure level was based on the generated lgM-values. Images were acquired 1. with the NIP system and exposure settings equivalent to an lgM of 1.9, 2. with the PIP system and identical settings, and 3. with the NIP system and 50 % of the mAs. Six blinded readers used a 5-step scale to assess the reproducibility of five anatomical structures and image noise sensation. Data were analysed using Visual Grading Characteristics Analysis (VGC)., RESULTS: While applying identical exposure values the NIP system for all features revealed superior ratings to those of the PIP system (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.81 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.92 for ""trachea""). Even when reducing mAs by 50 % in the NIP images all features were rated better compared with the PIP images and original settings (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.60 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.74 for ""trachea"" and ""caudal thoracic field"")., CONCLUSION: The NIP system demonstrates clearly better image quality compared to the reference PIP system. A dose reduction of 50 % seems to be possible without relevant detraction from image quality. The results obtained in the animal model are valid for simulating conditions in neonatal radiological practise.",Excluded
2202,"Organ doses, effective dose, and cancer risk from coronary CT angiography examinations OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to determine organ and effective doses and to estimate the risk of exposure-induced cancer death (REID) associated with coronary CT angiography (CCTA) examinations. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. CCTA examinations were performed in three stages: calcium score, monitoring, and cardiac phases for all patients. Effective dose was calculated using two methods. The first was based on the scanner-derived dose-length product, and the second entailed use of an organ and effective dose calculator software application. Organ doses were calculated on the basis of the tissue weighting factors of International Commission on Radiation Protection report 103. REID values were assessed with a cancer risk estimator software application. RESULTS. The study included 185 patients (95 men, 90 women). For women, breast doses were high at 52.04 +/- 14.08 mGy. The mean effective dose in the women was greater than that in the men (24.05 vs 16.30 mSv, p < 0.05). The mean REID values in patients undergoing CCTA with a 64-MDCT scanner were 13.4 per 10,000 men (1 in 746) and 19.6 per 10,000 women (1 in 508). The REID values were considerably higher for the younger women. CONCLUSION. The results of this study will help referring physicians justify requesting CCTA examinations by considering their benefits for diagnosis on the one hand and awareness of the risk of radiation-induced cancer on the other. In the case of CCTA scans that are properly justified by clinical indication, patients and physicians should not be concerned about the radiation risks.Copyright © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1911,"Somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus and the dorsal cochlear nucleus hypothesis Purpose: Of all nonauditory sensory systems, only the somatosensory system seems to be related to tinnitus (eg, temporomandibular joint syndrome and whiplash). The purpose of this study is to describe the distinguishing characteristics of tinnitus associated with somatic events and to use these characteristics to develop a neurological model of somatic tinnitus. Material(s) and Method(s): Case series. Result(s): Some patients with tinnitus, but no other hearing complaints, share several clinical features including (1) an associated somatic disorder of the head or upper neck, (2) localization of the tinnitus to the ear ipsilateral to the somatic disorder, (3) no vestibular complaints, and (4) no abnormalities on neurological examination. Pure tone and speech audiometry of the 2 ears is always symmetric and usually within normal limits. Based on these clinical features, it is proposed that somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus, like otic tinnitus, is caused by disinhibition of the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus. Nerve fibers whose cell bodies lie in the ipsilateral medullary somatosensory nuclei mediate this effect. These neurons receive inputs from nearby spinal trigeminal tract, fasciculus cuneatus, and facial, vagal, and glossopharyngeal nerve fibers innervating the middle and external ear. Conclusion(s): Somatic (craniocervical) modulation of the dorsal cochlear nucleus may account for many previously poorly understood aspects of tinnitus and suggests novel tinnitus treatments.",Excluded
3129,"Total mesorectal excision (TME) with or without preoperative radiotherapy in the treatment of primary rectal cancer: Prospective randomised trial with standard operative and histopathological techniques Objective: To document local recurrence in primary rectal cancer when standardised techniques of surgery, radiotherapy, and pathology are used, and to investigate whether the local recurrence rate after total mesorectal excision permits the omission of adjuvant short term preoperative radiotherapy. Design(s): Prospective randomised study. Setting(s): Dutch (n = 80), English (n = 1), German (n = 1), Swedish (n = 9), and Swiss (n = 1) hospitals. Subjects: The first 500 randomised Dutch patients with primary rectal cancer. Main Outcome Measure(s): Local recurrence, survival, operation- related factors, specific pathological tumour characteristics, short and long term morbidity, and quality of life. Result(s): Between January 1996 and April 1998, 871 Dutch and 94 other patients were randomised. Our feasibility analysis shows that cooperation between and within the participating disciplines goes well. With regard to the surgical part, this can be confirmed by the large number of operations attended by consultant surgeons (58%). The number of abdominoperineal resections appeared to be low (30%), as did the percentage of lateral margins involved (13%). The rate of adverse effects of radiotherapy was acceptable. Apart from a larger operative blood loss and a higher infective complication rate in the irradiated group, no significant differences were found with regard to morbidity and mortality between the randomised groups.

1422,"Kennedy Space Center Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Program evaluation This program evaluation examined the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Risk Reduction Program which aims to identify CVD risk factors and reduce these risk factors through health education phone counseling. High risk participants (those having two or more elevated lipid values) are identified from monthly voluntary CVD screenings and counseled. Phone counseling consists of reviewing lab values with the participant, discussing dietary fat intake frequency using an intake questionnaire, and promoting the increase in exercise frequency. The participants are followed-up at two-months and five-months for relevant metrics including blood pressure, weight, body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, dietary fat intake, and exercise frequency. Data for three years of the KSC CVD Program included 366 participants, average age of 49 years, 75% male, and 25% female. For those with complete two and five month follow-up data, significant baseline to two-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.03); diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.002); total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary fat intake (all three at p < 0.0001) as well as a significant increase in exercise frequency (p = 0.04). Significant baseline to five-month follow-up comparisons included decreases in triglycerides (p = 0.05); and total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and dietary intake (all three at p < 0.0001).

3237,"Usefulness of dual-source computed tomography for the evaluation of coronary arteries in heart transplant recipients BACKGROUND: Heart transplant recipients require serial assessment of coronary arteries due to a risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy or atherosclerosis. Currently available non-invasive imaging methods are of a limited value for the detection of coronary stenoses, and thus invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is recommended., AIM: We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and clinical usefulness of dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) as a potential alternative to ICA for the detection of coronary stenoses., METHODS: DSCT was performed in 20 consecutive heart transplant recipients (15 males, mean age 47.5 years) who were scheduled for ICA. Exclusion criteria included renal dysfunction with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min and lack of patient consent. All examinations were performed using a first generation dual-source scanner and a retrospectively ECG-gated protocol. Data sets were routinely reconstructed in best-systolic and best-diastolic phases. We evaluated presence of a >50% stenosis in a vessel with a diameter of >1.0 mm, image quality of each segment, and radiation dose delivered to the patient. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated in per segment, per vessel, and per patient analyses, with ICA considered the reference method., RESULTS: All DSCT and ICA examinations were diagnostic and performed without any complications. Mean heart rate was 85 bpm (range 63-114), and was stable in 85% of patients. Significant stenoses (>50%) were diagnosed by DSCT in 4 of the 287 segments, and these findings were confirmed by ICA in 2 segments. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were: (1) in the per segment analysis, 100%, 99%, and 99%, respectively, for the left coronary artery; and 100% each for the right coronary artery; (2) 100%, 97%, and 97%, respectively, in the per vessel analysis; and (3) 100%, 94%, 95%, respectively, in the per patient analysis. In diastolic reconstructions, right coronary segments were significantly more commonly nondiagnostic than left coronary segments (25% vs. 11.5%, p = 0.003). In contrast, right coronary segments showed better quality than left coronary segments in systolic reconstructions (63.5% vs. 42.2%, p <0.001). Mean effective radiation dose was 12.7 (range 5.4-18.7) mSv., CONCLUSIONS: DSCT is a clinically useful alternative to invasive coronary angiography for excluding significant coronary stenoses in heart transplant recipients. The negative predictive value of this modality is very high. Sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy is acceptably high. Imaging of coronary arteries in patients with high heart rates in technically feasible, but require modifications of routine exam protocol.

684,"Facial involvement in indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and metabolic syndrome-a cross-sectional study Introduction: Face was often thought to be spared in psoriasis possibly due to the protective effect of sebum and low-dose ambient UV radiation exposure. Few have suggested that facial involvement is common and indicates disease severity. There is a paucity of data on this, particularly from India. Psoriatics have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, patients with severe disease are at greater risk. Objective(s): We decided to study the frequency, type of facial involvement in Indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and MetS. Material(s) and Method(s): 250 consecutive psoriatic patients were enrolled. Facial psoriatics were divided into peripherofacial(PF), centrofacial(CF) and mixed facial(MF) types. Disease severity was assessed using whole body, scalp, facial Psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores and Nail area psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) scores. Patients were evaluated for the presence of MetS using NCEP-III criteria. All parameters were compared both between facial and non-facial psoriatics and, between cases with different types of face involvement. Result(s): The mean age(p-0.04) and age of onset of disease(p-0.02) was lower and median whole body PASI score higher(p<0.001) in psoriatics with facial involvement than those without. No significant association was found between facial involvement and MetS. MF was the commonest type of facial involvement and there was a significant association of mixed facial involvement with increased total body PASI and head PASI scores. (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Facial involvement in psoriatics is associated with severe disease, but not metabolic syndrome. Mixed facial type might be considered a marker of overall psoriasis disease severity in the Indian population.",Excluded
1773,"Differential diagnosis of gallbladder ascariasis debris: the added value of contrast enhanced ultrasound with high frequency transducer Ascariasis debris of the gallbladder is a very rare incidental or symptomatic presentation. Ascaris debris has a pseudotumorous appearance and may be confused with neoplasia. The aim of the current retrospective study is to investigate the value of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the differential diagnosis of ascariasis debris and neoplasia of the gallbladder., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Conventional B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) and CEUS were performed for solitary echo-rich gallbladder lesions. Analysis of the CEUS enhancement pattern of the lesions was conducted according to the current EFSUMB guidelines. Two radiologists assessed the CEUS enhancement patterns in consensus. The final gold standard was surgery with histological examination or imaging follow-up., RESULTS: A total of 9 patients with final diagnoses of gallbladder ascariasis debris were included. As a control group 26 solitary hyperechoic gallbladder lesions without shadowing were included as a control group. The typical zigzag morphology with multiple echogenic parallel lines without shadow were detected inside the lumen of the gallbladder in 6 patients. After injection of 2.4 ml ultrasound contrast agents, all hyperechoic gallbladder ascariasis debris lesions showed no enhancement. All patients in the control group with similar BMUS morphology showed contrast enhancement., CONCLUSIONS: Real time visualization of contrast enhancement without radiation exposure is one of the main advantages of CEUS over other diagnostic modalities to differentiate ascariasis debris in the gallbladder from enhancing neoplasia. Thus, surgery and other interventions and their complications could be avoided.",Excluded
1272,"[Assessment of the genetic risk of radiation by irradiation data from laboratory mammals] An attempt has been made to assess quantitatively genetic risk of radiation for man based on mammalian (mostly mouse) data and using the direct method proposed by UNSCEAR. The parameter employed was induction of reciprocal translocations. Two assumptions were made: human radiosensitivity equals that of the mouse; and dose-response is linear. From observations with acute gamma irradiation the estimate of risk per 10(-2) Gy was as follows: 39 translocation heterozygotes are expected among one million F1 conceptions, 5 cases of multiple congenital anomalies, 25 abortions recorded and 49 unrecorded. Chronic gamma irradiation at dose rates of 1.3 X 10(-5), 1.7 X 10(-4) and 1.0 X 10(-4) Gy/min was 3 to 10 times less effective. Exposure to 4.2 GeV deuterons proved inferior in effectiveness to gamma irradiation. Chronic exposure to 4.1 MeV neutrons delivered at 8 X 10(-4) Gy/min showed 7 times the effectiveness of chronic gamma irradiation. Administration of tritiated water (from 37 to 37 X 10(2) kBq/g b.w.) to rats entailed a risk of the same order of magnitude as external chronic gamma irradiation. Reduction of genetic risk was achieved by pretreatment with either AFT-, ATP-serotonin mixtures or the molecular combinations, Adeturon and Cytriphos. Study of interspecies differences in genetic radiosensitivity showed decline in the following order: rat-rabbit-mouse-Syrian hamster. A dose-rate effect was most clearly seen in the rat, and least clearly in the rabbit. In female mice, examination of oocyte depletion indicated primary follicles to be highly susceptible to acute gamma irradiation; decrease in sensitivity was observed beginning with stage 4.

All patients were treated in a prone position on a bellyboard by 3DRT. The inferior border of the RT fields was at least 3-5 cm inferior to the gross tumorous volume (GTV) or at the inferior border of the obturator foramen (IBOF), whichever was more inferior. The EAS was contoured and dose distributions were determined using dose-volume histograms., RESULTS: In 53 out of 64 cases (82.8%), the EAS was completely inferior to the IBOF. In the remaining 11 cases, the EAS was either overlapping the IBOF (10 cases; 15.6%) or completely superior to the IBOF (1 case; 1.7%). The average mean dose delivered to the EAS was 2795 cGy.

The mean CAF was 39 +/- 1.0, range 30-46, for cells from normal subjects, compared to a mean of 245.6, range 101-506, for cells from hereditary RB patients (p < 10-6). Of fibroblast lines from eight patients with unilateral RB, four had a CAF comparable to that of lines from normal donors (< 60) and four had a high CAF (> 130), resembling that of hereditary forms; two of the latter four lines were from patients with familial or deletion 13 forms of RB. Furthermore, in two families, PHA-stimulated blood lymphocytes from RB patients, one bilateral and one unilateral, and from certain unaffected first-degree relatives after G2 phase X-irradiation had a high CAF (>= 110) compared to a CAF (>= 53) of cells from three normal donors sampled at the same time. These results were shown not to be related to differences in cell cycle progression or initial extent of chromatid damage. The results suggest that the high frequency of chromatid aberrations in the cells from hereditary RB patients results from a genetic deficiency in DNA repair.",Included
492,"Case-control study on radiology work, medical x-ray investigations, and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors CONTEXT: Ionizing radiation is a well-established risk factor for brain tumors. During recent years, microwave exposure from the use of cellular telephones has been discussed as a potential risk factor., OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for brain tumors., DESIGN: A case-control study, with exposure assessed by questionnaires., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 233 currently living men and women, aged 20 to 80 years, were included. The case patients had histopathologically verified brain tumors and lived in the Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-1996) or the Stockholm region (1995-1996). Two matched controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ionizing radiation and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors., RESULTS: A total of 209 cases (90%) and 425 controls (91%) answered the questionnaire. Work as a physician yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 6.00, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62 to 57.7. All three case patients had worked with fluoroscopy. Radiotherapy of the head and neck region yielded an OR of 3.61 (95% CI, 0.65-19.9). Medical diagnostic x-ray examination of the same area yielded an OR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.25-3.53), with a tumor induction period of 5 years or more. Chemical industry work yielded an OR of 4.10 (95% CI, 1.25-13.4), and laboratory work yielded an OR of 3.21 (95% CI, 1.16-8.85). Ipsilateral use of cellular telephones increased the risk for tumors in the temporal, temporoparietal, and occipital lobes (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.97-6.05), ie, the anatomic areas with highest exposure to microwaves from a mobile telephone. The result was further strengthened (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.02-6.71) in a multivariate analysis that included laboratory work and medical diagnostic x-ray investigations of the head and neck., CONCLUSION: Exposure to ionizing radiation, work in laboratories, and work in the chemical industry increased the risk of brain tumors. Use of a cellular telephone was associated with an increased risk in the anatomic area with highest exposure.",Included
1412,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere? Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included
1908,"Outcomes and toxicity following high-dose radiation therapy in 15 fractions for non-small cell lung cancer PURPOSE: Accelerated hypofractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) is increasingly used for select lung cancer patients. We evaluated clinical outcomes and predictors of pulmonary/esophageal toxicity in patients treated with >=52.5 Gy in 15 fractions., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We evaluated 229 patients treated with radiation therapy doses >=52.5 Gy in 15 fractions for non-small cell lung cancer from January 2009 through January 2016. Toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of toxicity. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and local control were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of clinical outcome were modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression., RESULTS: Median follow-up was 7 months. Forty-two patients (19%) developed grade >=2 pneumonitis, and 9 (4%) developed grade >=3 esophagitis. In multivariate analysis, age >75 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-5.25; P = .01) and percentage of lung volume receiving doses of >10 Gy higher than 32% were associated with grade >=2 pneumonitis (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.39-5.79; P = .005). On univariate analysis, esophagus mean dose >=17 Gy (OR, 10.14; 95% CI, 1.82-189.8; P = .006), gross tumor volume size >=71 cm3 (P = .002), and planning target volume size >=409 cm3 (P = .02) were associated with development of grade >=3 esophagitis. In patients with stage II/III disease (n = 73), median local control was not reached, median overall survival was 14 months, and median progression-free survival was 6 months., CONCLUSIONS: AHRT in 15 fractions can be safe and effective. Consideration for using AHRT with immunotherapy and sequential chemotherapy for improved out-of-radiation field and distant control is warranted.

570,"Accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography (CTCA) using prospective ECG-triggering for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Method(s): Thirty patients (19 male, 11 female, mean age 58.8+/-9.9 years) underwent low dose CTCA and invasive coronary angiography (CA) (median 2 days (0, 41)). Before CT scanning, intravenous beta-blocker was administered in 18/30 patients as heart rate (HR) was >65 beats per minute (bpm), achieving a mean HR of 55.7+/-7.9 bpm. CAD was defined as coronary artery narrowing >=50%, using CA as standard of reference. On an intention-to-diagnose-base all non-evaluative segments were included in the analysis. Vessels with a non-evaluative segment and no further finding were censored as false positive. Result(s): The estimated mean effective radiation dose was 2.1+/-0.7 mSv (range: 1.0 - 3.3), yielding 96.0% (383/399) of evaluable segments.

1116,"Acute effects of the electromagnetic waves emitted by mobile phones on attention in emergency physicians STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of the electromagnetic waves (EMW) emitted by mobile phones on attention in emergency physicians., METHODS: This single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blinded clinical study was performed among emergency physicians in a tertiary hospital. Thirty emergency physicians were enrolled in the study. Initial d2 test was applied in the evaluation of attention and concentration of all the physicians, who were randomly assigned into one of two groups. The control group members hold mobile phones in 'off' mode to their left ears for 15min. The members of the intervention group hold mobile phones in 'on' mode to their left ears for 15min, thus exposing them to 900-1800MHz EMW. The d2 test was re-applied to both groups after this procedure. Differences in attention and concentration levels between the groups were compared., RESULTS: Difference between initial and final d2 test in total performance (TN-E, p=0.319), in total number of figures marked (TN, p=0.177), in test performance percentile (PR, p=0.619) and in attention fluctuation (FR, p=0.083) were similar between the groups. However, difference in the number of figures missed (E1 selective attention, p=0.025), difference between numbers of incorrectly marked figures (E2, p=0,018) and difference in focus levels (E, p=0.016) were significantly in favor of the intervention group., CONCLUSION: According to our study findings, the EMW emitted by mobile phones has no deleterious effect on the attention and concentration levels of emergency physicians, and even has a positive impact on selective attention levels.

3172,"Late Effects of Head and Neck Radiotherapy on Pulp Vitality Assessed by Pulse Oximetry INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

1413,"Combining Optimized Image Processing With Dual Axis Rotational Angiography: Toward Low-Dose Invasive Coronary Angiography Background Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) reduces radiation exposure during coronary angiography on older x-ray systems. The purpose of the current study is to quantify patient and staff radiation exposure using DARCA on a modality already equipped with dose-reducing technology. Additionally, we assessed applicability of 1 dose area product to effective dose conversion factor for both DARCA and conventional coronary angiography (CCA) procedures. Methods and Results Twenty patients were examined using DARCA and were compared with 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched patients selected from a prior study using CCA on the same x-ray modality. All irradiation events are simulated using PCXMC (STUK, Finland) to determine organ and effective doses. Moreover, for DARCA each frame is simulated. Staff dose is measured using active personal dosimeters (DoseAware, Philips Healthcare, The Netherlands). With DARCA, median cumulative dose area product is reduced by 57% (ie, 7.41 versus 17.19 Gy.cm2). Effective dose conversion factors of CCA and DARCA are slightly different, yet this difference is not statistically significant. The occupational dose at physician's chest, leg, and collar level are reduced by 60%, 56%, and 16%, respectively, of which the first 2 reached statistical significance. Median effective dose is reduced from 4.75 mSv in CCA to 2.22 mSv in DARCA procedures, where the latter is further reduced to 1.79 mSv when excluding ventriculography. Conclusions During invasive coronary angiography, DARCA reduces radiation exposure even further toward low-dose values on a system already equipped with advanced image processing and noise reduction algorithms. For both DARCA and CCA procedures, using 1 effective dose conversion factor of 0.30 mSv.Gy-1.cm-2 is feasible.",Excluded

The exposed group was divided into a subgroup with 65 individuals moderately exposed (39 men and 26 women) and a highly exposed subgroup consisted of 19 men. The statistical analysis of the comet assay results showed that there were no significant differences in basal DNA damage between pesticide-exposed workers and the control group nor between moderately and highly exposed ones. In addition, exposure of peripheral blood lymphocytes to hydrogen peroxide or gamma-irradiation led to a similar degree of DNA damage and subsequent repair for all the studied populations.

2388,"Effects of a static magnetic field on audiogenic seizures in black Swiss mice Effects of a static magnetic field (SMF) with strong gradient components were studied in black Swiss mice. Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone. These findings indicate that the SMF studied here under different conditions elevated seizure threshold and had anticonvulsant properties in Black Swiss mice and increased the efficacy of a conventional anticonvulsant drug.",Excluded
1620,"Three-dimensional structures of avian beta-microseminoproteins: insight from the chicken egg-specific beta-microseminoprotein 3 paralog Beta-microseminoproteins (MSMBs) are small disulfide-rich proteins that are conserved among vertebrates. These proteins exhibit diverse biological activities and were mainly reported to play a role in male fertility, immunity, and embryogenesis. In this work, we focused on the chicken MSMB3 protein that was previously depicted as an egg antibacterial protein. We report that MSMB3 protein is exclusively expressed in the reproductive tissues of laying hens (in contrast to chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 paralogs), to be incorporated in the egg white during the process of egg formation. We also showed that chicken MSMB3 possesses highly conserved orthologs in bird species, including Neognathae and Palaeognathae. Chicken MSMB3 was purified from egg white using heparin affinity chromatography and was analyzed by top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Several proteoforms could be characterized, and a homodimer was further evidenced by NMR spectroscopy. The X-ray structure of chicken MSMB3 was solved for the first time, revealing that this protein adopts a novel dimeric arrangement. The highly cationic MSMB3 protein exhibits a distinct electrostatic distribution compared with chicken MSMB1 and MSMB2 structural models, and with published mammalian MSMB structures. The specific incorporation of MSMB3 paralog in the egg, and its phylogenetic conservation in birds together with its peculiar homodimer arrangement and physicochemical properties, suggests that the MSMB3 protein has evolved to play a critical role during the embryonic development of avian species. These new data are likely to stimulate research to elucidate the structure/function relationships of MSMB paralogs and orthologs in the animal kingdom.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Method(s): 5 polymorphic gene variants (rs1048943, rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695) were studied in 399 people living in the East Kazakhstan region in this research. 248 people of the 2nd-3rd generation lived in the territory with radiation exposure in Abai, Borodulikha areas, and 151 people the comparison group lived in Kurchum district without radiation exposure comparable in sex and age with control group. Result(s): The results show that there is a significant association of rs1048943 in exposed and unexposed groups (p < 0.003), and the absence of association of rs4646421, rs2070676, rs3813867, rs1695 in the studied groups. The mean value of thyroxine in carriers of the AG + GG genotype of rs4646421 is significantly lower than in AA genotype carriers (p = 0.04); no significant changes were found in genotypes' distribution with thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase indicators.

960,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded

Method(s): Patients undergone in the last year PCI of unprotected LMCA and scheduled for conventional X-ray coronary angiography were prospectively evaluated with stress perfusion CMR within 2 weeks before coronary angiography. Main contraindications to CMR and previous coronary artery bypass were exclusion criteria. Stress perfusion CMR was performed to follow a bolus of contrast Gadobutrol, after 3 min of adenosine infusion. Result(s): Between the 50 patients enrolled, only 1 did not finish the CMR protocol and 49 patients with median age 71 (65-75) years (38 male, 11 female) were analyzed. Previous myocardial infarction was present in 31 patients (63%) and multi vessel PCI in 39 (76%). We evaluated 784 coronary angiographic segments and found 75 stenosis or occlusions (prevalence 9.5%), but only 13 stenosis or occlusions in proximal segments (prevalence 6.6%). Patients with coronary stenosis (n=12, 24%) showed a significantly (p=0.002) higher prevalence of diabetes (7 of 12, 58%), while the other main clinical characteristics were similar to patients without coronary stenosis (all p>0.1). At CMR examination, late gadolinium enhancement was present in 25 (51%), reversible perfusion defects in 12 (24%), and fixed perfusion defects in 6 subjects (12%). The only patient with LMCA ristenosis resulted positive at perfusion CMR (Figure 1). CMR stress perfusion resulted positive in 8 of 12 patients with significant coronary lesions (sensitivity 67%, CI 35-90%) and in 4 of 5 patients with significant proximal coronary lesions (sensitivity 80%, CI 28-99). The accuracy of stress perfusion CMR in diagnosis of coronary stenosis was higher when the analysis was performed only in proximal coronary arteries (95%, CI 86-99) compared to overall vessels (84%, CI70-92). Conclusion(s): Stress perfusion CMR could strongly reduce the need for elective coronary angiography in follow up of LMCA PCI and should be validated in further multi center prospective studies.

Sixty patients who were at high risk of developing bladder tumors (BT) were divided into two groups according to whether their EP images were obtained using an NI of 9.88 (29 patients; group A) or an NI of 20 and pNRF (31 patients; group B). The CT dose index volume (CTDI(vol)) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder with respect to the anterior pelvic fat were compared in both groups. Qualitative assessment of the urinary bladder for image noise, sharpness, streak artifacts, homogeneity, and the conspicuity of polypoid or sessile-shaped BTs with a short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm was performed using a 3-point scale., RESULTS: The phantom study showed noise reduction of approximately 40% and 76% dose reduction between group A and group B. CTDI(vol) demonstrated a 73% reduction in group B (4.6 +/- 1.1 mGy) compared with group A (16.9 +/- 3.4 mGy). The CNR value was not significantly different (P = 0.60) between group A (16.1 +/- 5.1) and group B (16.6 +/- 7.6).

The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat., RESULTS: Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142 +/- 39 ml vs. 171 +/- 72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9 +/- 6.8 min vs. 34.2 +/- 14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08 +/- 0.54 Gy vs. 1.29 +/- 0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3 +/- 1.0 mrem vs. 2.6 +/- 1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8 +/- 1.1 mrem vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 mrem, p = 0.01). Fewer patients underwent ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the radial group (37.5% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.28) and radial PCI procedures were less complex.

1644,"Potential Irish dose reference levels for cardiac interventional examinations Collective dose for cardio-angiography studies is the highest of all non-CT radiological investigations. Deterministic effects such as erythema, epilation and ulceration being reported on patients who have undergone these procedures emphasise the importance of optimising radiation dose, whilst not compromising diagnostic efficacy. This study investigated radiation doses delivered to patients for four common types of cardiac radiological examinations: coronary angiography (CA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary angiograms (which were followed by an interventional procedure (CA-PCI)) and permanent pacemaker insertions (PPIs). 21 cardiac imaging suites participated in the study in 14 hospitals, representing 90% of relevant centres within Ireland. Radiation dose was monitored for 1804 adult patients using dose-area product meters. Operational and examination details, such as cardiologist grade, patient details, examination complexity and exposure factors, were recorded for each examination. Variation factors in dose between centres ranged from 2.7 to 11.1, but these factors were not higher than intrahospital variations previously recorded for other examinations within Ireland, such as chest X-ray. High-dose centres were often associated with long screening times, a high patient body mass index and complexity of the procedure. Preliminary dose reference levels (DRLs) were established using rounded third quartile values at 4200 cGy cm(2), 8400 cGy cm(2), 10,700 cGy cm(2) and 2100 cGy cm(2) for CA, PCI, CA-PCI and PPI, respectively.

METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULT(S): Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p<0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p<0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION(S): The LDCT with spectral shaping and ADMIRE3 provided acceptable image quality in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, with significantly reduced radiation dose and motion artifacts.",Excluded
704,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.",Included
1575,"Optimal timing for salvage surgery after definitive radiotherapy in hypopharyngeal cancer Purpose: Use of radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy is increasing in hypopharyngeal cancer. However, many show residual tumor after radiotherapy. Timing for treatment evaluation and salvage therapy is essential. However, optimal timing for salvage surgery has not been suggested. In this study, we tried to evaluate optimal timing for salvage surgery. Methods and Materials: Patients who were diagnosed with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma between 2006 and 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Response of all treated patients were analyzed at 1, 3, and 6 months after radiotherapy. Any patients with progression before 6 months were excluded. Result(s): A total of 54 patients were analyzed. Complete remission (CR) rates at 1 month (CR1), 3 months (CR3) and 6 months (CR6) were 66.7%, 81.5%, and 90.7%, respectively. Non-CR at 1 month (NCR1), 3 months (NCR3), and 6 months (NCR6) showed poor locoregional recurrence-free survival rates (1-year rates of 63.7%, 66.7%, and 0.0%, respectively) compared to CR1, CR3, and CR6 (1-year rates 94.3%, 88.0%, and 91.5%, respectively). Particularly significant differences were seen between CR6 and NCR6 (p < 0.001). Of 10 patients with NCR3, 5 showed CR at 6 months (NCR3/CR6). There was no statistical difference in locoregional recurrence-free survival between CR3 and NCR3/CR6 group (p = 0.990). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest half of patients who did not show CR at 3 months eventually achieved CR at 6 months. Waiting until 6 months after radiotherapy may be appropriate for avoiding additional salvage therapy.Copyright © 2018. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
3003,"Next-generation sequencing analysis of circulating micro-RNA expression in response to parabolic flight as a spaceflight analogue Understanding physiologic reactions to weightlessness is an indispensable requirement for safe human space missions. This study aims to analyse changes in the expression of circulating miRNAs following exposure to gravitational changes. Eight healthy volunteers (age: 24.5 years, male: 4, female: 4) were included. Each subject underwent 31 short-term phases of weightlessness and hypergravity induced by parabolic flight as a spaceflight analogue. At baseline, 1 and 24 h after parabolic flight, venous blood was withdrawn. Analysis of circulating miRNAs in serum was conducted by means of next generation sequencing. In total, 213 miRNAs were robustly detected (TPM > 5) by small RNA sequencing in all 24 samples. Four miRNAs evidenced a significant change in expression after adjusting for multiple testing. Only miR-223-3p showed a consistent significant decrease 24 h after parabolic flight compared to baseline values and values at 1 h after parabolic flight. miR-941 and miR-24-3p showed a significant decrease 24 h after parabolic flight compared to 1 h after parabolic flight but not to baseline values. miR-486-5p showed a significant increase 24 h after parabolic flight compared to 1 h after parabolic flight but not to baseline values. A target network analysis identified genes of the p53 signaling pathway and the cell cycle highly enriched among the targets of the four microRNAs. Our findings suggest cellular adaption to gravitational changes at the post-transcriptional level. Based on our results, we suggest a change in cell cycle regulation as potential explanation for adaptational changes observed in space missions. 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
876,"A questionnaire study to derive information on the working environment, clinical training, use of ancillary staff and optimization of patient radiation dose within UK dental practice Aim To evaluate the working environment of GDPs and Endodontists and the methods used to optimize patient radiation dose. Methodology A total of 857 GDPs and 170 specialist Endodontists were contacted. The responders, 603 of the former and 132 of the latter, completed a questionnaire covering practitioner demographics, pattern of practice, the use of radiographic techniques and the optimization of dose. Chi-squared tests were used to compare groups at the P=0.05 level of significance. For nonparametric data, the Mann-Whitney U-test was employed. Results A response rate of 73% was achieved. Overall, 79.5% of endodontic specialists used film holders compared with 65.9% of GDPs (P=0.001). One hundred and thirty (98.5%) endodontists and 581 (96.3%) GDPs reported that they were well prepared or adequately prepared in radiographically assessing the presence of apical pathosis. The study found significant differences (P<0.001) between the use of digital radiography by specialist endodontists 93 (70.5%) compared with general dental practitioners 167 (27.7%). Significant differences (P=0.004) were also observed in the use of rectangular collimation between endodontic specialists 55 (42%) and GDPs 223 (37%). With regard to the use of film holders in diagnostic radiography, 105 (79.5%) of endodontic specialists employed these devices compared with 396 (65.7%) GDPs; this finding was significant (P=0.005). For working length estimation, significant differences (P=0.001) were noted in the use of a film holder between endodontic specialists 105 (79.5%) and GDPs 386 (64%).

864,"Preoperative CT angiography of prospective renal transplant recipients: Evaluation of safety of iso-osmolar nonionic intravascular contrast, imaging findings, and effects on management in a predialysis patient cohort Objective: Prospective renal transplant recipients with matched living donors require careful preoperative evaluation as a result of increased risk for aortoiliac atherosclerosis and venous thrombosis in addition to an increased incidence of renal carcinoma. We investigated the safety of CT angiography (CTA) in a predialysis cohort for evaluation of arterial and venous disease and other pathology that would alter management. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed the records of 40 potential renal transplant recipients (24 men and 16 women; age range, 23-79 years) who were investigated with CTA performed on 64-row MDCT scanners after 100 mL Iodixanol 320 (Visipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) IV contrast enhancement. Nonenhanced, arterial, and 2- minute delayed phase thin section (0.625-mm collimation) imaging was performed with 2-mm axial and multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering angiographic reconstructions. Pre- and post-CTA serum creatinine (Se Cr) levels were obtained and clinical status observed to time of transplant or up to 7 months post- CTA. Patients underwent pre- and post-CTA hydration as allowed by individual renal status. Result(s): All patients had diagnostic quality CTA studies. Sixteen patients (40%) had major aortoiliac arterial disease that influenced transplantation management or required additional therapy. Eight patients had renal tumors, polycystic kidneys, or other tumors requiring surgical therapy. CTA necessitated additional imaging tests in seven others. Mean pre- and posttransplant Se Cr were 5.2 (range, 2.9-14.1) and 5.1 (range, 2.4-14.2) respectively. Twenty-seven patients had stable or mean decreased Se Cr of 10.2% and 13 had mean increase of 6.3% (range, +/- 32%) post-CTA. No patient required dialysis as a result of CTA. Conclusion(s): CTA with a moderate dose of Iodixanol contrast is a safe and effective procedure with no major clinical impact on renal function in this predialysis population. CTA provided arterial and venous road maps and influenced transplantation management in 40%. Other important findings led to additional surgery in 22% of the group.",Excluded
2541,"Detection of unwarranted CT radiation exposure from patient and imaging protocol meta-data using regularized regression Background: Variability in radiation exposure from CT scans can be appropriate and driven by patient features such as body habitus. Quantitative analysis may be performed to discover instances of unwarranted radiation exposure and to reduce the probability of such occurrences in future patient visits. No universal process to perform identification of outliers is widely available, and access to expertise and resources is variable. Objective(s): The goal of this study is to develop an automated outlier detection procedure to identify all scans with an unanticipated high radiation exposure, given the characteristics of the patient and the type of the exam. Material(s) and Method(s): This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective cohort study was conducted from June 30, 2012 - December 31, 2013 in a quaternary academic medical center. The de-identified dataset contained 28 fields for 189,959 CT exams. We applied the variable selection method Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select important variables for predicting CT radiation dose. We then employed a regression approach that is robust to outliers, to learn from data a predictive model of CT radiation doses given important variables identified by LASSO. Patient visits whose predicted radiation dose was statistically different from the radiation dose actually received were identified as outliers. Result(s): Our methodology identified 1% of CT exams as outliers. The top-5 predictors discovered by LASSO and strongly correlated with radiation dose were Tube Current, kVp, Weight, Width of collimator, and Reference milliampere-seconds. A human expert validation of the outlier detection algorithm has yielded specificity of 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92]and sensitivity of 0.91 [95% CI 0.85-0.97](PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.92). These values substantially outperform alternative methods we tested (F1 score 0.88 for our method against 0.51 for the alternatives). Conclusion(s): The study developed and tested a novel, automated method for processing CT scanner meta-data to identify CT exams where patients received an unwarranted amount of radiation. Radiation safety and protocol review committees may use this technique to uncover systemic issues and reduce future incidents.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded
2595,"Delivered dose and vascular response after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis: retrospective dosimetry and volumetric intravascular ultrasound analysis BACKGROUND: Observations from previous intracoronary radiation therapy trials noted a considerable discrepancy between the prescribed radiation dose and the dose actually delivered. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of actual delivered dose on vascular changes and to test the appropriateness of the current dose prescription., METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis was performed in 30 in-stent restenosis cases treated with a 40-mm (90)Sr/Y source train. The fixed dose was prescribed at 2 mm from the centerline of the source train (18.4 Gy at 2 mm for reference diameter or =3.36 mm). Only stent segments with full radiation coverage and device injury were enrolled and divided into 2-mm-long subsegments (n=202). D(S90)EEM (the minimum dose absorbed by 90% of the external elastic membrane surface) was calculated as the delivered dose corresponding to each segment, assuming that the radiation catheter occupied the same position in the vessel as the IVUS catheter. Mean D(S90)EEM of 23.5+/-5.82 Gy (range 12.3 to 41.7 Gy) was delivered to these subsegments. Overall, intimal hyperplasia volume remained constant from postintervention to follow-up (2.23+/-1.10 to 2.32+/-1.09 mm3/m; P=NS). Regression analysis revealed there was no correlation between delivered dose intensity and changes in intimal hyperplasia volume. No particular dose-dependent complications were appreciated in this delivered dose range., CONCLUSIONS: The current dose-prescription protocol of (90)Sr/Y radiation to native in-stent restenosis lesions may provide substantial inhibition of neointimal reproliferation regardless of the actual delivered dose intensity.",Excluded

This study aims to evaluate their association with arthritis features and hand MRI abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHOD(S): Fifty SLE patients, with a mean (SD) age of 48.1 (14.6) years were tested for MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels, then further classified according to the presence of X-Ray erosions and joint deformities. Eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 47.9 (11.8) and 14 healthy people aged 46.0 (11.0) were enrolled as control groups. A subgroup of 28 SLE patients underwent a dominant-hand MRI; the detected changes were classified and semiquantitatively scored as capsular swelling, synovitis, edematous or proliferative tenosynovitis, bone oedema, bone erosions. Statistical analysis was performed using multiple regression models. RESULT(S): MMP-3 were significantly higher in patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy (JA) (22.1ng/ml, p< 0.05) and independently associated with hsCRP serum levels (B-coeff 0.50; r=0.30; p< 0.05). MMP-12 serum levels were significantly lower in patients with JA (0.18ng/ml, p< 0.05) and inversely associated with the prednisone daily dose (B-coeff -0.03; r= -0.44; p< 0.01).

Forty patients with refractory DLBCL were treated with high-dose etoposide for stem cell mobilization. All patients were in progressive disease (PD) prior to mobilization and underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by APBSCT. Successful PBSC mobilization was achieved in all patients. Twenty-three patients (57.5%) showed a clinical response to high-dose etoposide. After APBSCT, 17 patients (42.5%) achieved CR.

1904,"Risk of cancer associated with low-dose radiation exposure: comparison of results between the INWORKS nuclear workers study and the A-bomb survivors study The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS. These findings from different study populations may help understanding of radiation risks, with INWORKS contributing information derived from cohorts of workers with protracted low dose-rate exposures.",Included
2459,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included

189,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included
2472,"High dose rate brachytherapy in the management of lung transplant airway stenosis BACKGROUND: Airway complications after lung transplantation remain a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Interventional bronchoscopic management continues to be the main modality in the management of these problems., METHODS: Four patients with airway stenoses after lung transplantation received high dose rate brachytherapy for management of recurrent stenosis. All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction. The radiation dose for all 4 patients was 3 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the center of the catheter., RESULTS: All four patients have had routine follow-up after endobronchial brachytherapy treatments. Of the 4 patients, 2 treated with this modality showed a significant response to therapy in that the bronchus remained free of obstruction after treatment; 1 patient had partial improvement, and 1 patient failed to show significant improvement and expired from the sequelae of persistent airway obstruction., CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial brachytherapy can be an effective modality for managing recurrent stenoses caused by hyperplastic granulation tissue at the bronchial anastomosis. The optimal timing and ideal candidate for intraluminal radiation therapy for this problem remains a challenge and warrants further investigation.",Excluded
254,"Long-term outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas at the BC cancer agency Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis.

In multivariable models, adjusted for disease laterality, survivors diagnosed at <1 year of age performed significantly better on measures of short-term verbal memory (beta=0.87, P<.01), long-term verbal memory (beta=0.66, P=.02), verbal learning (beta = 0.67, P=.02), and verbal reasoning abilities (beta = 0.79, P<.01) compared with survivors diagnosed at <=1 year of age. In multivariable models, restricted to bilateral survivors and adjusted for age at diagnosis, whole brain radiation exposure was significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of short-term verbal memory (beta=-0.003, P = .03) and long-term verbal memory (beta = 20.003, P = .01). Reported social attainment was consistent with adult developmental expectations. CONCLUSION(S): Adult survivors of retinoblastoma demonstrate few cognitive or social attainment deficits decades following diagnosis and treatment. Findings suggest the potential for neural reorganization following early insult to the visual system as well as vulnerability of the developing brain to low dose radiation exposure. Early intervention and rehabilitation will be important for these patients.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
1687,"[Local recurrence of rectal cancers. Multidimensional analysis by anatomoclinical factors and role of irradiation] Pre- or postoperative radiation therapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal carcinoma. Factors related to local recurrence were analyzed retrospectively by uni- and multivariate analysis. One hundred and fifty-five patients (mean age: 65 years) were operated on with curative intent between 1967 and 1984. Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

2244,"Creating percutaneous radiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist Background: The first arteriovenous fistulas were created at the wrist more than 60 years ago. Basic surgical construction techniques remain unchanged with mobilization and repositioning of the vessels followed by a sutured anastomosis. We used the Ellipsys device to construct percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas at the wrist and report the results. Method(s): Data were reviewed retrospectively for all patients who had a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula created during a 6-month period. Each individual underwent ultrasound vessel mapping in addition to physical examination. When a radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was feasible and a communicating vein 2 mm in diameter was noted in the distal forearm along with a radial artery 2 mm, a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula was considered and reviewed with the patient. Result(s): Four individuals met the criteria to consider a percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistula and all elected to have the procedure performed. Ages were 54-85 years. Three were diabetic and one was female. All percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas were technically successful. Two individuals had not yet started dialysis therapy. Successful and repetitive cannulation for the two individuals with catheters was initiated at 4 and 8 weeks post procedure. The two pre-dialysis patients had physiologic arteriovenous fistula maturation (6 mm vein diameter and >500 mL/min flow) at 4 and 12 weeks. There were no procedural or late complications and none required intervention. Follow-up was 8-23 months (mean 16 months). Conclusion(s): The success of these percutaneous radiocephalic-arteriovenous fistulas suggests that use of the Ellipsys device will be applicable at the wrist in selected patients where appropriate vessel sizes and configurations are found.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
877,"Gamma radiation tolerance in different life stages of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster PURPOSE: Insects are known to have higher levels of radiation tolerance than mammals. The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included
582,"Treatment and improvement of the breeding system of the albumin-deficient and jaundiced strain of rats The AJR (alb/alb, j/j) strain is semi-lethal and the rats die at about two weeks of age. Cross breeding with a pari of ACJ (alb/alb, j/+) is required for maintenance and production. We studied the treatment of AJRs for improvement of the breeding system. AJRs with jaundice on the skin at about 7 days of age were intraperitoneally administered 1 ml/rat of normal rat serum every few days and irradiated with visible light for 14 hours a day in an irradiation box. This treatment allowed us to obtain mature AJRs. The treatment was effective when applied for short periods of 1-4 weeks of age. The frequency of maturation of the treated AJRs was about 27% and the best mating combination was a female ACJ and male AJR. The treatment of AJRs, made the progeny test for the selection of ACJs for breeding pairs of ACJ X ACR unnecessary and increased the frequency of appearance of AJRs to 50%.",Excluded
2340,"Demonstration of Human Fetal Bone Morphology with MR Imaging: A Preliminary Study PURPOSE: CT is a useful modality for the evaluation of fetal skeletal dysplasia but radiation exposure is unavoidable. The purpose of this study is to compare the usefulness of MRI and CT for evaluating the fetal skeletal shape., METHODS: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Fetal specimens (n = 14) were scanned on a 3T MRI scanner using our newly-developed sequence. It is based on T2*-weighted imaging (TR, 12 ms; TE for opposed-phase imaging, 6.1 ms, for in-phase imaging, 7.3 ms; flip angle, 40degree). The specimens were also scanned on a 320 detector-row CT scanner. Four radiologists visually graded and compared the visibility of the bone shape of eight regions on MRI- and CT-scans using a 5-point grading system., RESULTS: The diagnostic ability of MRI with respect to the 5th metacarpals, femur, fibula, and pelvis was superior to CT (all, P < 0.050); there was no significant difference in the evaluation results of observers with respect to the cervical and lumbar spine, and the 5th metatarsal (0.058 <= P <= 1.000). However, the diagnostic ability of MRI was significantly inferior to CT for the assessment of the bone shape of the thoracic spine (observers A and C: P = 0.002, observers B and D: P = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The MRI method we developed represents a potential alternative to CT imaging for the evaluation of the fetal bone structure.",Excluded
2194,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012 In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included
72,"Effect of oral administration of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin erythema and pigmentation induced by UVB, UVA, visible light and solar simulated radiation Hypericin from St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a photosensitizing agent that may cause a severe photodermatitis when higher amounts of St John's wort are ingested by animals. Although Hypericum extracts are widely used in the treatment of depressive disorders, only a little information on the photosensitizing capacity of St John's wort in humans is available. In the present prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of the Hypericum extract LI 160 on skin sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA), visible light (VIS) and solar simulated radiation (SIM). Seventy two volunteers of skin types II and III were included and were divided into six groups, each consisting of 12 volunteers. In the single-dose study the volunteers (n = 48) received 6 or 12 coated tablets (5400 or 10800 mug hypericin). In the steady-state study the volunteers (n = 24) received an initial dose of 6 tablets (5400 mug hypericin), and subsequently 3 x 1 tablets (2700 mug hypericin) per day for 7 days. Phototesting was performed on the volar forearms prior to medication and 6 h after the last administration of Hypericum extract. The erythema-index and melanin-index were evaluated photometrically using a mexameter. After both single-dose and steady-state administration, no significant influence on the erythema-index or melanin-index could be detected, with the exception of a marginal influence on UVB induced pigmentation (p = 0.0471) in the single-dose study. The results do not provide evidence for a phototoxic potential of the Hypericum extract LI 160 in humans when administered orally in typical clinical doses up to 1800 mg daily. This is in accordance with previous pharmacokinetics studies that found hypericin serum and skin levels after oral ingestion of Hypericum extract always to be lower than the assumed phototoxic hypericin threshold level of 1000 ng/mL.

1293,"Influence of topography on the endemicity of Kala-azar: a study based on remote sensing and geographical information system Kala-azar, a fatal infectious disease in many Indian states, particularly in Bihar, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and Jharkhand, is caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani and transmitted by the sandfly vector Phlebotomus argentipes. The vector is distributed all over the country but the disease is confined to particular zones since before the last century. In this study, parameters such as altitude, temperature, humidity, rainfall and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were investigated for correlation with the distribution of the disease in the northeastern corner of the Indian sub-continent. Data analysis on Kala-azar prevalence during the period 2005-2007 in the four states showed that the highest prevalence was below 150 m of altitude with very few cases located above the 300 m level. Low NDVI value ranges (0.03-0.015) correlated with a high occurrence of the disease. The maximum temperatures in the affected sites varied between an upper level of 25-29 degrees C and a minimum of 16-20 degrees C. The rainfall in these areas fluctuated between 1154 and 1834 mm. As the disease showed a high correlation with the prevailing topographic conditions, an attempt was made to improve the relative strength of the approach to predict the potential for endemicity of leishmaniasis by introducing satellite imagery complemented with a geographical information system database.",Excluded
3342,"Intra-abdominal pressure effects on porcine thoracic compliance in weightlessness: implications for physiologic tolerance of laparoscopic surgery in space OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic surgery (LS) is envisioned as an option for spaceflight, but requires intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) to create the surgical domain. Prolonged weightlessness induces physiologic deconditioning that questions the ability of ill or injured astronauts to tolerate IAH. On earth, IAH results in marked ventilatory embarrassment. As there has been no previous study of physiologic changes related to LS in weightlessness, we studied anesthetized pigs in parabolic flight., DESIGN: Parabolic flight research laboratory., SUBJECTS: Five anesthetized Yorkshire pigs., INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were transported from an animal care facility and secured aboard an aircraft capable of generating hypergravity and weightlessness. Mechanical ventilation was performed using pressure control and positive end-expiratory pressure at 15 and 2 cm H2O, respectively; rate 12 breaths/min. Three abdominal conditions were used during LS: insufflation to produce IAH, abdominal wall retraction (AWR), and no abdominal wall manipulation (baseline). During each parabola breath by breath-tidal volumes (Vt) were recorded by a transport ventilator (HT-50 Newport Medical)., MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Least square means (LS-means) of weight corrected Vt (milliliter per kilogram) by gravity (g) and abdominal condition were determined using a mixed effects model for repeated measures analysis. Increasing gravity (g) consistently reduced Vt (p = 0.0011) as did insufflation (p < 0.0001). In 1g, Vt (LS-mean 13.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.4-15.0) was relatively unaffected by AWR (LS-mean 12.8, 95% CI: 11.5-14.00), but markedly decreased by IAH (LS-mean 10.00, 95% CI: 8.9-11.1), an effect accentuated in hypergravity (LS-mean 8.1, 95% CI: 6.4-9.8). In weightlessness, Vt reduction during insufflation was near obviated (LS-mean 12.3, 95% CI: 10.6-14.1), and AWR regularly but inconsistently increased the Vt above 1g baseline (LS-mean 13.7, 95% CI: 11.7-15.8)., CONCLUSIONS: Weightlessness protects against thoracic compliance changes that are inherent in IAH during induced pneumoperitoneum in gravity. The technique-related physiologic cost of performing LS in space deconditioned astronauts should be incorporated into design concepts for space surgery systems.",Excluded
1347,"[UV risk perception by the general public: results of a representative questionnaire in Germany] For public health promotion purposes it is important to know how the general public perceives the risk factor ""UV exposure"" and how UV risk perception is connected to health-related attitudes and beliefs. The aim of the study was to collect representative data about UV risk perception in Germany. A representative telephone survey using the ADM design was carried out among 1 501 German residents between May and July 2007. Variables related to UV risk knowledge, relevance of risk topics in every-day thinking and risk estimates were investigated. Data regarding a subjective benefit evaluation of UV exposition was also collected. The results suggest no essential gaps in the general knowledge about UV risks, except for the underestimation of UV-related cataracts. The respondents thought it extremely likely that UV exposure would cause health damage such as skin cancer, photoaging or sun burns. People were asked to report how often they had thought about a number of health risks including UV risks in the last two weeks. It was established that UV risks are present but not dominant in people's every-day thinking. Along with it, the risk evaluation proves to be rather moderate. The mean value for respondents' perceived personal risk is M=5.1, in the midsection of the given 10-point scale. The results show that perceived personal risk is not influenced by the serious UV health risks such as cancer or cataracts. The results also indicate that UV benefit and UV risk perception are not strongly related to one another. In summary, participants' perception and assessment of the various health risks of UV exposure seem to be realistic, but the UV risk assessment it is not related to the perception of personal risk. One must therefore assume that UV health risk information and education campaigns do not necessarily lead to a change in the perception of personal UV risk. Rather than addressing primarily risk knowledge, UV risk communication should focus more on motivational aspects and consider the role of UV benefit perception. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

1593,"Preoperative intensified radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer: Experience of a single institution Purpose: The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of an intensified neoadjuvant protocol with the addition of weekly oxaliplatin in the preoperative strategy of rectal cancer treatment. Patients and Methods: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received continous infusion 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) 200 mg/m2/day in combination with weekly oxaliplatin at a dose of 50 mg/m2. Doses of radiotherapy were 45 Gy to the whole pelvis plus 5.4-9 Gy to the tumour mass. The primary end-points of the study were evaluation of toxicity, compliance with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, downstaging, pathological complete response (pCR) and the rate of sphincter preservation for distal cancers. Secondary end-points were relapse-free and overall survival. Result(s): From November 2006 to June 2009, 51 patients were enrolled into the study. Compliance with chemotherapy was 80%. The incidence of G3 diarrhoea and proctitis were 17.6% and 21.5%, respectively. Surgery was performed in 48 patients with 100% R0 resection. 76.4% of low-lying tumours underwent conservative treatment. Seventy-nine percent of patients were downstaged: T and N downstaging were observed in 71% and 75% of patients, respectively. A pCR was obtained in 11 (22.9%) patients. Conclusion(s): Intensification of neoadjuvant treatment for rectal cancer with the addition of weekly oxaliplatin is feasible, with remarkable rates of downstaging and pathological complete response. Data on sphincter preservation for distal cancers were excellent. Phase III trials with a longer follow-up will establish whether this good outcome in terms of surrogate end-points will translate into better rates of disease-free and overall survival. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2976,"Removal of Antiscatter Grids for Spinal Digital Subtraction Angiography: Dose Reduction without Loss of Diagnostic Value Background Spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) exposes patients and operators to substantial amounts of radiation. Antiscatter grid (ASG) removal is used to decrease radiation exposure but may reduce image quality. Purpose To determine whether ASG removal during spinal DSA in adults reduces radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality and whether dose reduction is related to body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study included adults undergoing spinal DSA between January and December 2016. Each procedure included an additional angiographic acquisition performed twice, once with and once without ASG, either documenting the artery of Adamkiewicz (no pathology group) or the condition leading to the procedure (pathology group). Dose differences between study acquisitions and the influence of BMI were evaluated via paired t test. Two neurointerventionalists blinded to acquisition protocols were asked to independently evaluate a sample of 40 study acquisitions (20 with ASG, 20 without ASG) from 20 randomly selected participants to (a) rate image quality, (b) categorize findings, and (c) determine whether images had been obtained with or without ASG. Percentage agreement on image quality, findings categorization, and ability to correctly identify the acquisition protocol was calculated for both readers. Results Fifty-three participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 51 years +/- 15.2; 32 men) were evaluated. ASG removal reduced the mean dose per acquisition by approximately 33% (mean dose-area product and air kerma decreased from 202 to 135.6 microGy/m2 and from 35.3 to 24 mGy, respectively; P < .001) independently of BMI (P = .3). Both readers evaluated all images (40 of 40) as being of diagnostic quality and correctly categorized findings in 19 of 20 (95%) cases. Overall percentage agreement for correct protocol identification was 60% (12 of 20) for grid-in and 45% (nine of 20) for grid-out images. Conclusion Antiscatter grid removal during spinal digital subtraction angiography decreased participants' radiation exposure while preserving diagnostic image quality. © RSNA, 2020.",Excluded

Methods In accordance with the RTOG scoring criteria, ninety-two patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy were evaluated for acute ROM which was defined as severe when the score >=3. Patients' medical records and dosimetric data exported from IMRT plan enable the authors to perform a statistical analysis for the parameters as potential predictors of severe ROM. Results Body weight loss and V30 Gy (p = 0.017 and 0.003, respectively) are related factors to severe ROM. As the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve shows, the threshold value of V30 for severe ROM was 73.155% (sensitivity, 0.842; specificity, 0.671), and the area under V30 Gy curves was 0.753 (p = 0.001).

1284,"Intraoperative Gamma Probe Localization of the Ureters: A Novel Concept Background: Ureteral stent placement to localize the ureters during operations is an invasive procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using the gamma probe to intraoperatively identify the ureters after intravenous injection of a radiopharmaceutical agent. Study Design: Ten patients undergoing elective abdominal operations were prospectively enrolled in this study. An average dose of 4.5 mCi (range 2.8 to 5.3 mCi) of technetium Tc 99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) was administered intravenously before localization of the ureters. The gamma probe was used to localize the ureters. Correct identification of the ureters was confirmed when gentle manipulation induced a typical ureteral peristaltic pattern. Result(s): Gamma counts were significantly elevated in all ureters examined. Compared with background counts, gamma counts were increased over the ureter in all patients, with an average increase of 465%. The technique was modified after use in the first 3 patients and standardized for patients 4 through 10. Data from those seven patients were analyzed. Both ureters were correctly identified using the gamma probe at a mean of 15 minutes (median, 10 minutes) after a single 99mTc-DTPA injection (range 4 to 41 minutes). The mean background count was 80 counts per second (cps, range 50 to 130 cps). The mean ureter count was 393 cps (range 128 to 700 cps). The average percent increase of each ureter count compared with its specific background count was 465% (range 256% to 1,077%). The difference was statistically significant for all values (p < 0.001).

1671,"Targeted use of endoscopic CO2 laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for improving swallowing function following head and neck cancer treatment BACKGROUND: Cricopharyngeal dysfunction following head and neck cancer treatment may lead to a significant reduction in oral intake. Carbon dioxide laser is an established procedure for the treatment of non-malignant cricopharyngeal disorders. We report our experience of laser cricopharyngeal myotomy with objective swallowing outcome measures, before and after treatment., METHODS: We identified 11 patients who had undergone carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy for dysphagia following radiotherapy, with or without chemotheraphy between January 2006 and July 2011. We analysed the swallowing outcomes following carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy by retrospective grading of pre- and post-procedure videofluoroscopic swallowing study of liquids, using the validated Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile., RESULTS: The median Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile score was 13 pre-myotomy and 10 post-myotomy. This difference between scores was non-significant (p = 0.41). The median, cricopharyngeal-specific Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile variables (14 and 17) improved from 3 to 2, but were similarly non-significant (p = 0.16). We observed the improved Modified Barium Swallow Impairment Profile scores post-procedure in the majority of patients., CONCLUSION: Endoscopic carbon dioxide laser cricopharyngeal myotomy remains a viable option in treatment-related cricopharyngeal dysfunction; its targeted role requires further prospective study.

We retrospectively analyzed 232 patients with Stage T1-3 N0-3 M0 NPC who underwent definitive IMRT with or without additional ICBT boost between 2002 and 2013. For most of the 124 patients who had ICBT boost, the additional brachytherapy was given as 6 Gy in 2 fractions completed within 1 week after IMRT of 70 Gy. CCRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy was used for 176 patients, including 88 with and 88 without ICBT boost, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 63.1 months. The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 81.5% and 91.5%, respectively. ICBT was not associated with local control prediction (P = 0.228). However, in a subgroup analysis, 75 T1 patients with ICBT boost had significantly better local control than the other 71 T1 patients without ICBT boost (98.1% vs 85.9%, P = 0.020), despite having fewer patients who had undergone chemotherapy (60.0% vs 76.1%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that both ICBT (P = 0.029) and chemotherapy (P = 0.047) influenced local control for T1 patients. Our study demonstrated that dose escalation with ICBT can improve local control of the primary tumor for NPC patients with T1 disease treated with IMRT, even without chemotherapy.

2529,"Proton beam therapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Practice patterns, outcomes, and the effect of biologically effective dose escalation Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) generally are safe and effective for non-operative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, data comparing the two modalities are limited. We aimed to identify the practice patterns and outcomes of nonsurgical HCC cases treated definitively with either SBRT or PBT. Method(s): We queried the National Cancer Database for T1-2N0 HCC patients receiving PBT or SBRT from 2004 to 2015. Patients were excluded for any treatment other than non-palliative external beam radiotherapy. A multivariable binomial regression model identified patterns of SBRT/PBT use, and propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression assessed correlates of survival. Result(s): A total of 71 patients received PBT and 918 patients received SBRT (median follow-up 45 months). SBRT was used in 1.8% of nonoperative early stage HCC cases in 2004 and 4.2% of cases in 2015, whereas PBT was used in 0.1-0.2% of cases every year. The median biologically effective dose (BED) for SBRT and PBT was 100 Gy10 and 98 Gy10, respectively (OR =0.70, P=0.17). Factors predictive of receiving PBT included: white race, higher comorbidity score, higher education, metropolitan residence, tumors >5 cm and recent treatment (all P<0.05). Both PBT (HR =0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78) and BED >=100 Gy10 (HR =0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) were independent predictors for longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although not implying causation and requiring prospective corroboration, PBT was independently associated with longer survival than SBRT, despite being delivered to HCC patients with multiple poor prognostic factors. PBT may also allow for safer BED escalation, which also independently associated with outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded

The RV PVLs were of high quality and reproducible., CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof of concept of the feasibility of generating RV PVL; the short half-life (10 minutes) and low energy (59 keV) of Ta-178 allow the generation of multiple loops at low radiation exposure. Such studies could be performed at the bedside and provide a wealth of information that may have clinical and research merits.",Excluded
2295,"Cardiac computed tomography previous to atrial fibrillation ablation - effects of technological improvements and protocol optimization BACKGROUND: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) can provide a precise tridimentional anatomic map and exclude intra-cardiac thrombus. We aimed to access the impact of CT protocol optimization and technological evolution on the contrast and radiation dose as well as on image quality previous to atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation., METHODS: From a prospective registry of consecutive patients who underwent cardiac CT in a single center, we selected 270 patients in whom the CT was done for evaluation prior to AF ablation and they were distributed in 3 groups: Group1: the first 150 patients included; Group2: the last 60 patients performed with the same CT scanner; Group3: the first 60 exams performed with the new CT scanner. Quality of the protocol was access based on radiation dose, contrast volume used, the use of a second (delayed) acquisition, and on quantitative image quality analisis (signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios; density homogeneity racio between LA and LAA)., RESULTS: We found a significant radiation dose as well as contrast dose reduction between the first and last subgroups (G1: 5,6mSv and 100ml; G2: 1,3mSv and 90ml; G3: 0,6mSv and 65ml). Even though group 3 had less radiation and contrast used it still had better quantitative image quality (signal/noise of 13,5; contrast/noise 14,8; density homogeneity racio of 0,92)., CONCLUSION: Protocol optimization and technology both contributed to significant lower radiation dose and contrast volume used on cardiac CTs prior to AF ablation, without compromising image quality.

1956,"Resource use in intensive care unit: A cost analysis in surgical intensive care medicine Background: Since 2004 surgical procedures done in German hospitals have been paid for by a flat-rate reimbursement scheme based on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). The aim of the present detailed cost analysis study was to identify the major factors that determine the costs of intensive care medicine. Method(s): In a patient-based investigation lasting 6 months, 104 patients (mean age 64.6 years) on an interdisciplinary surgical intensive care unit were analyzed over 309 hospital occupancy days. Demographic data, drugs administered, infusions, nutrition, blood and coagulation products, invasive measures and monitoring, artificial respiration parameters, other measures and diagnostic services (laboratory, microbiology, x-ray, etc.), as well as four intensive scores (SAPS II, APACHE II, SOFA, TISS 28) were recorded daily. Result(s): The overall cost of 309 occupancy days (n=104) amounted to 457,564.11 euros, the average cost per day being 1,480.78 euros, and the mean case-specific cost 4,747.48 euros. 49 % of the overall cost was generated by medical staff, with medication and material each accounting for 18 %. Of the personnel costs, 70 % were caused by the nursing staff, 22 % by the medical staff and 8 % by cleaning and other personnel. During the course of hospitalisation, an non-significant increase in the costs generated by personnel was observed. A linear correlation was found between cumulated TISS 28 and the mean case costs. While there was no significant relationship between patient-specific score levels and individual case cost, the correlation between length of stay (LOS) and case cost was highly significant. Conclusion(s): The determining factor in the cost calculation of intensive care medicine are personnel costs. Overall cost is determined largely by the LOS, with such additional factors as age, diagnosis, comorbidity, etc. playing only an insignificant role. © Anasth Intensivmed 2010.",Excluded

882,"Mild toxicity and favorable prognosis of high-dose and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma Purpose: The value of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma has not been previously reported. The aim of the present study was to assess the dosimetric parameters, toxicity, and treatment outcomes of patients with nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Methods and Materials: Between 2003 and 2008, 42 patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma underwent definitive high-dose and extended involved-field IMRT with or without combination chemotherapy. The median radiation dose to the primary tumor was 50 Gy. The dose-volume histograms of the target volume and critical normal structures were evaluated in all patients. The locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The average mean dose delivered to the planning target volume was 55.5 Gy. Only 1.3% and 2.5% of the planning target volume received <90% and 95% of the prescribed dose, respectively, indicating excellent planning target volume coverage. The mean dose and average dose to the parotid glands was 15 Gy and 14 Gy, respectively. With a median follow-up time of 27 months, the 2-year locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survivalrate was 93%, 78%, and 74%, respectively. No Grade 4 or 5 acute or late toxicity was reported. Conclusion(s): High-dose and extended involved-field IMRT for patients with early-stage nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma showed favorable locoregional control, overall survival, and progression-free survival, with mild toxicity. The dose constraints of IMRT for the parotid glands can be limited to <20 Gy in these patients. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3456,"Quality of life, fatigue and local response of patients with unstable spinal bone metastases under radiation therapy--a prospective trial BACKGROUND: To evaluate the local response according to stability after radiotherapy (RT) with a special focus on quality-of-life (QoL), fatigue, pain and emotional distress in patients with unstable spinal bone metastases., METHODS: In this prospective trial, 30 patients were treated from September 2011 until March 2013. The stability of osteolytic metastases in the thoracic and lumbar spine was evaluated on the basis of the Taneichi-score after three and six months. EORTC QLQ-BM22, EORTC QLQ-FA13, and QSC-R10 were assessed at baseline, and three months after RT., RESULTS: After 3 months, 25% (n = 6) and after 6 months 33.3% (n = 8) were classified as stable. QoL, fatigue, and emotional distress showed no difference over the course. The pain response 3 months after RT showed a significant difference (p < 0.001). Pathological fractures occurred in 8.3% of the patients (n = 2) within six months following RT., CONCLUSIONS: Our trial demonstrated that RT can improve stability in one third of patients over a 6-months period with unstable spinal metastases.

3015,"Comparison of two new angiogenesis PET tracers 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2; in vivo imaging studies in human xenograft tumors Introduction: The aim of this study was to synthesize and perform a side-by-side comparison of two new tumor-angiogenesis PET tracers 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 in vivo using human xenograft tumors in mice. Human radiation burden was estimated to evaluate potential for future use as clinical PET tracers for imaging of neo-angiogenesis. Method(s): A 68Ge/68Ga generator was used for the synthesis of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2. 68Ga and 64Cu labeled NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 tracers were administrated in nude mice bearing either human glioblastoma (U87MG) or human neuroendocrine (H727) xenograft tumors. PET/CT scans at 3 time points were used for calculating the tracer uptake in tumors (%ID/g), integrin alphaVbeta3 target specificity was shown by blocking with cold NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2, and biodistribution in normal organs were also examined. From biodistribution data in mice human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM software. Result(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 was synthesized with a radiochemical purity of 89%-99% and a specific activity (SA) of 16-153MBq/nmol. 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 had a purity of 92%-99% and an SA of 64-78MBq/nmol.Both tracers showed similar uptake in xenograft tumors 1. h after injection (U87MG: 2.23 vs. 2.31%ID/g; H727: 1.53 vs. 1.48%ID/g). Both RGD dimers showed similar tracer uptake in non-tumoral tissues and a human radiation burden of less than 10. mSv with an administered dose of 200. MBq was estimated. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 can be easily synthesized and are both promising candidates for PET imaging of integrin alphaVbeta3 positive tumor cells. 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 showed slightly more stable tumor retention.

3012,"Investigating the SPECT Dose-Function Metrics Associated With Radiation-Induced Lung Toxicity Risk in Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy Purpose: Dose to normal lung has commonly been linked with radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT) risk, but incorporating functional lung metrics in treatment planning may help further optimize dose delivery and reduce RILT incidence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of the dose delivered to functional lung regions by analyzing perfusion (Q), ventilation (V), and combined V/Q single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) dose-function metrics with regard to RILT risk in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received radiation therapy (RT). Methods and Materials: SPECT images acquired from 88 patients with locally advanced NSCLC before undergoing conventionally fractionated RT were retrospectively analyzed. Dose was converted to the nominal dose equivalent per 2 Gy fraction, and SPECT intensities were normalized. Regional lung segments were defined, and the average dose delivered to each lung region was quantified. Three functional categorizations were defined to represent low-, normal-, and high-functioning lungs. The percent of functional lung category receiving >=20 Gy and mean functional intensity receiving >=20 Gy (iV20) were calculated. RILT was defined as grade 2+ radiation pneumonitis and/or clinical radiation fibrosis. A logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dose-function metrics and risk of RILT. Result(s): By analyzing V/Q normalized intensities and functional distributions across the population, a wide range in functional capability (especially in the ipsilateral lung) was observed in patients with NSCLC before RT. Through multivariable regression models, global lung average dose to the lower lung was found to be significantly associated with RILT, and Q and V iV20 were correlated with RILT when using ipsilateral lung metrics. Through a receiver operating characteristic analysis, combined V/Q low-function receiving >=20 Gy (low-functioning V/Q20) in the ipsilateral lung was found to be the best predictor (area under the curce: 0.79) of RILT risk. Conclusion(s): Irradiation of the inferior lung appears to be a locational sensitivity for RILT risk. The multivariable correlation between ipsilateral lung iV20 and RILT, as well as the association of low-functioning V/Q20 and RILT, suggest that irradiating low-functioning regions in the lung may lead to higher toxicity rates.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
1836,"Exposure to Radiation During Work Shifts and Working at Night Act as Occupational Stressors Alter Redox and Inflammatory Markers Background: Studies of breast cancer etiology suggest evidence that night shift working and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) are defined risk factors for breast cancer development. There are few studies to clarify neuroendocrine and inflammatory status and the possible consequences particularly in occupational exposure. Aim of the study. Our aim was to associate the redox and inflammatory biomarkers with either nightshift working or occupational radiation exposure, and to compare their levels between the two groups at Alexandria University Hospitals, Alexandria, Egypt. Method(s): We included 150 female nurses at Alexandria University Hospitals: 50 nightshift workers, 50 radiation workers, and 50 dayshift workers as a control group (neither work nightly nor radiation workers). In morning serum sample (7 am), we measured the concentrations of serum melatonin, Cortisol, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by ELISA; malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels colorimetrically, and C-reactive protein (C-RP) levels by turbidimetric method. Result(s): Nightshift workers had significantly lower levels of melatonin and TAC, and higher levels of serum inflammatory markers and cortisol, than day shift control group of workers. Workers occupationally exposed to IR had significantly higher levels of serum melatonin, MDA and inflammatory markers, lower levels of serum cortisol, and lower TAC than day shift workers. Conclusion(s): Occupational exposure to IR and working nightly alter circulating redox and inflammatory biomarkers.Copyright © 2020 IMSS",Excluded
1764,"A summary of activities of the US/Soviet-Russian joint working group on space biology and medicine The very foundation of cooperation between the United States (US) and Russia (former Soviet Union) in space exploration is a direct result of the mutual desire for scientific understanding and the creation of a collaborative mechanismthe Joint Working Group (JWG) on Space Biology and Medicine. From the dawn of the space age, it has been the quest of humankind to understand its place in the universe. While nations can and do solve problems independently, it takes nations, working together, to accomplish great things. The formation of the JWG provided an opportunity for the opening of a series of productive relationships between the superpowers, the US and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR); and served as a justification for continued relationship for medical assistance in spaceflight, and to showcase Earth benefits from space medicine research. This relationship has been played out on an international scale with the construction and operation of the International Space Station. The fundamental reason for this successful endeavor is a direct result of the spirit and perseverance of the men and women who have worked diligently side-by-side to promote science and move our understanding of space forward. This manuscript provides a historical perspective of the JWG; how it came about; its evolution; what it accomplished; and what impact it has had and continues to have in the 21st century with regard to human spaceflight and space life sciences research. It captures the spirit of this group, which has been in continuous existence for over 40 years, and provides a never before reported summary of its activities.

2784,"A tactile display for International Space Station (ISS) extravehicular activity (EVA) Background: A tactile display to increase an astronaut's situational awareness during an extravehicular activity (EVA) has been developed and ground tested. The Tactor Locator System (TLS) is a non-intrusive, intuitive display capable of conveying position and velocity information via a vibrotactile stimulus applied to the subject's neck and torso. In the Earth's 1 G environment, perception of position and velocity is determined by the body's individual sensory systems. Under normal sensory conditions, redundant information from these sensory systems provides humans with an accurate sense of their position and motion. However, altered environments, including exposure to weightlessness, can lead to conflicting visual and vestibular cues, resulting in decreased situational awareness. The TLS was designed to provide somatosensory cues to complement the visual system during EVA operations. Method(s): An EVA task was simulated on a computer graphics workstation with a display of the International Space Station (ISS) and a target astronaut at an unknown location. Subjects were required to move about the ISS and acquire the target astronaut using either an auditory cue at the outset, or the TLS. Subjects used a 6 degree of freedom input device to command translational and rotational motion. The TLS was configured to act as a position aid, providing target direction information to the subject through a localized stimulus. Result(s): Results show that the TLS decreases reaction time (p = 0.001) and movement time (p = 0.001) for simulated subject (astronaut) motion around the ISS. Conclusion(s): The TLS is a useful aid in increasing an astronaut's situational awareness, and warrants further testing to explore other uses, tasks and configurations.",Excluded
2118,"Optimizing the flattening filter free beam selection in RapidArc R-based stereotactic body radiotherapy for Stage I lung cancer OBJECTIVE: To optimize the flattening filter-free (FFF) beam selection in stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment for Stage I lung cancer in different fraction schemes., METHODS: Treatment plans from 12 patients suffering from Stage I lung cancer were designed using the 6XFFF and 10XFFF beams in different fraction schemes of 4 x 12, 3 x 18 and 1 x 34 Gy. Plans were evaluated mainly in terms of organs at risk (OARs) sparing, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) estimation and treatment efficiency., RESULTS: Compared with the 10XFFF beam, 6XFFF beam showed statistically significant lower dose to all the OARs investigated. The percentage of NTCP reduction for both lung and chest wall was about 10% in the fraction schemes of 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy, whereas only 7.4% and 2.6% was obtained in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme. For oesophagus, heart and spinal cord, the reduction was greater with the 6XFFF beam, but their absolute estimates were <10(-6)%. The mean beam-on time for 6XFFF and 10XFFF beams at 4 x 12, 3 x 18 and 1 x 34 Gy schemes were 2.2 +/- 0.2 vs 1.5 +/- 0.1, 3.3 +/- 0.9 vs 2.0 +/- 0.5 and 6.3 +/- 0.9 vs 3.5 +/- 0.4 min, respectively., CONCLUSION: The 6XFFF beam obtains better OARs sparing and lower incidence of NTCP in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer, whereas the 10XFFF beam improves the treatment efficiency. To balance the OARs sparing and intrafractional variation owing to the prolonged treatment time, the authors recommend using the 6XFFF beam in the 4 x 12 and 3 x 18 Gy schemes but the 10XFFF beam in the 1 x 34 Gy scheme., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This study optimizes the FFF beam selection in different fraction schemes in SBRT treatment of Stage I lung cancer.",Excluded
1443,"Navigated minimally invasive unilateral laminotomy with crossover for intraoperative prediction of outcome in degenerative lumbar stenosis Background: Different surgical techniques have been described for treatment of degenerative lumbar stenosis (DLS). Only postoperative measures have been identified as predictors of efficacy of decompression. The objective of this study is to assess the role of navigated unilateral laminotomy with crossover to achieve and predict a satisfying decompression and outcome in DLS. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled patients with DLS who underwent navigation-assisted unilateral laminotomy with crossover. The extent of decompression was evaluated during surgery using neuronavigation. The outcome was assessed through the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) for leg pain. Outcome correlation with the extent of the intraoperative bone decompression was analyzed. Finally, the outcome, surgical time, and in-hospital length-of-stay were compared with a control group treated through standard unilateral laminotomy. Result(s): Twenty-five patients were treated using the navigated technique (Group A), 25 using the standard unilateral laminotomy (Group B). In Group A, a cut-off value >=0.9 cm for bone decompression revealed to be an intraoperative predictor of good outcome, both regarding the ODI and VAS scores (P = 0.0005; P = 0.002). As compared with Group B, patients operated using the navigated technique showed similar operative times, in-hospital length-of-stay, ODI scores, but improved VAS scores for leg pain (P = 0.04). Conclusion(s): The intraoperative navigated evaluation of the bone decompression could predict the outcome allowing satisfactory results in unilateral laminotomy for DLS. The navigated technique also could lead to an improved decompression of lateral recesses resulting in better control of leg pain as compared to standard unilateral laminotomy.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Craniovertebral Junction and Spine Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.",Excluded
2775,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded
2421,"Efficacy of sonography as a guidance technique for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes OBJECTIVE: In the United States, CT is generally considered the guidance technique of choice for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sonography for this purpose., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We attempted 26 sonographically guided biopsies of five abdominal, six pelvic, and 12 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 23 patients. The patients included 19 women and four men who were 26-76 years old (mean, 50 years old). The nodes were less than 2 cm in 16 patients, 2-3 cm in four patients, and greater than 3 cm in three patients. Biopsies were considered successful if the nodes could be visualized and biopsied using sonographic guidance and the pathologist's final report indicated that the tissue specimens obtained were adequate for diagnosis. The length of the procedures and the number of complications were recorded., RESULTS: Lymph nodes were visualized and biopsied with sonographic guidance in 23 (88%) of the 26 attempts. Three biopsies could not be performed with sonography because of poor visualization of the nodes. Adequate tissue for cytologic or histologic evaluation was obtained in 21 (91%) of the 23 sonographically guided procedures. In the 21 successful procedures, clinical and imaging follow-up showed no evidence of false-negative diagnoses. The time from the placement of the patient in the interventional sonography room to completion of the procedure ranged from 25 to 60 min (mean, 35 min) for sonographically guided biopsies. We had no procedure-related complications., CONCLUSION: Sonography is an accurate and safe guidance technique for lymph node biopsies in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. This technique is efficacious for deep nodes as small as 1 cm in diameter. The advantages of sonography over CT include no need for ionizing radiation, portability, shorter procedure time, and real-time visualization of the needle throughout the procedure. These advantages, and the fact that sonography costs less than CT, suggest that sonography is a more appropriate guidance technique in this era of cost containment.",Excluded
273,"Factors influencing aversion to specific electrodiagnostic studies Objective: To compare the degree of discomfort caused by nerve conduction studies (NCS) versus needle electromyography (EMG), and to determine what factors predict aversion to one test or the other. Method(s): Two hundred patients underwent both EMG and NCS, and were asked to indicate which test was more uncomfortable. Responses were then correlated with demographic information, testing characteristics, and medical histories to identify any notable associations. Result(s): Of the 200 patients, 58.5% (117) of the patients found the NCS more uncomfortable than EMG. Sixty-one percent (11/18) of the younger patients (18-29 years old) found EMG more uncomfortable (P = 0.08), whereas 68% (40/59) of the older patients (age greater than 60 years old) found NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.05). Sixty-seven percent (14/21) of the patients whose BMI was less than 22 kg/m2 rated EMG as more uncomfortable (P = 0.01). Sixty-nine percent (27/39) of the patients whose BMI was greater than or equal to 38 found the NCS more uncomfortable (P = 0.02). A positive correlation existed between NCS discomfort and number of nerves tested. 67% (35/52) of the patients with polyneuropathy found NCS more uncomfortable. Conclusion(s): Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG in the majority of patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible. Nerve conduction studies are more uncomfortable than needle EMG for most patients, and predictions regarding which test will be more uncomfortable for a given patient are possible.Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

3225,"Can we predict failure of internal fixation when treating femoral neck fractures? At present, femoral head saving surgery is reserved for femoral neck fracture patients who are either young or have suffered a minimally displaced fracture. However, even after this strict selection, an approximate failure rate of internal fixation of 15% is described in the literature. The present study looked if failures can be discerned from successes by baseline differences. Files and X-rays of 164 consecutive femoral neck fracture patients treated by internal fixation in our hospital between 1996 and 2002 were studied, retrospectively. Successfully treated patients and failures (defined as the need for an arthroplasty following internal fixation) were compared with regard to patient's age, pretraumatic mobility, fracture dislocation, fracture angle, operative delay, operative duration and experience of the surgeon. Of the 164 patients undergoing internal fixation for a femoral neck fracture, 16 were classified as failures (10%) and 148 were treated successfully. There was no statistical difference between groups with regard to any of the studied variables. Patients in whom internal fixation of femoral neck fractures fails, cannot be discerned from successfully treated patients by preoperative variables. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded

Conclusion(s): Food characteristics help to maintain patient appetite at cumulative radiation doses of 30/50 Gy. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
2544,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded
3354,"Evaluating the radioprotective effect of Cimetidine, IMOD, and hybrid radioprotectors agents: An in-vitro study Introduction: There are various radioprotective agents with different mechanisms that help to decrease ionizing radiation side effects. The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells. Method(s): Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups. Result(s): The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively. Conclusion(s): In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
435,"Assessment of Corneal Backward Light Scattering in Diabetic Patients OBJECTIVES: To analyze corneal backward light scattering differences in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus., METHODS: We enrolled 43 eyes from 43 diabetic patients and 40 eyes from 40 healthy controls. Corneal backward light scattering was evaluated using densitometry measurements from different corneal layers and zones obtained using Scheimpflug tomography (PentacamHR)., RESULTS: When densitometry values were divided by depth, anterior layer of diabetic corneas displayed significantly higher corneal backward light scattering values than controls (32.05, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 31.02-33.08 vs. 29.18, 95% CI, 27.60-30.76, P=0.024). Corneal densitometry measurements were also significantly higher in diabetic eyes compared with control eyes, when considered by concentric zones of total cornea in the 0 to 2 mm (21.65, 95% CI, 20.28-23.01 vs. 18.87 95% CI, 18.49-19.25, P=0.020), and anterior layer in the 0 to 2 mm (27.3, 95% CI, 25.04-29.56 vs. 22.31, 95% CI, 20.57-24.05, P<0.001), 2 to 6 mm (26.2, 95% CI, 24.99-27.41 vs. 22.4, 95% CI, 20.18-24.62, P<0.001) and 6 to 10 mm (32.19, 95% CI, 29.98-34.40 vs. 27.2, 95% CI, 25.39-29.01, P=0.022). There was excellent positive correlation between anterior total corneal densitometry measurements and duration of diabetes (r=0.802, P<0.001), although no significant correlation was observed with anterior total corneal densitometry measurements and hemoglobin A1c levels (r=0.080, P=0.621) in diabetic eyes., CONCLUSIONS: Backward light scattering values from the anterior layer of the cornea is greater in diabetic eyes than in controls. Anterior total corneal densitometry measurements show positive correlation with the duration of diabetes.",Excluded

1194,"Registry of Plutonium-induced Lung Fibrosis in a Russian Nuclear Worker Cohort A registry of plutonium-induced lung fibrosis diagnosed in members of a cohort of the first Russian nuclear industry facility Mayak Production Association was established. The registry includes 188 plutonium-induced lung fibrosis diagnoses: 117 (62.23%) in males and 71 (37.77%) in females. This paper describes the structure and detailed characteristics of the registry. Plutonium-induced lung fibrosis was shown to have no association with cumulative lung absorbed dose from external gamma rays as of the date of diagnosis. On the contrary, the plutonium-induced lung fibrosis rate was shown to be associated with cumulative lung absorbed dose from incorporated alpha particles and to increase significantly with increasing dose from internal radiation exposure.

1749,"Patient-reported outcome (PRO) as an addition to long-term results after high-precision stereotactic radiotherapy in patients with secreting and non-secreting pituitary adenomas: A retrospective cohort study up to 17-years follow-up High-precision radiotherapy has been established as a valid and effective treatment option in patients with pituitary adenomas. We report on outcome after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in correlation with patient-reported outcomes (PROs). We analyzed 69 patients treated between 2000 and 2019. FSRT was delivered with a median total dose of 54 Gy (single fraction: 1.8 Gy). PRO questionnaires were sent to 28 patients. Median overall survival was 17.2 years; mean local control was 15.6 years (median not reached). Median follow-up was 5.8 years. Twenty (71%) patients participated in the PRO assessment. Physicians reported symptoms grade >=3 in 6 cases (9%). Of all, 35 (51%) patients suffered from hypopituitarism at baseline, and during follow-up, new or progressive hypopituitarism was observed in 11 cases (16%). Patients reported 10 cases of severe side effects. Most of these symptoms were already graded as CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) grade 2 by a physician in a previous follow-up exam. PROs are an essential measure and only correlate to a certain extent with the physician-reported outcomes. For high-precision radiotherapy of pituitary adenomas, they confirm excellent overall outcomes and low toxicity. In the future, the integration of PROs paired with high-end treatment will further improve outcomes.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
3018,"Consolidation radiotherapy in patients with advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma: survival data from the UKLG LY09 randomized controlled trial (ISRCTN97144519) PURPOSE: This study analyzed the outcomes of nonrandomized consolidation radiotherapy (RT) given after chemotherapy in the initial treatment of advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). The results were collected prospectively within a randomized controlled trial of induction chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned between doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine and one of two prespecified multidrug regimens. At least six cycles of chemotherapy were planned, with up to eight for patients showing slower response. Involved-field RT was recommended for incomplete response to chemotherapy or bulk disease at presentation. The primary outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS), landmarked from the end of chemotherapy., RESULTS: Among 807 patients randomly assigned, 702 achieved objective response. Postchemotherapy RT for consolidation was reported in 300 (43%). With median follow-up of 6.9 years, 161 PFS events and 83 deaths were reported. Baseline characteristics showed more patients with bulk disease having RT (190 [63%] v 111 [28%]) and only partial response after chemotherapy (150 [50%] v 36 [9%]). Other baseline characteristics were similar. PFS was superior for patients having RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.60) with 5-year PFS 71% without RT, 86% with RT. A similar advantage was seen for overall survival (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.77). There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect across subgroups., CONCLUSION: Patients who received consolidation RT apparently had better outcomes, consistently across all prognostic groups which persisted in multivariate analysis. This suggests that RT contributes significantly to the cure rate for advanced HL, although patient selection for combined modality treatment requires better definition in prospective trials.",Excluded
2109,"Segmental Differences in Radiation-Induced Alterations of Tight Junction-Related Proteins in Non-Human Primate Jejunum, Ileum and Colon Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included

One pair of radiographs was obtained with the digital selenium chest radiography system, and the other with conventional film-screen technique. 9 criteria were rated using a 4 point scale. Technical parameters were standardised. Radiation dose was measured in both techniques and compared., RESULTS: A total of 855 criteria were rated. 740 findings were diagnosed in accordance on both techniques (740/855 = 87%). 115 criteria (115/855 = 13%) showed deviations. The mean radiation dose for the selenium detector was 0.02 cGy and for the conventional system 0.11 cGy., CONCLUSION: The exposure of radiation is lower using a selenium x-ray detector compared to conventional film-screen technique in chest radiography. The digital selenium system performs well in a clinical setting, providing visualisation of pathological findings as good as a standard screen-film system.",Excluded
2163,"Three- Versus Five-Fraction Regimens of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Peripheral Early-Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Two-Institution Propensity Score-Matched Analysis We compared the outcomes of 3- versus 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy regimens for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Analysis was performed on 192 eligible lesions and a propensity score-matched 94 lesion subgroup. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between regimens, and both regimens are reasonable treatment options. Purpose(s): To evaluate differences in outcomes of early-stage peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with either 3- or 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) at 2 institutions. Patients and Methods: Patients diagnosed with peripherally located early-stage NSCLC who received either a median dose of 60 Gy (interquartile range [IQR], 60-60, biologically effective dose, 151-151) in 3 fractions or a median dose of 50 Gy (IQR, 50-50, biologically effective dose, 94-94) in 5 fractions were included in this study. All data were retrospectively collected and reviewed in an institutional review board-approved database. Result(s): A total of 192 lesions in 192 patients were identified: 94 received 3-fraction SBRT and 98 received 5-fraction SBRT. Patients in the 5-fraction cohort had significantly smaller tumors (P =.0021). Larger tumor size was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.40, P =.0013) for all patients. A single grade 3 toxicity was reported in each cohort. A propensity score-matched cohort of 94 patients was constructed with a median follow-up of 29.3 months (IQR, 17.3-44.6) for the 3-fraction cohort and 31.0 months (IQR, 17.0-48.5) for the 5-fraction cohort (P =.84). There were no statistically significant differences between these 2 cohorts in overall survival (P =.33), progression-free survival (P =.40), local failure (P =.86), and nodal or distant failure (P =.57) at 2 years. Conclusion(s): The 3- and 5-fraction SBRT regimens for early-stage peripheral NSCLC had comparable clinical outcomes. Both regimens were well tolerated.

2634,"Coronary artery operation in radiation-associated atherosclerosis: long-term follow-up Radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis is a potential problem for patients who have had mediastinal irradiation for malignant tumors. This study identified 14 patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis, defines unique population characteristics, and analyses postsurgical problems and long-term outcome. Fourteen patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis and class III and IV New York Heart Association symptoms were identified because of mediastinal or chest wall irradiation (30 Gy) associated with anterior epicardial discoloration or fibrosis, aortitis with adventitial thickening, and inflammatory process over a proximal coronary artery. Two distinct treatment groups were analyzed. Coronary artery operation resulted in one hospital death, with vein grafts being used predominantly. The internal mammary artery could only be used in 3 patients because of vessel friability and mediastinal fibrosis. Postoperative right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary problems were frequent. Severe pericardial inflammatory complications (fibrosis with graft closure, and constrictive pericarditis) present in 2 early patients resulted in routine anterior pericardiectomy after coronary artery operation without further problems. Long-term follow-up (100%) (range, 11 to 74 months) revealed that 1 patient died late and of the remainder (12 patients), 11 were in New York Heart Association class I and 1 in class II, experiencing three myocardial events. Thus, patients with radiation-associated coronary atherosclerosis have a low operative mortality but have risk of early right ventricular and pulmonary dysfunction. The routine use of internal mammary artery may not be possible and anterior pericardiectomy is recommended. Long-term results are excellent and no evidence of accelerated disease has been noted.",Excluded

All patients were assessed for resectability after 6 weeks by clinical examination and by CT scan and those deemed resectable underwent surgery., RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were randomized, 46 to Arm 1 and 44 to Arm 2. Eighty seven patients (44 in Arm 1 and 41 in Arm 2) completed the prescribed treatment protocol. Overall resectability rate was low in both the groups; R0 resection was achieved in 20 (43 %) patients in Arm 1 vs. 15 (34 %) in Arm 2. Adverse factors that significantly affected the resectability rate in both the groups were extension of tumor to pelvic bones and signet ring cell pathology. Complete pathological response was seen in 7 and 11 %, respectively. There was greater morbidity such as wound infection and delayed wound healing in Arm 2 (16 vs. 40 %; p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Escalated radiation dose without chemotherapy does not achieve higher complete (R0) tumor resectability in locally advanced inoperable rectal cancers, compared to concurrent chemoradiation.",Excluded
453,"Utility of postoperative radiographs for cervical spine fusion: A comprehensive evaluation of operative technique, surgical indication, and duration since surgery STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE.: To assess the utility of postoperative radiographs in patients across a spectrum of cervical fusion procedures, surgical indication, and time since surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographs are routinely obtained after cervical spine fusion despite lack of evidence supporting such practice. Studies assessing postoperative radiographical utility in the cervical spine have been limited. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated the utility of obtaining such radiographs across multiple cervical fusion procedures. METHODS.: A total of 972 clinic notes from 301 patients during a 10-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in this study underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion, a combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and anterior corpectomy and fusion (hybrid), posterior spine fusion, or 360degree fusion. All postoperative clinic notes and radiographs were reviewed for abnormalities and changes in treatment course. It was determined whether an abnormal radiograph alone led to a change in treatment course among the various operative techniques, surgical indication, or time since surgery. RESULTS.: No statistical significant difference in radiograph utility between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (0 changes in treatment course due to radiograph alone out of 332 clinic notes), anterior corpectomy and fusion (0 of 140), hybrid procedure (1 of 72), posterior spine fusion (5 of 357), and 360degree fusion (0 of 71) was found. Surgical indication (trauma vs. degeneration) and duration from surgery yielded no statistical significant difference in radiograph utility. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of radiographs were 33.8%, 87.6%, 19.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION.: Regardless of operative techniques performed, surgical indication, and time since surgery, routine postoperative radiographs provide low utility in guiding treatment course in asymptomatic patients. Although radiographs may provide important diagnostic utility in certain individual cases, the results of this study provide further evidence that radiographs should not be considered routine during postoperative visits, thus minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure and medical costs.

1176,"Indwelling voice prosthesis insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction Objectives: Total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction is often performed in patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma. However, postoperative speechlessness significantly decreases patient quality of life. We investigated whether Provox insertion could preserve speech after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Method(s): A total of 130 cases of secondary Provox insertions after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction were analyzed. Communication outcomes were compared using the Head and Neck Cancer Understandability of Speech Subscale. Outcomes and complications associated with insertion site (jejunal insertion vs. esophageal insertion) and adjuvant irradiation therapy were also evaluated. Result(s): Provox insertion had favorable communication outcomes in 102 cases (78.4%). Neither the insertion site nor irradiation affected the communication outcome. Complications were observed in 20 cases (15.4%). Local infection was the most common complication. Free jejunal insertion, in which the resection range was enlarged, had a lower complication rate than did esophageal insertion, and its complication rate was unaffected by previous irradiation. For all patients, the hospitalization duration and duration of speechlessness were 13.4 days and 14.6 months, respectively. Patients receiving jejunal insertions had a significantly shorter hospitalization duration than did those receiving esophageal insertions. Unlike Provox2, ProvoxVega significantly reduced the complication rate to zero. Conclusion(s): For jejunal inserson of a Provox prosthetic, a sufficient margin can be maintained during total pharyngolaryngectomy and irradiation can be performed, and satisfactory communication outcomes were observed. Provox insertion after total pharyngolaryngectomy with free jejunal reconstruction should be considered the standard therapy for voice restoration.

720,"Is lateral opening of the cup related to pelvic tilt on the surgical table? Introduction: Surgical table and floor are the usual references for positioning the cup. This is correct if pelvis is perpendicular to them (tilt 0degree). But if shoulder girdle is wider than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the feet. And if shoulder girdle is narrower than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the head. Objective(s): To analyse pelvic tilt on surgical table ant its influence on lateral opening of the cup. Method(s): Prospective, blind, observational study. Fifty THA patients (26 female), 1 department, multiple surgeons. Lateral decubitus, horizontal surgical table, conventional anterior (pubic) and posterior (lumbar spine) supports. Preoperative measures: (with custom-made measuring device) width of shoulder and pelvic girdles, pelvic tilt (angle between horizontal surgical table and a line by both antero-superior iliac spines), pelvic tilt towards head or feet. Postero-lateral approach. Theoretical position of cup intended by surgeons: 45degree valgus. Post-surgical x-ray: measure of lateral opening of cup. Result(s): 21/50 (4 males): pelvic girdle 27 mm wider than shoulder girdle (female phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 7degree towards head, theoretical risk of horizontal cup. Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded
2097,"Dose-painting intensity-modulated proton therapy for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma Background: Newly diagnosed WHO grade II-III or any WHO grade recurrent meningioma exhibit an aggressive behavior and thus are considered as high- or intermediate risk tumors. Given the unsatisfactory rates of disease control and survival after primary or adjuvant radiation therapy, optimization of treatment strategies is needed. We investigated the potential of dose-painting intensity-modulated proton beam-therapy (IMPT) for intermediate- and high-risk meningioma. Material(s) and Method(s): Imaging data from five patients undergoing proton beam-therapy were used. The dose-painting target was defined using [68]Ga-[1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid]- d-Phe1,Tyr3-octreotate ([68]Ga-DOTATATE)-positron emission tomography (PET) in target delineation. IMPT and photon intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans were generated for each patient using an in-house developed treatment planning system (TPS) supporting spot-scanning technology and a commercial TPS, respectively. Doses of 66 Gy (2.2 Gy/fraction) and 54 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction) were prescribed to the PET-based planning target volume (PTVPET) and the union of PET- and anatomical imaging-based PTV, respectively, in 30 fractions, using simultaneous integrated boost. Result(s): Dose coverage of the PTVsPET was equally good or slightly better in IMPT plans: dose inhomogeneity was 10 +/- 3% in the IMPT plans vs. 13 +/- 1% in the IMRT plans (p = 0.33). The brain Dmean and brainstem D50 were small in the IMPT plans: 26.5 +/- 1.5 Gy(RBE) and 0.002 +/- 0.0 Gy(RBE), respectively, vs. 29.5 +/- 1.5 Gy (p = 0.001) and 7.5 +/- 11.1 Gy (p = 0.02) for the IMRT plans, respectively. The doses delivered to the optic structures were also decreased with IMPT. Conclusion(s): Dose-painting IMPT is technically feasible using currently available planning tools and resulted in dose conformity of the dose-painted target comparable to IMRT with a significant reduction of radiation dose delivered to the brain, brainstem and optic apparatus. Dose escalation with IMPT may improve tumor control and decrease radiation-induced toxicity.Copyright © 2015 Madani et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Excluded

1467,"Pulmonary resection after high-dose and low-dose chest irradiation BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of pulmonary resection after low and high dose neoadjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study using an electronic prospective database from January 1998 to August 2004. All patients had N2, stage IIIa, nonsmall cell lung cancer, and received neoadjuvant carboplatinum-based chemotherapy with similar doses. In addition, some patients received high-dose chest radiation (HD) equal to or greater than 60 Gy and were compared with those who received low-dose radiation (LD) less than 60 Gy. All bronchial stumps were buttressed with an intercostal muscle., RESULTS: There were 104 patients, 50 in the LD group and 54 patients in the HD group. Median dose of radiation was 45 Gy (range 35-50.4) in the LD group and 60 Gy (range 60-66.7) in the HD group. Complete pathologic response rate was 10% compared to 28% favoring the HD group (p = 0.04). Median length of stay for both groups was 4 days and the ICU was avoided in 74%. Major morbidity and mortality rates were similar: 8% compared to 9% and 2% compared to 3.7% for the low and high dose groups, respectively. Pneumonectomy was a significant risk factor for morbidity (OR = 17.0)., CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary resection after preoperative chest radiation is safe even after 60 Gy or higher. Sixty or higher may afford an increase in complete pathologic response and it does not seem to increase morbidity or mortality. However, if pneumonectomy is known to be required we prefer to avoid neoadjuvant radiotherapy and use chemotherapy alone.",Excluded

Therefore, the measurement of MP might be of a great potential for providing new insight into low-dose radiation cardiovascular risk. Aim(s): We investigated the effect of long-term medical occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation (LDIR) on MP populations levels. Method(s): The current study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration on 38 healthy medical workers occupationally exposed to LDIR and 29 matched controls by gender, age, and smoking habits. The measured MP by flow cytometry were classified as positive or negative phosphatidylserine (PS+ or PS-), and phenotyped according to their cellular origin. Result(s): Total MP (PS-/PS+), regardless of phenotype, were significantly higher in workers occupationally exposed to LDIR than controls (p=0.0004). In medical exposed workers, PS- MP predominated (68%) and were approximately three times more common than PS+ MP. Concerning the measurement of MP according to their cellular origin, we found that MP derived from platelets (CD41a+ PMP), endothelial (CD146+ EMP), leucocytes (CD45+ LMP) and erythrocytes (CD235a+ RMP) are more abundant in exposed workers than those in controls (p< 0.0001). However, no significant difference was found in the proportion of the other blood elements in the peripheral circulation between the two groups. In addition, no association was observed between MP levels and the studied confounding factors. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that elevated circulating MP populations levels represent an indicator of cellular damage caused by medical exposure to LDIR. By consequence, the quantification of MP seems to a useful biomarker for assessing the negative effects of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. (Figure Presented) .",Included
1893,"Diagnostic medical imaging radiation exposure and risk of development of solid and hematologic malignancy Limiting patients' exposure to ionizing radiation during diagnostic imaging is of concern to patients and clinicians. Large single-dose exposures and cumulative exposures to ionizing radiation have been associated with solid tumors and hematologic malignancy. Although these associations have been a driving force in minimizing patients' exposure, significant risks are found when diagnoses are missed and subsequent treatment is withheld. Therefore, based on epidemiologic data obtained after nuclear and occupational exposures, dose exposure limits have been estimated. A recent collaborative effort between the US Food and Drug Administration and the American College of Radiology has provided information and tools that patients and imaging professionals can use to avoid unnecessary ionizing radiation scans and ensure use of the lowest feasible radiation dose necessary for studies. Further collaboration, research, and development should focus on producing technological advances that minimize individual study exposures and duplicate studies. This article outlines the research used to govern safe radiation doses, defines recent initiatives in decreasing radiation exposure, and provides orthopedic surgeons with techniques that may help decrease radiation exposure in their daily practice.

762,"Measurement of lung airways in three dimensions using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R(2) = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R(2) value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments). The feasibility for airway path analysis to areas of ventilation defect is also demonstrated.",Excluded
356,"Increased circulating cell-free DNA levels and mtDNA fragments in interventional cardiologists occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) and mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) have often been used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in acute and chronic disorders, but little is known about changes in ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA concentrations following radiation exposure. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR. No significant relationships were found between ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA, and age, gender, smoking, or other clinical parameters. Ccf-DNA levels (44.2 +/- 31.1 vs. 30.6 +/- 19.2 ng/ml, P = 0.013), ccf-mtDNA-79 (2.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and ccf-mtDNA-230 copies (2.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in interventional cardiologists compared with the non-exposed group. In a subset (n = 15) of interventional cardiologists with a reliable reconstruction of cumulative professional exposure (59.7 +/- 48.4 mSv; range: 1.4-182 mS), ccf-DNA (53.2 +/- 41.3 vs. 36.4 +/- 22.9 and 32.2 +/- 20.5, P = 0.08), mtDNA-79 (2.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.03 +/- 1.7 and 1.09 +/- 0.82, P = 0.05), and mtDNA-230 (2.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.4 and 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.09) tended to be significantly increased in high-exposure subjects compared with both low-exposure interventional cardiologists and controls. Our results provide evidence for a possible role of circulating DNA as a relevant biomarker of cellular damage induced by exposure to chronic low-dose radiation.

1953,"Geometrical changes of parotid, submandibular, and thyroid glands during intensity modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Both the tumor and organs at risk (OARs) occurred considerable changes during the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) course for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aims to analyze quantitatively the geometrical variations of the parotid, submandibular gland (SMG) and thyroid as three independent OARs throughout IMRT course. Materials/Methods: Twenty NPC patients received the definitive chemo-IMRT in 33 fractions within 6.5 week-long course. Each patient had a planning CT (pCT) and six weekly repeat CT (rCT) without enhanced contrast. Each rCT was rigidly registered to its pCT. The parotid, SMG and thyroid were manually delineated in the axial pCT and rCT imaging by a single radiation oncologist. When compared a contour in pCT with rCT, it was calculated the volume of each contour (V-pCT, V-rCT), the common volume (V-com) and the shortest perpendicular distance (SPD) between two contours. Each surface voxel of a contour in rCT has a SPD and the standard deviation (SD) of all the SPDs was calculated. Both the SPD and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) calculated as 2*V-com / (V-pCT + V-rCT) were used as the surrogate of the shape variations. The displacement of center of mass as the positional shift was calculated and the mean displacement, system and random error were statistically calculated. The difference of geometrical changes among six week, the left- and right- sided OAR was compared using one-way analysis of variance or Mann-Whitney U test. Result(s): The mean radiation dose of the parotid, SMG, thyroid gland were 32.12 >= 11.2 Gy, 25.46 >= 8.62 Gy, 18.89 >= 10.24 Gy, (mean >= standard deviation) respectively. And their mean and maximal volume reduction were 28.6% >= 14.6%, 26.6% >= 17.1%, 12.3% >= 11.3% and 40.6% >= 12.4%, 38.9%>=14.9%, 16.3%>=14.3%, respectively. For the parotid and SMG, the volume loss per treatment day decreased from 1.7%, 1.6% in the first week to 0.5%, 0.6% in the last week, and that of thyroid was of 0.4% - 0.5% after the 2nd week. The center of mass displacement of parotid gland shifted medially 2.0 mm - 2.6 mm, SMG and thyroid did medially 0.1 mm - 0.5 mm. In addition, the displacement in anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal direction were < 0.6 mm. The 3-demensional vector displacements of the parotid and SMG were 2.2mme 2.9mmand that of thyroid were 4.0mm- 4.3 mm. The DSCs of parotid, SMGand thyroid showed the decreased time-trend. For the parotid, SMG, thyroid, the SD of SPDs increased from 1.5 mm e 1.8 mm in the first week to 2.1mme2.5 mm. The variations among the different weeks were statistically different (P < 0.05) and there was no difference between the left- and right-sided OARs (P> 0.05). Conclusion(s): For NPC, the volume, position and shape of parotid, SMG, thyroid occurred in quantifiable variations and these geometrical changes have their time-trend, which suggests the necessity of re-planning for the further sparing of OAR further during IMRT.",Excluded
1038,"Trends in radiation dose and technique for anal canal squamous cell carcinoma Background: Anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is managed definitively with chemo and XRT, reserving surgery for salvage. Many different radiation dose schemes have been used, varying from 30 Gy to doses exceeding 60 Gy. RTOG 0529 established IMRT as a standard of care for anal canal SCC, using doses of 50.4-54 Gy. We used the National Cancer Database(NCDB) to examine trends in dose selection and radiation technique over time, as well as any potential effect on outcome. Method(s): We queried the NCDB from 2004-2015 for cases of anal canal SCC stage 1-3, treated with definitive doses of XRT to the pelvis with chemo. Dose escalation was defined as > 54 Gy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of increased dose and overall survival (OS). Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios for survival were used to account for indication bias. Result(s): We identified 7,792 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, with 4,269 treated to conventional doses and 3,163 treated to > 54 Gy. Patients that were older, had government or private insurance, were treated with IMRT, or at an academic center in a more recent year were less likely to get dose escalation. Increasing T and N stage were predictive of escalated dose. The use of dose escalation decreased over time, from 50% in 2005 to 30% in 2015. In contrast, IMRT use increased over that time from 2% to 63%. On multivariable analysis increasing age, higher comorbidity score, treatment at an academic center, and increasing stage corresponded to worse OS. Increased income, private insurance, IMRT use, increased distance to facility, and female gender all predicted improved OS. Multivariable analysis with propensity score included confirmed increased age, higher comorbidity score, income, distance, and gender as predictive of OS. In addition, escalated dose was found to have inferior outcome (OR: 1.10 95%CI: 1.01-1.20, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): The results of this NCDB analysis show a steady increase in the use of IMRT over time, with a corresponding decrease in dose escalation. In this study, dose escalation was shown to have inferior outcomes, although that result is likely influenced by the increasing age, stage, and comorbidity scores in that group of patients.",Excluded
1959,"Identification of ureteral stones at reduced radiation exposure: a pilot study comparing conventional versus digital low-dosage linear slot scanning (Lodox R) radiography PURPOSE: Digital low-dosage, linear slot scanning radiography (Lodox R) is an imaging modality that can emit down to one-tenth the radiation of conventional X-ray systems. We prospectively evaluated Lodox R as a diagnostic imaging modality in patients with ureterolithiasis., METHODS: Conventional kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) X-ray and Lodox R were performed in 41 patients presenting with acute flank pain due to unilateral ureteral stone confirmed by computed tomography. KUB X-ray and Lodox R images were then reviewed by four blinded readers (urology expert/resident, radiology expert/resident). Identification rates were compared using Pearson's Chi square test. The impact of different parameters on stone identification by Lodox R was evaluated using logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models. Inter-reader agreement was tested using Cohen's kappa coefficient., RESULTS: Median stone size was 5 mm (range 2-12), median stone density was 800 HU (range 200-1500). The identification rates of the urology expert were 68% for KUB X-ray and 90% for Lodox R (p = 0.014), and for all four readers 61% for KUB X-ray and 62% for Lodox R (p = 0.8). Radiation exposure for KUB X-ray and Lodox R was 0.45 mSv (SD +/- 0.64) and 0.027 mSv (SD +/- 0.038), respectively. Multivariable analyses showed an association between stone identification by Lodox R and stone size (p < 0.001), stone density (p = 0.005), lower body mass index (p = 0.005), and reader (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The high identification rates and low radiation doses of Lodox R make it a promising imaging modality for the diagnosis of ureteral stones.

1032,"Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapeutic approach against lead nitrate- and/or gamma radiation-induced hepatotoxicity Because of the potential regenerative and cytoprotective effects of its content of numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) became an attractive biomaterial for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded
624,"Cerebral computed tomographic angiography using third-generation reconstruction algorithm provides improved image quality with lower contrast and radiation dose PURPOSE: We hypothesized that cerebral CT angiogram performed using third-generation reconstruction algorithm and lower contrast dose-low-kVp technique (LD-CTA) will provide better image quality when compared with regular contrast dose CTA at 120 kVp using a sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithm (ND-CTA)., METHODS: Retrospective imaging review of 100 consecutive patients (50 each in LD- and ND-CTA groups). Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values., RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers. LD-CTA group also used lower contrast (49 cc versus 97 cc in ND-CTA) and had lower radiation exposure (DLP/CTDI for both groups 268.3/80.7 vs 519.5/36.08, both < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Next-generation reconstruction algorithm and low-kV scanning significantly improved image quality on cerebral CTA images despite lower contrast dose and, in addition, have lower radiation exposure.",Excluded

As a guidance tool, US has a number of clear advantages over computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging: fewer false-negative biopsies, lack of ionizing radiation, portability, relatively short procedure time, real-time intra-procedural visualization of the biopsy needle, ability to guide the procedure in almost any anatomic plane, and relatively lower cost. Notably, USPCB is widely used to retrieve tissue specimens in cases of hepatic lesions. However, general radiologists, particularly beginners, find USPCB difficult to perform in abdominal organs other than the liver; indeed, a full understanding of the entire USPCB process and specific considerations for specific abdominal organs is necessary to safely obtain adequate specimens. In this review, we discuss some points and techniques that need to be borne in mind to increase the chances of successful USPCB. We believe that the tips and considerations presented in this review will help radiologists perform USPCB to successfully retrieve target tissue from different organs with minimal complications.",Excluded
1932,"Swimming kinematics and respiratory behaviour of Xenopus laevis larvae raised in altered gravity We examined the respiratory behaviours and swimming kinematics of Xenopus laevis tadpoles hatched in microgravity (Space Shuttle), simulated microgravity (clinostat) and hypergravity (3 g centrifuge). All observations were made in the normal 1 g environment. Previous research has shown that X. laevis raised in microgravity exhibit abnormalities in their lungs and vestibular system upon return to 1 g. The tadpoles raised in true microgravity exhibited a significantly lower tailbeat frequency than onboard 1 g centrifuge controls on the day of landing (day0), but this behaviour normalized within 9 days. The two groups did not differ significantly in buccal pumping rates. Altered buoyancy in the space-flight microgravity tadpoles was indicated by an increased swimming angle on the day after landing (day1). Tadpoles raised in simulated microgravity differed to a greater extent in swimming behaviours from their 1 g controls. The tadpoles raised in hypergravity showed no substantive effects on the development of swimming or respiratory behaviours, except swimming angle. Together, these results show that microgravity has a transient effect on the development of locomotion in X. laevis tadpoles, most notably on swimming angle, indicative of stunted lung development. On the basis of the behaviours we studied, there is no indication of neuromuscular retardation in amphibians associated with embryogenesis in microgravity.",Excluded

As reference, 390 participants with regular heart rates <=65 bpm were used. All participants underwent prospectively electrocardiographically(ECG)-triggered imaging of the coronary arteries using dual source CT at 120kVp, 80 ref mAs using both high-pitch spiral mode and sequential mode. Radiation dose, Agatston score, number of positive scores, as well as median absolute difference of the Agatston score were determined and participants were stratified into CVD risk categories., RESULTS: A similar percentage of participants with low heart rates and high heart rates had a positive CAC score in data sets acquired in high-pitch spiral (low heart rate: 57.7%, high heart rate: 55.8%) and sequential mode (58.0%, 54.7%, p=n.s.). The median absolute difference in Agatston scores between acquisition modes was 14.2% and 9.2%, for the high and low heart rate groups, respectively. Excellent agreement for risk categorization between the two data acquisition modes was found for the high (kappa=0.927) and low (kappa=0.946) heart rate groups. Radiation dose was 48% lower for high-pitch spiral versus sequential acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Radiation dose for the quantification of coronary calcium can be reduced by 48% when using the high-pitch spiral acquisition mode compared to the sequential mode in participants with a regular high heart rate. CVD risk stratification agreement between the two modes of data acquisition is excellent. Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We report the safety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry profiles of (18)F-ICMT-11 in 8 healthy human volunteers., METHODS: (18)F-ICMT-11 was intravenously administered as a bolus injection (mean +/- SD, 159 +/- 2.75 MBq; range, 154-161 MBq) to 8 healthy volunteers (4 men, 4 women). Whole-body (vertex to mid thigh) PET/CT scans were acquired at 6 time points, up to 4 h after tracer injection. Serial whole blood, plasma, and urine samples were collected for radioactivity measurement and radiotracer stability. In vivo (18)F activities were determined from quantitative analysis of the images, and time-activity curves were generated. The total numbers of disintegrations in each organ normalized to injected activity (residence times) were calculated as the area under the curve of the time-activity curve, normalized to injected activities and standard values of organ volumes. Dosimetry calculations were then performed using OLINDA/EXM 1.1., RESULTS: Injection of (18)F-ICMT-11 was well tolerated in all subjects, with no serious tracer-related adverse events reported. The mean effective dose averaged over both men and women was estimated to be 0.025 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq (men, 0.022 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq; women, 0.027 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq). The 5 organs receiving the highest absorbed dose (mGy/MBq), averaged over both men and women, were the gallbladder wall (0.59 +/- 0.44), small intestine (0.12 +/- 0.05), upper large intestinal wall (0.08 +/- 0.07), urinary bladder wall (0.08 +/- 0.02), and liver (0.07 +/- 0.01).

Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudoternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as lipid, Labrasol as surfactant, and Tween 20 as cosurfactant for preparation of self-emulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the phase diagrams and subjected to thermodynamic stability studies and dispersibility tests. The prepared liquid SNEDDS formulations were characterized for viscosity, refractive index, droplet size and zeta potential. The TEM study confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion following dilution of liquid SNEDDS. The optimized liquid SNEDDS were transformed into free flowing granules by adsorption on the porous carriers like Sylysia (350, 550, and 730) and Neusilin TM US2. Solid state characterization employing the FTIR, DSC and powder XRD studies indicated lack of any significant interaction of drug with the lipidic and emulsifying excipients, and porous carriers. In vitro drug release studies indicated faster solubilization of the drug by optimized SSNEGs (over 80% within 30 min) vis-a-vis the pure drug (only 35% within 30 min). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats observed significant increase in C(max) (3.01-fold) and AUC (5.34-fold) using SSNEGs compared to pure drug, whereas no significant difference (p>0.1) was observed with the liquid SNEDDS. Thus, the present studies ratify the bioavailability enhancement potential of SSNEGs of ONH prepared using porous carriers. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3318,"Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients for whom transcatheter arterial chemoembolization was ineffective or unsuitable OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients for whom transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) was ineffective or unsuitable, and to determine whether tumor response and portal vein thrombosis (PVT) response to treatment were prognostic factors for overall survival. METHOD(S): From July 2001 to June 2005, 70 unresectable HCC patients were treated with 3D-CRT; PVT was present in 41 patients. A daily radiation dose ranging from 2 to 3 Gy was administered using 6 or 15 MV x-rays to deliver a total dose between 44 and 54 Gy. RESULT(S): Of 70 patients, follow-up computed tomography showed that primary tumor responses were complete response (CR) in 4 (5.7%) patients, partial response (PR) in 34 (48.6%), no response (NR) in 28 (37.1%), and progressive disease (PD) in 4 (8.6%). Of 41 patients with PVT, PVT responses were CR in 4 (9.7%) patients, PR in 12 (29.3%), NR in 20 (48.8%), and PD in 5 (12.2%). The median survival times were 18.0 and 20.1 month in the primary tumor and the PVT responders (CR + PR), respectively, which were longer than the 6.8 and 7.2 months in the primary tumor and the PVT nonresponders (NR + PD), respectively. CONCLUSION(S): 3D-CRT was associated with a 54.3% objective response rate for primary tumors and a 39.0% objective response rate for PVT. Both primary tumor and PVT responses were found to be prognostic factors for overall survival. The present results suggest 3D-CRT is a practical treatment option in HCC patients for whom TACE is ineffective or unsuitable. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded
483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

1524,"Radiosensitizing effects of miR-18a-5p on lung cancer stem-like cells via downregulating both ATM and HIF-1alpha Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer mortality globally. Most patients received radiotherapy during the course of disease. However, radioresistance generally occurs in the majority of these patients, leading to poor curative effect, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, miR-18a-5p expression was downregulated in irradiated lung cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-18a-5p increased the radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells and inhibited the growth of A549 xenografts after radiation exposure. Dual luciferase report system and miR-18a-5p overexpression identified ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) as the targets of miR-18a-5p. The mRNA and protein expressions of ATM and HIF-1alpha were dramatically downregulated by miR-18a-5p in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, plasma miR-18a-5p expression was significantly higher in radiosensitive than in radioresistant group (P < .001). The cutoff value of miR-18a-5p >2.28 was obtained from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The objective response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in miR-18a-5p-high group than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P < .001). A tendency demonstrated that the median local progression-free survival (PFS) from radiotherapy was longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .082). The median overall survival (OS) from radiotherapy was numerically longer in miR-18a-5p-high than in miR-18a-5p-low group (P = .281). The sensitivity and specificity of plasma miR-18a-5p to predict radiosensitivity was 87% and 95%, respectively. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-18a-5p increases the radiosensitivity in lung cancer cells and CD133+ stem-like cells via downregulating ATM and HIF-1alpha expressions. Plasma miR-18a-5p would be an available indicator of radiosensitivity in lung cancer patients. Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2619,"Reducing computed tomography utilization in the evaluation of renal colic in the emergency department Study Objective: Evaluation of suspected kidney stones make up more than 1 million visits to emergency departments (ED) annually. Renal colic is frequently evaluated with the use of computed tomography (CT), the use of which has greatly increased in recent years. CT for suspected kidney stone has not been shown to improve patient outcomes but is associated with increased exposure to radiation, increased cost and increased ED length of stay. Method(s): In this project, a two-hospital community-based emergency medicine group and the local Regional Collaborative Care Organization (RCCO) began a joint project with the intent to improve the delivery of care to all patients. The goal of our project was to reduce CT imaging in the evaluation of renal colic in the ED to reduce costs, reduce exposure to radiation, and make CT imaging more available for emergent conditions. An educational program was used to support providers in the ED in reduction of total use of CT in the evaluation of patients. This included ultrasound education along with understanding of the cost, radiation exposure and use model for evaluation of suspected renal colic. A monitoring and feedback system was implemented. A care pathway was developed to help with the decisionmaking process and to facilitate a more standardized approach to care. Result(s): All patients seen and evaluated at the two sites were included in the data set. A baseline in utilization was established for all patients from 7/1/14 to 12/31/14. Education and pathways were introduced in the first half of 2015. Data was collected in the same manner for 7/1/15 to 12/31/15. The data was reviewed for individual providers as well as a department as a whole. Data is reported as a number of studies performed per 1000 patients seen for all complaints. The baseline data demonstrated utilization at site #1 at 21.60 and site #2 at 16.45 per 1000 patients. The post implementation data for site #1 is 13.01 and site #2 is 10.40 per 1000 patients. This represents areductionof 40%atsite #1 and 37% at site #2. The combinedresult of the two sites was a reduction from 17.17 to 10.94 per 1000 patients seen or a reduction of 38%. The overall reduction in the six months of data collection was from 1208 total scans to 753 or a change of 455 scans for essentially the same volume of total patients seen in the ED (68,196 base versus 68,804 after). There was a 32% decrease in variability in practice looking at the individuals from baseline to post intervention. RCCO noted a decrease in their financial burden of their patients. In review of the RCCO supported patients comparing the full 2014 year to 2015 there was a reduction in exams for their patient population from 3493 to 2111 or a difference of 1382 (40% decrease). The cost savings to RCCO was $978,602 for that same period. Conclusion(s): The patients received more consistent goal-directed evaluation and care. Patients had a decrease in radiation. The financial burden was decreased. The facility was able to utilize the CT equipment for more timely care of critical patients. The physicians received education and support that will continue to assist in their delivery of care.",Excluded
918,"Concomitant infusional paclitaxel and fluorouracil, oral hydroxyurea, and hyperfractionated radiation for locally advanced squamous head and neck cancer Purpose: To improve local disease control and survival with organ preservation, we conducted a phase II multi-institutional trial with a concomitant taxane-based chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen. Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with locally advanced squamous cancers (stage IV, 98%; N2/3, 81%) were treated on an intensive regimen consisting of 5-day (120-hour) infusions of paclitaxel (20 mg/m2/d) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d), oral hydroxyurea 500 mg every 12 hours for 11 doses, and radiation 1.5 Gy bid (T-FH2X). Chemoradiation was administered concomitantly on days 1 to 5 of each 14-day cycle. A full treatment course consisted of five cycles during a 10-week period to a total radiation dose of 72 to 75 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up for the group is 34 months. At 3 years, progression-free survival is 63%, locoregional control is 86%, and systemic control is 79%; overall survival is 60%. Seventeen patients died of recurrent cancer, two died of second primary cancers, and four died of other causes. Side effects observed include anemia (22% required transfusion), leucopenia (34%, grade 3 to 4), and mucositis (84%, grade 3 to 4). Organ preservation principles were maintained. At 1 year posttreatment, 61% of patients had severe xerostomia and 47% had compromised swallowing. There was little disturbance of speech quality in 97% of patients at the same follow-up point. Conclusion(s): T-FH2X is a highly active and tolerable concomitant chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen that induces sustained local tumor control and holds promise for improved survival with organ preservation in high-risk patients. Identification of less toxic therapy and improved distant disease control are needed. T-FH2X should be tested in a randomized trial and compared with a less intensive concomitant regimen that uses once-daily radiation fractionation. © 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

1697,"Time-dependence of the effect of X-irradiation on the formation of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenases in the developing rat brain X-irradiation (100-1500 r) administered to the heads of rats 8-30 days of age inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (l-glycerol 3-phosphate-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) in the brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery. It is proposed that the inhibition of enzyme formation is related to radiation damage caused to DNA. Actinomycin D inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in a manner similar to ionizing radiation. Four other dehydrogenases also showed age-dependent radiosensitivities. ;Malic enzyme' (EC 1.1.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) ceased to be radiosensitive at about 8 days of age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.42) at 16 days. The correlation between developmental increase in enzyme activity and radiosensitivity held closely for glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase and to a smaller extent for the others.",Included

The difference in pathogenicity between irradiated and non-irradiated populations Babesia bovis parasites attenuated by 35 krads gamma irradiation and parasites not exposed to irradiation, were injected into intact 2-year-old Hereford steers. All five animals receiving non-irradiated blood died but the five animals which received irradiated blood were only mildly affected. Highly significant differences were observed in changes to plasma fibrinogen, serum fibrinogen-like proteins, packed cell volume, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, blood kinins, and plasma kininogen levels in the control animals but non-significant changes in these parameters occurred in the group receiving iradiated blood. Significant changes in the antiplasmin alpha 2M, and the antithrombin levels occurred in control cattle but not in the group receiving irradiated blood. Parasite multiplications rates and maximum parasitaemias were similar in both groups. Irradiation reduced the dose of living parasites from 1 x 10(8) to 2.5 x 10(3), but this was not the reason for the mild reactions. It was concluded that irradiation had selected an avirulent parasite population.",Included

180,"Automatic tube current modulation technique for multidetector CT: is it effective with a 64-detector CT? To investigate whether it is possible to obtain adequate images at uniform image noise levels and reduced radiation exposure with our automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technique for 64-detector CT. The study population consisted of 64 patients with known or suspected lung or abdominal disease. We used a 64-detector CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a combined angular and longitudinal tube current modulation technique (Smart mA, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) to examine 34 patients. The scanning parameters were identical; the minimum and maximum tube current thresholds were 50 and 800 mA, respectively. For study of the constant tube current technique, 30 additional patients were examined at 350 mA. The CT number and image noise (SD of the CT number) were measured in the 64 patients at six levels, i.e., the center of the left ventricle, the liver dome, the porta hepatis, the center of the spleen and the right and left renal pelvis. When we used the ATCM technique, the mean image noise ranged from 8.40 at the center of the left ventricle to 11.31 at the porta hepatis; the mean tube current ranged from 105.9 mAs at the center of the left ventricle to 169.6 mAs at the center of the spleen. The mean dose reduction rate per constant tube current at 175 mAs ranged from 3.1 to 39.5%.

1365,"Effect of X-irradiation on epidermal immune function: decreased density and alloantigen-presenting capacity of Ia+ Langerhans cells and impaired production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) The mechanisms involved in the modulation of cutaneous immune responses by UV radiation have been extensively investigated; by contrast, few studies have addressed the effects of x-irradiation on epidermal immune function. We therefore investigated the effect of x-irradiation of mice on: (a) the density of epidermal Ia+ Langerhans cells (LC) in immunofluorescence studies, (b) epidermal cell (EC) allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic EC-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and (c) production of epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF). C3H/He and BALB/c mice were irradiated with 900, 1,800, 2,700, or 3,600 rad from a 137Cs source, and sacrificed 10 h or 3 days later. X-irradiation of mice 10 h previously only slightly decreased the density of epidermal Ia+ LC and did not affect the capacity of their EC to stimulate allogeneic responder lymphocytes in the ELR. X-irradiation of mice 3 days previously, however, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the density of Ia+ LC. This decrease was accompanied by a substantial reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity in the ELR at all doses of x-irradiation. ETAF production by cultured EC from mice x-irradiated 3 days previously was also found to be diminished at all doses of x-irradiation. Trypan blue exclusion studies demonstrated that the observed decreases in EC allostimulatory capacity and ETAF production were not the result of a generalized lethal effect of x-irradiation on EC. The reduction in EC allostimulatory capacity following in vivo x-irradiation could not be reversed by addition of exogenous ETAF or interleukin-1 in the ELR. Taken together, these results indicate that x-irradiation decreases the density of Ia+ LC, impairs LC alloantigen-presenting function, and reduces ETAF production. Thus cutaneous x-irradiation may affect inflammatory and neoplastic processes not only by its antimitotic activity, but also by a direct effect on EC which subserve immunologic functions.",Included
909,"Evaluation of focal thyroid lesions incidentally detected in F- 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images AIM: Increased uptake in the thyroid gland (TG) is often identified as an incidental finding on whole-body F-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in the non-thyroid cancer (NTC) patients. Currently, there is no consensus on the appropriate approach for management of these cases. Thyroid ultrasound, scintigraphy and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) are suggested to exclude malignant thyroid lesions. Our aim is to determine the importance of increased F-18 FDG uptake in TG on PET/CT in patients who are being screened for various NTC and to recommend a diagnostic strategy to identify patients with high risk of thyroid malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 1086 cases undergoing whole-body PET/CT scan between April 2011 and April 2012. Images with incidental focal FDG uptake in TG were identified. Data of the age, sex, type of primary cancer, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), size of thyroid nodules and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) on F-18 FDG-PET/CT images, and if avalaible, FNAB results were evaluated. RESULT(S): 28 of 1086 patients (2.5%) showed a focal increased F-18 FDG uptake of lesions in TG (14 men, 14 women, mean age+/-SD, 60.29+/-13 years) and the SUVmax value ranged from 1.50 to 18.00 (average SUVmax: 4.19+/-3.41). Thyroid lesions ranged in diameter from 7.0 to 55.0 milimeter (mean+/-SD:16.47+/-11.80mm). The CLN were detected in 11/28 patients (39%). The average SUVmax in CLN was 4.04+/-1.80, the mean CLN diameter was 10.13+/-2.95mm. Twelve of 28 patients (43%) were done FNAB, and the final histopathological diagnosis was malign thyroid nodules in five patient (avarage SUVmax 6.84+/-6.37 and nodule diameter 31.26+/-22.11mm), benign thyroid disease in five patient (avarage SUVmax 3.95+/-1.48 and nodule diameter 9.60+/-2.30mm) and limited and unsufficient materials in two patients. Sixteen patients did not undergo any diagnostic test. CONCLUSION(S): Focal increased FDG uptake in TG incidentally identified on FDG-PET/CT occurred at a frequency of 2.5% and this finding may be associated with an increased risk of malignancy, but the clinical significance is unclear. More data are needed to elucidate the role of SUV in the differentiation of benign and malign thyroid lesions. Clinicians should take into consideration incidentally detected PET/CT findings. Thyroid scintigraphy and, if cold nodule is present, FNAB should be suggested to clinicians for definitive diagnosis.",Excluded
1632,"Countermeasures-based Improvements in Stress, Immune System Dysregulation and Latent Herpesvirus Reactivation onboard the International Space Station - Relevance for Deep Space Missions and Terrestrial Medicine The International Space Station (ISS) has continued to evolve from an operational perspective and multiple studies have monitored both stress and the immune system of ISS astronauts. Alterations were ascribed to a potentially synergistic array of factors, including microgravity, radiation, psychological stress, and circadian misalignment. Comparing similar data across 12 years of ISS construction and operations, we report that immunity, stress, and the reactivation of latent herpesviruses have all improved in ISS astronauts. Major physiological improvements seem to have initiated approximately 2012, a period coinciding with improvements onboard ISS including cargo delivery and resupply frequency, personal communication, exercise equipment and protocols, food quality and variety, nutritional supplementation, and schedule management. We conclude that spaceflight associated immune dysregulation has been positively influenced by operational improvements and biomedical countermeasures onboard ISS. Although an operational challenge, agencies should therefore incorporate, within vehicle design limitations, these dietary, operational, and stress-relieving countermeasures into deep space mission planning. Specific countermeasures that have benefited astronauts could serve as a therapy augment for terrestrial acquired immunodeficiency patients.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
534,"Post-remission treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukaemia: A time-dependent analysis Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. Method(s): For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. Finding(s): 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Interpretation(s): Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

2205,"Hybrid resistance to parental bone marrow grafts in nonlethally irradiated mice Resistance to parental bone marrow (BM) grafts in F1 hybrid recipients is due to natural killer (NK) cell-mediated rejection triggered through ""missing self"" recognition. ""Hybrid resistance"" has usually been investigated in lethally irradiated F1 recipients in conjunction with pharmacological activation of NK cells. Here, we investigated BM-directed NK-cell alloreactivity in settings of reduced conditioning. Nonlethally irradiated (1-3 Gy) or nonirradiated F1 (C57BL6 x BALB/c) recipient mice received titrated doses (5-20 x 106) of unseparated parental BALB/c BM without pharmacological NK cell activation. BM successfully engrafted in all mice and multilineage donor chimerism persisted long-term (24 weeks), even in the absence of irradiation. Chimerism was associated with the rearrangement of the NK-cell receptor repertoire suggestive of reduced reactivity to BALB/c. Chimerism levels were lower after transplantation with parental BALB/c than with syngeneic F1 BM, indicating partial NK-mediated rejection of parental BM. Activation of NK cells with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt poly(I:C), reduced parental chimerism in nonirradiated BM recipients but did not prevent hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. In contrast, equal numbers of parental lymph node cells were completely rejected. Hence, hybrid resistance leads to incomplete rejection of parental BM under reduced conditioning settings.Copyright © 2018 The Authors American Journal of Transplantation published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons",Excluded

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of differing light doses. Patients with HGD in BE received oral ALA (60 mg/kg) activated by low (500 J/cm), medium (750 J/cm), high (1,000 J/cm), or highest (1,000 J/cm x2) light dose at 635 nm. Follow-up was by regular endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies. Twenty-four patients were treated. Successful eradication of HGD was significantly correlated with light dose (log rank, p < 0.01). Six of eight patients (75%) treated with the highest light dose, one of two treated with high dose (50%), two of nine (22%) receiving medium light dose, and zero of five receiving low light dose had successful eradication of HGD (median follow-up 45 months, range 1-78 months). No skin photosensitivity or esophageal strictures occurred. The efficacy of ALA-PDT for eradication of HGD in BE is closely related to the light dose used. With a drug dose of 60 mg/kg and light at 635 nm, we recommend a minimum light dose of 1,000 J/cm of esophagus. This dose appears safe.",Excluded

It is featured with swelling, redness, itching, pain, breaks in skin, discomfort, and a burning sensation. There is a lack of convincing evidence supporting any single practice in the prevention or management of RISR., METHODS/DESIGNS: This double-blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin (as known as Moogoo Udder Cream R) versus aqueous cream in reducing RISR, improving pain, itching and quality of life in this patient group. One group will receive Moogoo Udder Cream R. Another group will receive aqueous cream. Outcome measures will be collected using patient self-administered questionnaire, interviewer administered questionnaire and clinician assessment at commencement of radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Despite advances of radiologic advances and supportive care, RISR are still not well managed. There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream R may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim.

Data sources Retrospective case series comparing hearing outcomes of patients with a unilateral vestibular schwannoma managed conservatively or with stereotactic radiotherapy in a tertiary care academic centre. Review methods Patients: Tumor database patients with American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Class A or B hearing at the onset of study. Stereotactic radiotherapy patients were predominantly those who failed conservative management. Intervention(s): Audiometric pure tone averages and speech discrimination scores as well as patient demographics, tumor location, size and growth were extracted. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hearing outcome measures were: 1) Hearing Preservation, i.e. no drop from Class A/B to Class C/D hearing, 2) Hearing Survival of Class A/B hearing in months, 3) Audiometric Pure Tone Averages, Difference between post-treatment and pre-treatment, and 4) Speech Discrimination Score Difference (pre-treatment - post treatment). Survival analysis and non-parametric tests were used for hearing outcome measures, with multiple covariates tested. Results Overall, serviceable hearing preservation among the 123 patients was 51%. The median hearing survival time was 46 months (mean 59 months). The Pure Tone averages and Speech Discrimination score differences were 16 dB and 82% respectively over a median follow-up time of 43 months. No significant difference was found between the conservative and SRT groups in any hearing outcome. Class A patients showed far better hearing survival than Class B patients. Conclusions No significant difference was demonstrated as to measures of hearing outcomes between stereotactic radiotherapy and conservative management. Excellent existing hearing appears to be the best predictor of long term hearing survival in the cohort studied.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Cases were those diagnosed with lung cancer over 6 years of follow-up (n = 108). Two controls, matched on age and sex, were selected for each case by incidence density sampling. Of the three polymorphisms, only the XRCC1 Arg280His allele was associated with increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) after adjustment for radon and tobacco exposure. In addition, individuals with the variant Arg280His allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at higher risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype. Conversely, individuals with the variant Arg194Trp allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at lower risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype. Polymorphisms of XRCC1 appear to influence risk of lung cancer and may modify risk attributable to environmental exposures.",Excluded
2916,"Genomic characterization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in radiation-exposed Chornobyl cleanup workers Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. Method(s): A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
468,"The tumor-stroma ratio is an independent predictor for survival in nasopharyngeal cancer Background: The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) has been identified as a new and practicable prognostic histological characteristic of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the TSR in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 93 patients who presented with NPC from 2004 to 2007 were studied. Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy was administered according to their Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages. The TSR was assessed visually on hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of biopsy specimens by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 66.67% and 54.91%, respectively, in the stroma-poor group and 40.48% and 33.33%, respectively, in the stroma-rich group. Both the 5-year OS and DFS rates in the stroma-poor group were significantly better than those in the stroma-rich group (p < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis, the TSR was identified as a highly significant prognostic factor for the 5-year OS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.999; p = 0.030) and the 5-year DFS (HR 1.925; p = 0.042). Conclusion(s): Stroma-rich tumors were associated with poor prognosis and an increased risk of relapse, which may serve as a new prognostic histological characteristic in NPC.Copyright © 2014 S.

24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm. So, all patients with head and neck malignancy should undergo an oral examination before the initiation of cancer therapy with adequate prophylaxis.",Excluded
649,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included
501,"Organ biodistribution of Germanium-68 in rat in the presence and absence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC for the extrapolation to the human organ and whole-body radiation dosimetry Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in particular gallium-68 (68Ga) applications are growing exponentially worldwide contributing to the expansion of nuclear medicine and personalized management of patients. The significance of 68Ga utility is reflected in the implementation of European Pharmacopoeia monographs. However, there is one crucial point in the monographs that might limit the use of the generators and consequently expansion of 68Ga applications and that is the limit of 0.001% of Germanium-68 (68Ge(IV)) radioactivity content in a radiophar-maceutical. We have investigated the organ distribution of 68Ge(IV) in rat and estimated human dosimetry parameters in order to provide experimental evidence for the determination and justification of the 68Ge(IV) limit. Male and female rats were injected in the tail vein with formulated [68Ge]GeCl4 in the absence or presence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. The tissue radioactivity distribution data was extrapolated for the estimation of human organ equivalent doses and total effective dose using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM). 68Ge(IV) was evenly distributed among the rat organs and fast renal excretion prevailed. Human organ equivalent dose and total effective dose estimates indicated that the kidneys were the dose-limiting organs (185+/-54 muSv/MBq for female and 171+/-38 muSv/MBq for male) and the total effective dose was 15.5+/-0.1 and 10.7+/-1.2 muSv/MBq, respectively for female and male. The results of this dosimetry study conclude that the 68Ge(IV) limit currently recommended by monographs could be increased considerably (>100 times) without exposing the patient to harm given the small absorbed doses to normal organs and fast excretion.",Excluded
2061,"Impacts of ionising radiation on sperm quality, DNA integrity and post-fertilisation development in marine and freshwater crustaceans Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

2261,"Head and neck radiotherapy does not increase gelatinase (metalloproteinase-2 and -9) expression or activity in teeth irradiated in vivo OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

1242,"Collaborative exercise on the use of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective biodosimetry of Mayak nuclear-industrial personnel PURPOSE: To investigate within the framework of a multilaboratory study the suitability of FISH chromosome painting to measure so-called stable translocations in peripheral lymphocytes of Mayak nuclear-industrial workers (from the Southern Urals) and their use for retrospective biodosimetry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chromosime analyses were carried out from 69 workers who had received protracted occupational radiation exposures (0.012-6.065 Gy) up to approximately 40 years before blood sampling. Twenty-one unexposed people living in the same area were controls. A multicolour FISH-painting protocol with the target chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 simultaneously with a pancentromeric probe was used to score potentially transmissible chromosome-type aberrations (reciprocal translocations 2B and related 'one-way' patterns I-III according to the S&S classification)., RESULTS: Individual biodosimetry estimates were obtained in terms of these potentially long-term surviving aberration types based on the linear component of a low dose-rate gamma-ray calibration curve produced using identical staining and scoring protocols. For comparison, the workers personal and total background doses were converted to red bone marrow doses. The estimated doses were mainly lower than would be predicted by the calibration curve, particularly at accumulated higher dose levels., CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the limited life-time of circulating T-lymphocytes, the long-term persistence of translocations in vivo requires the assumption of a clonal repopulation of these naturally senescing cells from the haemopoietic stem cell compartments. Obviously such a replacement cannot be fully achieved, leading to a temporal decline even of the yield of transmissible aberrations types. Assuming further a highly selective capacity of stem cells against any type of chromosomal damage and the fact that one must rely on partial genome findings, the potential of FISH chromosome painting for retrospective dose reconstruction is probably limited to a decade or so after high-level protracted radiation exposure.",Included
2607,"Minimal erythema dose after multiple UV exposures depends on pre-exposure skin pigmentation BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Phototherapy consists of multiple ultraviolet (UV) exposures. Most previous studies have focused on erythema following a single UV exposure in fair-skinned persons. Although it is well known that phototherapy lowers the daily UV-threshold dose for erythema in clinical practice, this is insufficiently documented under controlled experimental conditions. The purpose of this study was to quantify the change in the daily threshold for a dose specific erythema grade after 1-4 consecutive daily UV exposures., METHODS: Forty-nine healthy volunteers (skin type II-V) with varying pigmentation quantified by skin reflectance. Two UV sources were used: a narrowband UVB (Philips TL01) and a Solar Simulator (Solar Light Co.). Just perceptible erythema after 24 h was chosen as the minimal erythema dose (+); besides + and ++ were assessed., RESULTS: We found a positive and significant exponential relationship between skin pigmentation and UV dose to elicit a specific erythema grade on the back after 1-4 UV exposures. After repetitive UV exposures the UV dose had to be lowered more in dark-skinned persons compared with fair-skinned persons to elicit a certain erythema grade. This applied to both UV sources and all erythema grades., CONCLUSION: In the dark-skinned persons the daily UV dose after the 4 days UV exposure should be lowered by 40-50% to avoid burns compared with the single UV exposure. For the most fair-skinned persons essentially no reduction in the daily UV dose was needed. Our results indicate that the pre-exposure pigmentation level can guide the UV dosage in phototherapy.",Excluded

PEM synergizes with ionizing radiation and CIS in preclinical models. PEM+CIS doublets showed efficacy and favourable toxicity profiles in Phase I/II studies of NS-NSCLC. This singlearm multicenter Phase II study investigated efficacy and safety of PEM+CIS induction followed by full-dose PEM+CIS plus concurrent RT in pts with LA NS-NSCLC. Material(s) and Method(s): Pts with unresectable Stage IIIA/IIIB NS-NSCLC, ECOG performance status (PS) 0-1 and forced expiratory volume (FEV) >50% of predicted normal FEV received two 21-day cycles of PEM 500 mg/m2 + CIS 75 mg/m2 on Day 1. Pts who had not progressed, had no residual neurological toxicity >Grade(G) 2, PS 0-1 and lung V20 <35% then received 2 cycles of the same full-dose PEM+CIS regimen plus concurrent thoracic RT of 2 Gy/fraction, 5d/wk for 7wks (66 Gy total). All pts received vitamin supplementation/dexamethasone prophylaxis as per PEM-label. Primary endpoint was the 1 yr progression-free survival (PFS) rate. A minimum of 53 events was required to provide 90% power to demonstrate an improvement of the 1 yr PFS rate from 45% (historical data) to 60% at a 2-sided alpha level of 5%, resulting in a sample size of 88 pts assuming 10% dropouts. Secondary data presented include tumor response and toxicity. Result(s): 90 pts were enrolled in 4 countries: median age 61 yrs, male/ female 57%/43%, ECOG PS 0/1 66%/34%, mean (SD) FEV 2.3 (0.62)L, adenocarcinoma 90%, Stage IIIA/IIIB 36%/62% (2 pts had Stage IV and discontinued before starting RT). 75 pts (83.3%) completed induction CT and started concurrent CT+RT. 63 of the 75 pts (84.0%) received all 4 CT cycles and full RT of 66 Gy. Median PEM+CIS dose intensities were >97% during concurrent CT+RT, median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 18-66 Gy). The 1 yr PFS rate was 51.3% (95% CI 42.0-60.5). After a median follow-up of 24 months, median PFS was 10.6 months (95% CI 8.6-17.3). Response data are shown as table. One pt died from study-drug related toxicity (enteritis) during Cycle 4. Four pts discontinued due to non-fatal drug- or radiation related adverse events, 1 on induction CT (renal failure), 3 on concurrent CT+RT (hypoacusis, 2x radiation esophagitis). During induction CT, 18.9% of pts reported G3/4 CTCAEs, only neutropenia (2.2%) and syncope (2.2%) were reported by >1 pt. During concurrent CT+RT, 41.3% of 75 pts reported G3/4 CTCAEs, mainly esophagitis (12.0%), neutropenia (10.7%) and leukopenia (9.3%). One pt experienced G3 mucositis and 1 pt showed G3 acute pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): In this study of PEM+CIS induction followed by full-dose PEM+CIS with concurrent thoracic RT, the 1 yr PFS rate (51.3%) was in the same range as previously observed with other CIS-based induction CT followed by CT+RT (40-50%). Of note, 7 pts had CR. Main G3/4 toxicities during concurrent CT+RT included esophagitis, neutropenia and leukopenia. (Table presented).",Excluded
2512,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the p53 pathway A cell culture assay has been developed that detects and validates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that populate the p53 pathway. One hundred thirteen EBV-transformed human B-lymphocyte cell lines obtained from a diverse population were employed to measure the apoptotic response to gamma radiation. Each cell line undergoes a reproducible, characteristic frequency of apoptosis, and the response of the population forms a normal distribution around a median of 35.5% apoptosis with a range from 12% to 58% apoptosis. Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and Perp genes significantly affect the frequency of apoptosis. The assay can detect both racial and sexual dimorphisms in these genes and has the ability to demonstrate epistatic relationships within the p53 pathway.

2289,"Radiation exposure to the surgeon during open lumbar microdiscectomy and minimally invasive microdiscectomy: A prospective, controlled trial Study Design.: This is a prospective in vivo study comparing radiation exposure to the surgeon during 10 minimally invasive lumbar microdiscectomy cases with 10 traditional open discectomy cases as a control. Objective.: Radiation exposure to the eye, chest, and hand of the operating surgeon during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and open lumbar microdiscectomy were measured. The Occupational Exposure Guidelines were used to calculate the allowable number of cases per year from the mean values at each of the 3 sites. Summary of Background Data.: Fluoroscopy is a source of ionizing radiation and as such, is a potential health hazard with continued exposure during surgery. Presently, radiation exposure to the surgeon during MIS lumbar microdiscectomy is unknown. Methods.: Radiation exposure to the surgeon (millirads [mR]) per case was measured by digital dosimeters placed at the level of the thyroid/eye, chest, and dominant forearm. Other data collected included operative side and level, side of the surgeon, side of the x-ray source, total fluoroscopy time, and energy output. Results.: The average radiation exposure to the surgeon during open cases was thyroid/eye 0.16 +/- 0.22 mR, chest 0.21 +/- 0.23 mR, and hand 0.20 +/- 0.14 mR. During minimally invasive cases exposure to the thyroid/eye was 1.72 +/- 1.52 mR, the chest was 3.08 +/- 2.93 mR, and the hand was 4.45 +/- 3.75 mR. The difference between thyroid/ eye, chest, and hand exposure during open and minimally invasive cases was statistically significant (P = 0.010, P = 0.013, and P = 0.006, respectively). Surgeons standing in an adjacent substerile room during open cases were exposed to 0.2 mR per case. Conclusion.: MIS lumbar microdiscectomy cases expose the surgeon to significantly more radiation than open microdiscectomy. One would need to perform 1623 MIS microdiscectomies to exceed the exposure limit for whole-body radiation, 8720 cases for the lens of the eye, and 11,235 cases for the hand. Standing in a substerile room during x-ray localization in open cases is not fully protective. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

3057,"Narrow-band ultraviolet B radiation induces the expression of beta-endorphin in human skin in vivo BACKGROUND: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun and solaria has addictive properties that may develop into dependence. In mice, UVR addiction was connected to beta-endorphin (beta-END) formed in the skin after UVR exposure. In humans, the formation of beta-END in skin keratinocytes has not been confirmed in vivo., OBJECTIVE: To determine with immunohistochemistry if sub-erythematous narrow-band UV-B (NB-UV-B) exposures stimulate p53 mediated expression of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), beta-END and alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) in human skin keratinocytes in vivo., METHODS: Within 12 healthy volunteers, 7 received a single 1 standard erythema dose (SED) of NB-UV-B on their whole body, and 5 volunteers received a cumulative dose of 3 SED delivered on two subsequent days i.e., 1+2 SED. Skin biopsies were taken immediately before the first exposure and at 24h from the last UV-B exposure to assess p53, beta-END, POMC, and alpha-MSH expression., RESULTS: Nuclear p53 expression increased in all samples taken at 24h after NB-UV-B exposure. UV-B irradiation also increased epidermal beta-END expression in 11 out of 12 samples taken at 24h after UV-B exposure. The brownish staining was localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes and around the nuclei, being more pronounced in the basal cell layers. POMC and alpha-MSH staining showed no obvious meaningful increase since only one section of each showed any change compared with basal levels., CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that UV-B exposures increase beta-END expression in epidermal keratinocytes of human skin in vivo, which could be the link to proposed UVR addiction.

Patients were separated in two groups: patients affected by mucositis (MUCOSITIS) and patient without mucositis (NO MUCOSITIS). All patients were divided in function of the anticancer treatment: patients who had radiotherapy (MUCOSITIS RADIO), had not radiotherapy (MUCOSITIS NO RADIO), had chemotherapy (MUCOSITIS CHEMO), and those who had not chemotherapy (MUCOSITIS NO CHEMO). Statistical evaluation PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was conducted with the software BIO-RAD Data Manager( TM) (Version 3.5)., RESULTS: We found the increased peaks of 3443, 3487, and 4135 m/z in MUCOSITIS group, while 6237 m/z was reduced. These same peaks would the same modifications in MUCOSITIS RADIO, while in MUCOSITIS CHEMIO are increased 3443 and 6237 m/z but 3487, 4135 m/z are reduced. These data were confirmed by the PCA., CONCLUSION: Anticancer therapy influenced the level expression of many salivary biomarkers in mucositis with a good significance. Therefore, 3443, 3487, 4135, and 6237 m/z are good biomarker candidates of oral mucositis. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded

The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010 This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included

Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy.

3090,"Measurement uncertainties in whole body counting and radon progeny Measurement uncertainty is an important quality index in gamma spectrometry related to the level of bias and precision involved in the measuring procedure. Quality control measurements during the commissioning of a 16-input whole body counter showed substantial deviations between the experimentally determined precision and the theoretical estimation, indicating either equipment malfunction or lack of reproducibility of the experimental setup. In this study, the role of the magnitude and variability of airborne background radiation present in the counting room and the human body in the deterioration of the precision of counters employing NaI(Tl) detectors was investigated. Correction methods and actions based on case-specific background features were developed and applied. The experimental observations were benchmarked using a mathematical model of the counter. The efficacy of the developed methods was tested by measurements, and updated precision values were obtained. Quasi-equilibrium between the gamma-emitters Bi and 222Pb in the counting room and the human body is a prerequisite for accurate direct low-level radioactivity measurements in the human body. © 2014 Health Physics Society.",Excluded

567,"Clinical trial of chemotherapy by superselective intra-arterial infusion of nedaplatin (CDGP) and 5-FU with concurrent radiotherapy for advanced oral cancer Nedaplatin (CDGP) is one of the platinum-derivatives to further improve the anti-tumor effect and to reduce adverse effects of cisplatin, such as renal toxicity. The present study evaluated the efficacy and adverse events of chemotherapy by superselective intra-arterial infusion of CDGP and 5-FU combined with concurrent radiotherapy in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. Sixteen patients were treated with CDGP plus 5-FU in combination with concurrent irradiation of 40.60 Gy. Ten patients were treated as a preoperative therapy and 6 as a definitive therapy. The overall clinical response rate was 93.8% and histological effects according to the grading system of Shimosato et al. were seen in 13/16 (81.2%). Adverse events were observed in all patients. Mucositis, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (>Grade 2) were seen in 13 (81.3%), 11 (68.8%) and 8 (50.0%) of 16 patients, respectively. The overall 2-year and 4 months survival rate was 86.2%. One patient have died of disease and another of other causes. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy using CDGP plus 5-FU was tolerated with good clinical and histological effects,resulting in good local control for advanced oral carcinoma.",Excluded
2670,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included
2643,"Dosimetric analysis and clinical outcomes in CT-based mould brachytherapy in early oral cancers in patients unfit for surgery Purpose: Brachytherapy in the oral cavity is an important alternative to conventional treatment, and provides a high localized dose and short overall treatment time. A rapid fall of dose beyond radioactive source makes it possible for increased tumour control and sparing surrounding tissue, while short overall treatment duration reduces risk of tumour repopulation. Moulds are fabricated to hold the catheters in position as closely as possible to tumour surface to provide adequate dose coverage of tumour volume and increase distance to other normal surrounding structures. Image based planning and dose optimisation help in better defining target volume and dose coverage. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis of patients of early squamous cell carcinomas of lip and buccal mucosa from September 2011 to June 2014 to study response to mould brachytherapy. Double plane moulds were prepared for all lip cancer cases and single plane for buccal mucosa cases. Patients are being followed up till disease recurrence. In this study evaluation was done of the technique used, planning details, response to therapy, and reactions encountered. Result(s): Nine patients treated by mould therapy were reviewed; seven cases were of lip and two of buccal mucosal cancers. Dose delivered ranged from 12.5-48 Gy in fraction sizes of 2.5-3.5 Gy. Equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) ranged from 18-64 Gy. Maximum dose to organs at risk (OAR) was 91% of prescribed dose. Local mucositis was only reaction in all cases, which resolved in 3-6 weeks. Median follow-up was 19 months. Eight out of nine patients are in remission at a minimum of 7 months (1 case, rest over 14 months) post therapy and only one patient had nodal recurrence at 18 months. Conclusion(s): Mould therapy is an effective treatment method for selected early and superficial squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, although indications are limited.Copyright © 2015, Termedia Publishing House Ltd.

1866,"Hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To analyze the possible correlation between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance of acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity., METHODS: We prospectively studied hemoglobin levels and acute radiotherapy-induced toxicity in 86 patients treated for 3 months. Both sexes were considered to have anemia if their hemoglobin level was < or = 12 g/dL. No patient received corrective treatment for hemoglobin levels. Acute toxicity was analyzed weekly during radiotherapy and 45 days after therapy ended. The possible relationship between anemia and toxicity was analyzed, as was the correlation between hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity., RESULTS: The findings were similar for all prognostic factors in patients with and without anemia. Hemoglobin concentration was < or = 12 g/dL in 24 patients (27.9%; mean, 10.93 +/- 0.78 g/dL). At the end of radiotherapy, hemoglobin levels were < or = 12 g/dL in 18 patients (20.9%; mean, 11.26 +/- 1.06 g/dL). The correlation between pretherapy and posttherapy hemoglobin concentration was significant at r = 0.729 (P = 0.01). The correlation between absolute hemoglobin values and the degree of toxicity, and the possible relationship between hemoglobin concentration and the appearance or the degree of toxicity after radiotherapy, was not significant., CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation of the tumor and healthy tissues was not linear. This may account for the influence of hemoglobin levels on control of the disease as reported in earlier studies, but it does not account for their influence on acute toxicity after radiotherapy.",Excluded
3405,"Body mass index associated with onset and progression of osteoarthritis of the knee but not of the hip: The Rotterdam Study Objective: To investigate the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and the incidence and progression of radiological knee as well as of radiological hip osteoarthritis. Design(s): Cohort study. Setting(s): Population based. Participant(s): 3585 people aged >=55 years were selected from the Rotterdam Study, on the basis of the availability of radiographs of baseline and follow-up. Main Outcome Measure(s): Incidence of knee or hip osteoarthritis was defined as minimally grade 2 at follow-up and grade 0 or 1 at baseline. The progression of osteoarthritis was defined as a decrease in joint space width. Method(s): x Rays of the knee and hip at baseline and follow-up (mean follow-up of 6.6 years) were evaluated. BMI was measured at baseline. Result(s): A high BMI (>27 kg/m2) at baseline was associated with incident knee osteoarthritis (odds ratio (OR) 3.3), but not with incident hip osteoarthritis. A high BMI was also associated with progression of knee osteoarthritis (OR 3.2). For the hip, a significant association between progression of osteoarthritis and BMI was not found. Conclusion(s): On the basis of these results, we conclude that BMI is associated with the incidence and progression of knee osteoarthritis. Furthermore, it seems that BMI is not associated with the incidence and progression of hip osteoarthritis.",Excluded
633,"Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester county, Massachusetts A study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure and its radioactive progeny was performed with 200 cases (58% male, 42% female) and 397 controls matched on age and sex, all from the same health maintenance organization. Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included
1230,"Posterior keyhole corpectomy with percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization in the surgical management of lumbar burst fractures OBJECTIVE: The authors present a new method of minimally invasive surgical management of lumbar burst fractures through the posterior approach. The method includes minimally invasive corpectomy and interbody fusion, both of which are performed through a keyhole approach, and percutaneous pedicle screw fixation of the fracture. The technique of the posterior keyhole corpectomy presented in this report is a novel and original concept of the first author (AM). The percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization is performed with the use of a percutaneous instrumentation system (Sextant; Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). The Sextant system has been dedicated and used in nontrauma degenerative cases; the novel aspect of this system is its application in spine fractures. Indications for the method include Denis classification subtype B or Magerl subtype A.3.1 burst fractures. Both subtypes represent fractures with failure and retropulsion of the upper part of the vertebral body. METHOD(S): The clinical experience of this study includes four cases of burst fractures with significant retropulsion and occlusion of the spinal canal. Long-term results were assessed at a minimum follow-up period of 1 year (maximum, 3.5 yr). The follow-up assessments included: 1) the quality of decompression and reconstruction of the spinal canal (computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scanning); 2) the stability of the operated segment (dynamic x-rays); 3) the quality of interbody fusion (computed tomographic scanning and dynamic x-rays); and 4) correction of the fracture kyphosis and its postoperative loss (measurements of Cobb angles for the assessment of sagittal plane deformity). The minimum armamentarium requirements for this method include a typical micro lumbar discectomy retractor set; a surgical microscope; two-plane intraoperative fluoroscopy; and a system for percutaneous pedicle screw stabilization (Sextant). ""Posterior keyhole corpectomy"" indicates corpectomy of the posterior upper half of the vertebral body or removal of the retropulsed bone fragment via two keyhole skin incisions on both sides of the spinous process (each skin incision measures 2 to 3 cm long). Exposure of the retropulsed fragment (the posterior upper part of the vertebral body) is achieved by medial or complete facetectomy along with complete or medial resection of the pedicle. This has to be performed bilaterally. Percutaneous stabilization requires four additional stab skin incisions. RESULT(S): We observed no surgery-related complications (neurological, hardware, dural tears, or deep or superficial wound infections); there was perfect decompression and clearance of the spinal canal (confirmed by computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scanning); and there was solid stability at the affected segments (confirmed by dynamic x-rays). Healed fusion was noted in all patients but one. The latter patient had no clinical symptoms of spinal instability. Kyphotic deformity was corrected and reversed into lordosis in three patients. Loss of deformity correction was noted in all patients; however, all patients retained lordotic alignment of the affected segment. CONCLUSION(S): The advantages of this method include sparing the posterior elements (lamina, spinous process, supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, and paravertebral muscles), safety of the decompression provided by the use of a surgical microscope, and perfect illumination of the operating field. The drawbacks of the method include limitation to certain types of burst fractures, the method is surgically demanding, and the method requires development of a special retractor system to eliminate the cumbersome alternate insertion and the reinsertions of the typical microdiscectomy retractor set.

690,"Comparison of Machine Learning Optimal Classification Trees With the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma Decision Rules Importance: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the standard for the rapid diagnosis of intracranial injury, but it is costly and exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules for identifying children with minor head trauma who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) are widely used to triage CT imaging. Objective: To examine whether optimal classification trees (OCTs), which are novel machine-learning classifiers, improve on PECARN rules' predictive accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of prospective, publicly available data on emergency department visits for head trauma used by the PECARN group to develop their tool was conducted to derive OCT-based prediction rules for ciTBI in a development cohort and compare their predictive performance vs the PECARN rules in a validation cohort among children who were younger than 2 years and 2 years or older. Data on 42412 children with head trauma and without severely altered mental status who were examined between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, were gathered from 25 emergency departments in North America participating in PECARN. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2016, to December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was ciTBI, with predictive performance measured by estimating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the OCT and the PECARN rules. The OCT and PECARN rules' performance was compared by estimating ratios for each measure. Results: Of the 42412 children (15 996 [37.7%] girls) included in the analysis, 10718 were younger than 2 years (25.3%; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [0.6] months) and 31694 were 2 years or older (74.7%; age, 9.1 [4.9] years). Compared with PECARN rules, OCTs misclassified 0 vs 1 child with ciTBI in the younger and 10 vs 9 children with ciTBI in the older cohort, and correctly identified more children with very low risk of ciTBI in the younger (7605 vs 5701) and older (20 594 vs 18 134) cohorts. In the validation cohorts, compared with the PECARN rules, the OCTs had statistically significantly better specificity (in the younger cohort: 69.3%; 95% CI, 67.4%-71.2% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 50.8%-54.9%; in the older cohort: 65.6%; 95% CI, 64.5%-66.8% vs 57.6%; 95% CI, 56.4%-58.8%), positive predictive value (odds ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively), and positive likelihood ratio (risk ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio between the 2 sets of rules. Conclusions and Relevance: If implemented, OCTs may help reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans, without missing more patients with ciTBI than the PECARN rules.",Excluded
2979,"Significant correlations between human cortical bone mineral density and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) obtained with 3D Cones ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI) PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI is a tool that can characterize changes in susceptibility, an intrinsic property which is associated with compositional changes in the tissue. Current QSM estimation of cortical bone is challenging because conventional clinical MRI cannot acquire signal in cortical bone. This study aimed to implement Cones 3D ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) for ex vivo QSM measurements in human tibial cortical bone, investigating the correlations of QSM with volumetric intracortical bone mineral density (BMD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine tibial midshaft cortical bone specimens (25mm long specimens cut at the mid-point of tibial shaft, 67+/-20years old, 5 women and 4 men) were scanned on a clinical 3T MRI scanner for QSM measurement. The specimens were also scanned on a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner for volumetric BMD estimation. QSM and muCT results were compared at approximately nine regions of interest (ROIs) per specimen., RESULTS: Average 3D UTE-MRI QSM showed significantly strong correlation with volumetric BMD (R=-0.82, P<0.01) and bone porosity (R=0.72, P<0.01). Combining all data points together (77 ROIs), QSM showed significant moderate to strong correlation with volumetric BMD after correction for interdependencies in specimens (R=-0.70, P<0.01). The corrections were required because the data points were not independent in each specimen. Similarly, the correlation between QSM and porosity was significant (R=0.68, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Cones 3D UTE-MRI QSM technique can potentially serve as a novel and accurate tool to assess intracortical bone mineral density whilst avoiding ionizing radiation.

1215,"Self-generated lower body negative pressure exercise Background: Exercise during spaceflight helps prevent musculoskeletal and cardiovascular deconditioning to Earth gravity. This report evaluates the aerobic and anaerobic exercise stimulus provided by self-generated lower body negative pressure. Method(s): A lower body negative pressure cylinder expands and collapses longitudinally, but not radially. As the legs push footward to expand the cylinder, the air pressure in the cylinder decreases, increasing the force required to continue expanding the cylinder. In addition, valves control air flow into and out of the cylinder, and thus workload. In seven supine subjects, knee bend exercise was performed at 19 cycles per minute for 6 min. Footward force was measured with load cells, cylinder pressure with a transducer, heart rate from ECG, and oxygen consumption with turbine volumetry and gas analysis. Result(s): Maximum footward force at the peak of the exercise cycle averaged 1120 +/- 88 N (114 +/- 9 kg), and pressure within the cylinder concomitantly decreased 26 +/- 3 mmHg below ambient. Heart rate and oxygen consumption increased 75 +/- 4 bpm and 26.3 +/- 1.4 m O2/kg . min-1 from supine resting values, respectively. Conclusion(s): With the air inlet valve nearly closed, exercise with this device approximates a resistance-type leg press. With more inflow of air, more rapid, aerobic knee bends can be performed. This exercise device/concept provides simultaneous dynamic musculoskeletal and cardiovascular stresses without an external power source.",Excluded

The following BMI-adapted contrast material protocol was used for imaging of 70 consecutively registered patients: BMI < 17.5, 50 mL contrast material at 4.0 mL/s; 17.5-22.4, 55 mL at 4.0 mL/s; 22.5-24.9, 65 mL at 4.0 mL/s; 25.0-27.4, 80 mL at 4.5 mL/s; 27.5-29.9, 80 mL at 5.0 mL/s; 30.0-34.9, 85 mL at 5.0 mL/s; 35.0-40.0, 95 mL at 5.0 mL/s; > 40, 105 mL at 5.0 mL/s. Seventy patients matched for BMI who had previously undergone routine coronary CT angiography with a fixed contrast material dosage of 80 mL at 5 mL/s served as the reference group. Vessel attenuation in the left main and proximal right coronary arteries was measured and correlated with BMI, and the results in the two protocol groups were compared., RESULTS: The groups were well matched for BMI. The mean BMI in the nonadapted protocol group was 26.5 +/- 4.0 (standard deviation) (range, 18.9-36.5), and that in the BMI-adapted protocol group was 26.7 +/- 4.2 (range, 18.2-37.2) (p not significant). The mean amount of contrast material used was smaller in the BMI-adapted group (73.9 +/- 11.2 vs 80.0 +/- 0 mL; p < 0.01). Mean coronary artery attenuation did not differ significantly between the two groups (386 +/- 102 HU vs 385 +/- 64 HU; p not significant). Without BMI adaptation, coronary attenuation correlated strongly with BMI (r = -0.63; p < 0.001). With the BMI-adapted protocol, however, there was no correlation between BMI and coronary attenuation (r = -0.24; p not significant)., CONCLUSION: We validated a BMI-adapted contrast material protocol that results in adequate coronary vessel attenuation independent of individual BMI despite a significant reduction in overall amount of contrast material used.",Excluded

The technique is also used for routine monitoring of occupationally exposed workers to determine radiation exposure. An in vitro irradiation study of human peripheral blood lymphocytes was conducted to establish a dose-response curve for radiation-induced dicentric aberrations. Blood samples were collected from volunteer donors and together with optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and were irradiated at 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, and 6 Gy using a cobalt-60 radiotherapy unit. Blood samples were cultured for 48 h, and the metaphase chromosomes were prepared following the procedure of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Emergency Preparedness and Response - Biodosimetry 2011 manual. At least 100 metaphases were scored for dicentric aberrations at each dose point. The data were analyzed using R language program. The results indicated that the distribution of dicentric cells followed a Poisson distribution and the dose-response curve was established using the estimated model, Ydic = 0.0003 (+/-0.0003) +0.0336 (+/-0.0115) x D + 0.0236 (+/-0.0054) x D2. In this study, the reliability of the dose-response curve in estimating the absorbed dose was also validated for 2 and 4 Gy using OSL dosimeters. The data were fitted into the constructed curve. The result of the validation study showed that the obtained estimate for the absorbed exposure doses was close to the true exposure doses.",Included

To identify complications associated with tumor-related lipid exudation (TRLE) after plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma. Methods. Comparative study including 294 patients with posterior uveal melanoma who developed TRLE after plaque radiotherapy (TRLE group) and 294 patients who did not develop TRLE (non-TRLE group). Patients in the TRLE group were matched with patients in the non-TRLE group for age, gender, and initial tumor thickness. results. The TRLE group was associated with significantly higher incidence of postradiation complications including early transient increase of serous retinal detachment (p<0.001), iris neovascularization (NVI) (p<0.001), neovascular glaucoma (NVG) (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p<0.001), vitreous hemorrhage (p<0.001), subretinal hemorrhage (p<0.001), and retinoschisis (p<0.001). A significant relationship was found between extent of TRLE and NVI (p<0.001), NVG (p<0.001), posterior synechia (p = 0.007), and retinoschisis over tumor (p = 0.010). Radiation-induced retinopathy, maculopathy, and papillopathy were not associated with presence or extent of TRLE. Tumor-related lipid exudation was also associated with worse final visual acuity (p = 0.011), higher rate of secondary enucleation (p<0.001), and lower rate of systemic metastasis (p = 0.006). Conclusions. Tumor-related lipid exudation following plaque radiotherapy of posterior uveal melanoma is associated with major intraocular complications and portends poor prognosis for final visual acuity and eye retention. These findings provide evidence for the presence of 2 distinct pathogenic mechanisms, one radiation-induced and one tumor-related, in development of postradiation complications in eyes with posterior uveal melanoma. © 2013 Wichtig Editore.",Excluded

Method(s): This single-center, retrospective, observational study examined the use of chest CT or MR for ED patients with MR angiography (MRA) negative for PE during April 2008 to March 2013. We compared the 1-year scan utilization for these cases to an age- and sex-matched cohort of patients who underwent CT angiography (CTA). We also calculated time to first follow-up scan and mean radiation dose in each arm. Trained data abstractors used a standardized protocol and electronic case report form to gather all outcomes of interest. Results are reported as means or proportions with their associated confidence intervals (CIs). Result(s): In all, 717 ED patients (430 MRAs and 287 CTAs) were included. At 1 year, the proportion undergoing subsequent imaging (MRA 16.7%, CTA 15.3%; difference = 1.4%, 95% CI 4.05%-6.86%) and time to first follow-up scan (difference = 13 days, 95% CI -22.69-48.7) did not differ between arms. Mean radiation dose per patient at 1 year was significantly higher in the CTA arm (9.82 mSv; 95% CI 9.12-10.53) compared with 2.92 mSv (95% CI 1.86-3.98) with MRA. Those with an index MRA were more likely to undergo subsequent MRAs (odds ratio 3.68; 95% CI 1.22-11.12) than those with an index CTA. However, in both arms, the majority (85%) of subsequent scans were CTAs.

924,"UV dose determines key characteristics of nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers worldwide. Although many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NMSC, UV radiation is an important risk factor. A fundamental question in skin cancer research is whether varying doses of total UV radiation influence key characteristics of NMSC. The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were, respectively, 57% and 29% (overall) (median, 28.6 months), 81% and 56% (cancer-specific), and 68% and 50% (local disease-free). Acute toxicity included pneumothorax (1.5%) and mucosal inflammation (10%). Late complications were hemoptysis (6.6% with 5% of fatalities), bronchitis (19.5%), and necrosis (3.5%). In multivariate analysis, a distal tumor location and the use of two catheters were associated with improved local disease-free survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively) and a distal tumor location with improved overall survival (p = 0.0001).

2805,"Characterization of biological peculiarities of the radioprotective activity of double-stranded RNA isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae The purpose of the article: Protection from ionizing radiation is the most important component in the curing malignant neoplasms, servicing atomic reactors, and resolving the situations associated with uncontrolled radioactive pollutions. In this regard, discovering new effective radioprotectors as well as novel principles of protecting living organisms from high-dose radiation is the most important factor, determining the new approaches in medical and technical usage of radiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Experimental animals were irradiated on the gamma-emitter (Cs137) with a dose of 9.4 Gy. Radioprotective properties of several agents (total RNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA and B-190) were estimated by the survival/death rates of experimental animals within 30-90 d. Pathomorphological examination of internal organs end electron microscope assay was done on days 9-12 after irradiation. Cloning and other molecular procedures were performed accordingly to commonly accepted protocols. For assessment of the internalization of labeled nucleic acid, bone marrow cells were incubated with double-stranded RNA labeled with 6-FAM fluorescent dye. Cells with internalized double-stranded RNA were assayed using Axio Imager M1 microscope. In the other experiment, bone marrow cells after incubation with double-stranded RNA were stained with Cy5-labeled anti-CD34 antibodies and assayed using Axioskop 2 microscope. Result(s): In this study, several biological features of the radioprotective action of double-stranded RNA are characterized. It was shown that 160 microg of the double-stranded RNA per mouse protect experimental animals from the absolutely lethal dose of gamma-radiation of 9.4 Gy. In different experiments, 80-100% of irradiated animals survive and live until their natural death. Radioprotective properties of double-stranded RNA were found to be independent on its sequence, but strictly dependent on its double-stranded form. Moreover, double-stranded RNA must have 'open' ends of the molecule to exert its radioprotective activity. Conclusion(s): Experiments indicate that radioprotective effect of double-stranded RNA is tightly bound to its internalization into hematopoietic stem cells, which further repopulate the spleen parenchyma of irradiated mice. Actively proliferating progenitors form the splenic colonies, which further serve as the basis for restoration of hematopoiesis and immune function and determine the survival of animals received the lethal dose of radiation.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
2658,"Evaluation of organ-at-risk dose reduction with jaw tracking technique in flattening filter-free beams in lung stereotactic body radiation therapy PURPOSE: (i) to investigate the capability of organ-at-risk (OAR) dose reduction with the jaw tracking (JT) technique in flattening filter-free (FFF) beams in lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), (ii) to propose a novel metric to quantify the jaw movements during JT, and (iii) to examine the relationships between the quantified jaw movements and reduction rate of OAR doses., METHODS: The individual SBRT plans with volumetric modulated arc therapy using the JT technique (JT-VMAT) and VMAT plans with a fixed jaw (FJ-VMAT) were created for 15 patients, and dosimetric parameters were compared. A jaw tracking complexity score (JTCS) was defined and compared with the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) modulation complexity score (MCS). The correlations between the JTCS and reduction rate of OAR doses were examined., RESULTS: The decrease of OARs doses was statistically significant in the JT-VMAT plans (1.2% in V20 of the lung and <1% in all other OARs). The correlations between the JTCS and MCS were not significant. There were significant correlations between the JTCS and the reduction rates in V20, V2.5, and Dmean of the lung, D1% of the spinal cord, and D90% of the body., CONCLUSIONS: A significant decrease of dosimetric parameters of OARs was found with JT-VMAT in FFF beams. This reduction is very small and probably not clinically relevant. JTCS, a novel metric to quantify the jaw movements during JT, was proposed, and the complexity of jaw movements did not correlate with that of the movements of MLC leaves. There were significant correlations between the JTCS and some dosimetric parameters of OARs. Copyright © 2019 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

2469,"Modifications of the cutaneous microrelief in the superficial radiation-induced fibrosis: Qualitative study Cutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by a skin retraction or atrophy, toughness to the palpation and often entails functional limitation. Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT). The present study suggests that the variations of the microrelief parameters could reflect the RIF evolution. This technique requires a validation in a larger series of patients, including patients with telangiectasia.",Excluded
2793,"Pulmonary lymphoma identified as a result of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer PURPOSE: To describe the frequency and findings of pulmonary lymphoma in asymptomatic people undergoing computed tomographic (CT) screening for lung cancer., METHODS: All lymphoma diagnoses resulting from CT screening of 31 567 at-risk subjects (median age, 61 years) were identified, and the CT images were reviewed to document the lesions as to number, location, density, shape, and margin. The presence of lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion was also documented., RESULTS: Five patients with pulmonary lymphoma were identified. The lymphoma was a B-cell lymphoma in three, Hodgkin's lymphoma in one, and malignant lymphoma in one; it was primary in four and secondary in one. One patient had two lesions; the other four patients each had one lesion. Four of the six lesions were a mass, and two were a nodule. Four of the lesions had irregular margins. Air bronchograms were seen in three. Growth assessment was useful in leading to decisions for biopsy., CONCLUSION: In a context of CT screening to detect lung cancer in asymptomatic volunteers, the diagnosis of pulmonary lymphoma was rare but, nevertheless, occurred in five (.016%) of 31 567 volunteers.",Excluded
1710,"Toxicity after volumetric modulated arc therapy for lung cancer: A monocentric retrospective study Background: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) is now widely implemented and has replaced classical three-dimensional (3D)-RT in many tumor sites, as it allows a better target dose conformity and a better sparing of organs a risk (OAR), at the expense, however, of increasing the volume of low dose to normal tissues. Clinical data on toxicities using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in lung cancer remain scarce. We aimed to report both acute (APT) and late (LPT) pulmonary and acute (AET) and late (LET) oesophageal toxicities in such setting. Method(s): All patients treated for a primary lung cancer with VMAT chemotherapy (ChT) in our center from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively included. Usual clinical, treatment and dosimetric features were collected. Univariate analysis was performed using the receiver operative characteristics approach while multivariate analysis (MVA) relied on logistic regression, calculated with Medcalc 14.8.1. Result(s): In total, 167 patients were included, with a median age of 66 years (39-88 years). Median radiation dose was 66 Gy (30-66 Gy); 82% patients received concomitant (32.3%), induction (25.7%) or induction followed by concomitant ChT (24%). After a median follow-up of 14.0 months, the G >=2 APT, AET, LPT and LET rates were 22.2%, 30.0%, 16.8% and 5.4%, respectively with low grade >=3 toxicity rates (respectively, 3%, 6.6%, 3% and 0%). On MVA, APT was significantly associated with V30 to the homolateral lung, AET with age, LPT with MEVS while no feature remained significantly correlated with LET. Conclusion(s): Low rates of pulmonary and esophageal toxicity were observed in our cohort. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.Copyright © 2021 Translational Lung Cancer Research.",Excluded
2448,"Procedural success, safety and patients satisfaction after second ablation of atrial fibrillation in the elderly: results from the German Ablation Registry Background: Aged patients are underrepresented in clinical trials on catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). In addition, results of outcomes after repeat ablation in the elderly are lacking. We report the results of first repeat AF ablation procedures of aged patients from a real-world multicenter prospective registry. Method(s): Patients undergoing second AF ablation included in the prospective, multicenter German Ablation Registry were divided in two groups (age > 70 years (group 1) and age <= 70 years (group 2)) and analyzed for procedural characteristics and clinical follow-up. Result(s): 738 patients were analyzed (108 patients in group 1, 630 patients in group 2). Significantly more aged patients had structural heart disease (56 patients (51.9%) vs. 203 patients (32.2%), p < 0.001). The majority of the patients underwent repeat pulmonary vein isolation (101 patients (93.5%) vs. 593 patients (94.1%), p = 0.98). More aged patients underwent ablation of left atrial linear lesions (78.1% vs. 57.3% of all linear lesions, p = 0.027). There was no difference in the occurrence of peri-procedural complications (7 patients (6.5%) vs. 24 patients (3.8%), p = 0.30). Recurrence of atrial arrhythmias was documented in 45/105 (42.9%) and 252/603 (41.8%) patients with available follow-up in groups 1 and 2 after a median of 447 (400; 532) and 473 (411; 544) days (p = 0.84). A comparable amount of patients were asymptomatic or reported symptom improvement after repeat ablation in both groups (80% (80/100) in group 1 and 77% (446/576) in group 2; p = 0.57). Conclusion(s): Repeat ablation for AF in elderly patients can be performed with safety and efficacy comparable to younger patients.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
577,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

2892,"Utility of new bioabsorptive screws in cervical anterior fusion Background: The aim of this study is to report our use of new bioabsorbable screws in cervical anterior fusion. These screws need not be removed because they are completely absorbed by resolution in vivo. We describe our method and the new bioabsorbable screws. Method(s): We used PLLA screws until September 2004 and uncalcined uHA-PLLA screws thereafter. They are completely absorbed by resolution to water and carbon dioxide upon in vivo hydrolysis. The uHA-PLLA screws are x-ray impenetrable, and their uHA content renders them osteoconductive. In cervical anterior fusion, the graft is inserted in the area of deletion resulting from decompression. The screws are inserted in the 4 corners of the vertebral body and graft. In long fusion, they are introduced in the 2 lateral wings of the bone graft on each vertebral body and in the 4 corners. Our method eliminates the need for plates or mesh. Result(s): We have used this method in 62 patients and encountered no complications. There were no screw or graft extrusions and no surgery-related infections. The patients were able to walk a few hours after the operation and wore a simple neck collar for a few days. Conclusion(s): This safe and easy method shortens the hospital stay and reduces the risk of graft extrusion and complications associated with the use of nonabsorbable devices. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

648,"The effect of oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and high-dose proton pump inhibitors on the histology of Barrett's esophagus Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Bile composition can be influenced by oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We prospectively investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) supplemented with UDCA in vivo in patients with BE. Patients with no or low-grade dysplasia who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI were eligible for the study. In order to exclude the effects of acid reflux, all patients were initially treated with 40 mg esomeprazole (ESO) twice daily for 6 months and continued on this dose till the end of the study (t = 12 months). During a period of 6 months (t = 6 month - t = 12 month) patients were treated with oral UDCA (600 mg twice daily). Patients underwent endoscopy at t = 0 months, t = 6 months and t = 12 months with multiple biopsies of the distal and proximal BE segment, normal squamous and gastric cardia. In addition, pH was measured at t = 0 months and t = 6 months using a BRAVO wireless pH capsule. Bile was sampled at the beginning of the UDCA treatment and 6 months later (t = 6 month and t = 12 month). All biopsies were reviewed for the extent of metaplasia, dysplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation. In addition, proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (villin, cytokeratins 7 and 20) and inflammation (COX-2) were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nine patients (mean age 60 years, median BE length 7 cm) were included, of whom six had no dysplasia and three had low-grade dysplasia. pH measurements revealed a normal acid exposure in most patients at t = 0 and t = 6 months. In addition, bile composition analysis demonstrated the efficacy of UDCA. Combining the results of both phases of the study, no significant changes were seen in any of the histological or IHC parameters. Differentiation and proliferation parameters showed no significant changes. In this study, in BE patients who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI, increasing the PPI dose to the maximum for 6 months followed by the addition of UDCA for 6 months did not result in significant histological or IHC changes in their BE.",Excluded
1500,"Evaluating the role of prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer Purpose: To determine the effect of prophylactic gastrostomy tube (GT) placement on acute and long-term outcome for patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Methods and Materials: One hundred twenty consecutive patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy for Stage III/IV head and neck cancer to a median dose of 70 Gy (range, 64-74 Gy). The most common primary site was the oropharynx (66 patients). Sixty-seven patients (56%) were treated using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Seventy patients (58%) received prophylactic GT placement at the discretion of the physician before initiation of chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): Prophylactic GT placement significantly reduced weight loss during radiation therapy from 43 pounds (range, 0 to 76 pounds) to 19 pounds (range, 0 to 51 pounds), which corresponded to a net change of -14% (range, 0% to -30%) and -8% (range, +1% to -22%) from baseline, respectively (p < 0.001). However, the proportion of patients who were GT-dependent at 6- and 12-months after treatment was 41% and 21%, respectively, compared with 8% and 0%, respectively, for those with and without prophylactic GT (p < 0.001). Additionally, prophylactic GT was associated with a significantly higher incidence of late esophageal stricture compared with those who did not have prophylactic GT (30% vs. 6%, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Although prophylactic GT placement was effective at preventing acute weight loss and the need for intravenous hydration, it was also associated with significantly higher rates of late esophageal toxicity. The benefits of this strategy must be balanced with the risks. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
399,"Neuromuscular activation patterns during treadmill walking after space flight Astronauts adopt a variety of neuromuscular control strategies during space flight that are appropriate for locomoting in that unique environment, but are less than optimal upon return to Earth. We report here the first systematic investigation of potential adaptations in neuromuscular activity patterns associated with postflight locomotion. Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded
2415,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded
1158,"Diagnostic and prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score of zero: Is it time for guidelines to change? Introduction: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) use has progressively increased as the preferred initial test to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) when clinical likelihood is low. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected by CT is a well-established marker for cardiovascular risk. However, it is not recommended for diagnosis of obstructive CAD. Absence of CAC, defined as an Agatston score of zero, has been associated to good prognosis despite underestimation of non-calcified plaques. Purpose(s): To evaluate whether zero CAC score could help ruling out obstructive CAD in a safely manner. Method(s): Observational study based on a prospective database of patients (pts) referred to cardiac CT between 2017 and 2019. Pts with an Agatston score of zero were selected. Result(s): We included 176 pts with zero CAC score and non-invasive coronary angiography performed. The median duration of follow-up was 23.9 months. Baseline characteristics of the population are shown in Table 1. In 117 pts (66.5%), cardiac CT was indicated as part of their chest pain evaluation. Mean age was 57.2 years old, 68.2% were women and only and 9.4% were active smokers. Normal coronary arteries were found in 173 pts (98.3%). Obstructive CAD, defined as >=50% luminal diameter stenosis of a major vessel, was present in 1/176 (0.6%); while non-obstructive atherosclerotic plaques were found in 2 pts (1.1%). During follow-up, one patient died of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. None either suffered from myocardial infarction or needed coronary revascularization. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, a zero CAC score detected by cardiac CT rules out obstructive coronary artery disease in 98.3%, with only 1.7% of non-calcified atherosclerosis plaques and 0.6% of major adverse events. Although further research on this topic is needed, these results support the fact that non-invasive coronary angiography could be avoided in patients with low clinical likelihood of CAD and zero CAC score, facilitating the management of the increasing demand for coronary CT and reduction of radiation dose.",Excluded

Aim To test the association of UV exposure with the rates and severity of IBD hospitalisation. Methods We conducted a retrospective nationwide analysis of 649 932 Crohn's disease (CD), 384 267 ulcerative colitis (UC), and 288 894 297 non-IBD hospitalisations in the US between 1998 and 2010. Mean UV exposure was assigned to each hospitalisation using surface measures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Relative rates across UV exposures were estimated for IBD hospitalisations, prolonged hospitalisations, bowel surgeries and deaths. Results Among IBD patients, lower UV exposures had increased hospitalisation rates for CD (217.8 vs. 182.5 per 100 000 overall hospitalisations with low and very high UV, respectively; P trend <0.001) and UC (123.2 vs. 113.8 per 100 000; P trend = 0.033). Low UV groups had greater relative rates of prolonged hospitalisations [CD: 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30], bowel surgeries (CD: 1.24, 95% CI 1.16-1.32; UC: 1.21, 95% CI 1.09-1.33), and CD deaths (CD: 1.76, 95% CI 1.14-2.71; UC: 1.24, 95% CI 0.92-1.67). Among non-IBD patients, low UV was associated with prolonged hospitalisations (1.09; 95% CI 1.07-1.11) and deaths (1.13; 95% CI 1.09-1.17), but not bowel surgeries (1.01; 95% CI 0.99-1.03). Conclusions Lower ultraviolet exposure is associated with greater rates of hospitalisation, prolonged hospitalisation and the need for bowel surgery in IBD. This trend for bowel surgery was not seen with non-IBD encounters. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
1803,"Determination of physical parameters associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic low back pain BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy that is associated with various pain-related disabilities such as chronic low back pain (LBP), should be questioned besides physical assessments. OBJECTIVE(S): To investigate the physical factors associated with self-efficacy in patients with chronic mechanic LBP. METHOD(S): One hundred nine patients diagnosed as chronic mechanic LBP (65 females, 44 males) between 20-50 years old were included to this study. The intensity of LBP was assessed by using a 10-cm Visual Analogue Scale. For musculoskeletal fitness measurement; muscle strength, muscle endurance, and flexibility tests were applied. Functional Reach Test for balance evaluation, Self-Efficacy Scale for self-efficacy measurement, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire for disability level evaluation were used. RESULT(S): We found a moderate negative correlation between self-efficacy and pain intensity (r=-0.506); a negative and strong correlation between self-efficacy and disability level (r=-0.654) (p< 0.05). Self efficacy had a significant association with right (r= 0.265) and left (r= 0.290) lateral side bending flexibility (p< 0.05). According to multiple regression analysis results, it was found that disability level had a significant effect on self-efficacy (beta=-2.014; p< 0.01). CONCLUSION(S): Poor musculoskeletal fitness and pain intensity may cause decreasing self-efficacy but the major determinant of decreased self-efficacy was low-back related disability scores.Copyright © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

2886,"Preoperative oxaliplatin, capecitabine, and external beam radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed, primary operable, cT3NxMo, low rectal cancer: A phase II study Purpose: In patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), preoperative chemoradiation is known to improve local control, and down-staging of the tumor serves as a surrogate for survival. Intensification of the systemic therapy may lead to higher down- staging rates and, thus, enhance survival. This phase II study investigated the efficacy and safety of preoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Patients with LARC of the mid and lower rectum, T3NxM0 staged by MRI received radiotherapy (total dose 45 Gy) in combination with oral capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice a day on radiotherapy days; weeks 1-4) and oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously (days 1, 8, 15, and 22). Efficacy was evaluated as rate of tumor down-categorization at the T level. Result(s): A total of 59 patients were enrolled (19 women, 40 men; median age of 61 years) and all were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Down-categorization at the T level was observed in 53% with pathological complete response in 6 patients (10%). Actual total radiotherapy, oxaliplatin and capecitabine doses received were 97%, 90%, and 93% of the protocol-specified preplanned doses, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicity was observed in 15 patients (25%). The most frequent was diarrhea (12%). Conclusion(s): Preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine and oxaliplatin is feasible in patients with MRI-proven cT3 LARC. The only clinically relevant toxicity was diarrhea. Overall, efficacy of the multimodality treatment was good, but not markedly exceeding that of 5-FU- or capecitabine-based chemoradiation approaches. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded

Method(s): We evaluated 123 United States Radiologic Technologists subjects who wore personal UVR dosimeters for 8 hours daily for up to 7 days (N = 837 days). Potential predictors of personal UVR derived from a self-administered questionnaire, and public databases that provided daily estimates of ambient UVR and weather conditions. Factors potentially related to personal UVR exposure were tested individually and in a model including all significant variables. Result(s): The strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure in the full model were ambient UVR, latitude, daily rainfall, and skin reaction to prolonged sunlight (R2 = 0.30). In a model containing only environmental and meteorological variables, ambient UVR, latitude, and daily rainfall were the strongest predictors of daily personal UVR exposure (R2 = 0.25). Conclusion(s): In the absence of feasible measures of individual longitudinal sun exposure history, stable personal characteristics, ambient UVR, and weather parameters may help estimate long-term personal UVR exposure.",Excluded
618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones. These results suggest probable involvement of I-J-bearing suppressor T-cells in the hematopoietic disorders induced by pertussis vaccine.,Excluded

The ULD-CT examinations were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Afterwards, consensus reading of the ULD-CT and R-CT examinations was done. Individual nodules were classified benign (benign calcifications) and non-benign. The studies were classified in 4 subgroups: 1) non-benign nodule evident; 2) non-benign nodule probable; 3) non-benign nodule possible, but not likely; 4) no-non benign nodule., RESULTS: ULD-CT detected 180 nodules in 47 patients, while R-CT showed 168 nodules in 39 patients. The sensitivity of ULD-CT was 87 % in detecting nodules regardless of size and 94 % in detecting nodules > or = 5 mm. Regarding the prediction of a case with non-benign nodules (subgroups 1 to 3), the sensitivity of ULD-CT was 94 % and the specificity 75 %., CONCLUSION: ULD-CT is a good diagnostic tool in detecting lung nodules > or = 5 mm. Radiation dose can be markedly reduced. A negative ULD-CT study excludes non-benign nodules in R-CT with a high probability. In case of a positive ULD-CT, R-CT can be immediately followed.",Excluded
3363,"Acceptable levels for ingestion of dimethylsilanediol in water on the International Space Station INTRODUCTION: Water is recovered aboard the International Space Station (ISS) from humidity condensate and treated urine. The product water is monitored for total organic carbon (TOC). In 2010 the TOC readings indicated that a new contaminant had entered the potable water and was steadily increasing toward the TOC screening limit of 3 mg x L(-1). In a ground-based laboratory, chemists discovered that dimethylsilanediol (DMSD) was the principal new contaminant. As no standard existed for safe levels of DMSD in water, the Toxicology Office at Johnson Space Center was asked to set such a standard., METHODS: The Toxicology Office used methods developed over the past decade, in collaboration with the National Research Council Committee on Toxicology, for setting Spacecraft Water Exposure Guidelines (SWEGs). These methods require a thorough literature search and development of an acceptable concentration (AC) for each potential toxic effect, keeping in mind that the adverse effects that accompany spaceflight could increase toxicity for certain end points. Benchmark dose modeling was encouraged if sufficient data were available. The most sensitive AC becomes the driver for the SWEG., RESULTS: Hematotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and possibly neurotoxicity were the most sensitive toxicological endpoints for DMSD., CONCLUSIONS: The SWEG for DMSD for 100 d of ingestion was set at 35 mg x L(-1), which is equivalent to 9 mg x L(-1) as TOC. This is well above the TOC SWEG of 3 mg x L(-1) and the peak DMSD level of processed water observed on orbit, which was 2.2 mg x L(-1) asTOC (8.5 mg x L(-10 of DMSD).",Excluded
342,"Malignant melanoma risk by nativity, place of residence at diagnosis, and age at migration Although geographic latitude is clearly linked to the risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, the chronology of this link is unclear. Based on the 4,611 cases of melanoma with known place of nativity diagnosed in 1972-82 among the non-Latino White residents of Los Angeles County (California, United States) of known place of origin, migrants to Los Angeles from higher US latitudes enjoy relative safety from skin melanoma. This relative safety is largely unaffected by the interval since migration, even after decades of residence in Los Angeles. The same relative protection is enjoyed by native residents of more northerly US communities in comparison with co-resident migrants from the southwestern US. While the observed effect of latitude is consistent with the accepted importance of solar radiation as a determinant of melanoma risk, it suggests that early, rather than late or cumulative, exposure is of most importance. This finding does not affirm the belief that protection of adult skin from exposure to the sun will reduce the risk from melanoma. It does suggest that decades must pass before it will be possible to assess the impact on melanoma risk of any increase in ultraviolet radiation delivered to the earth as a result of the destruction of atmospheric ozone.",Excluded
2211,"Increased incidence of haematological cancer among physicians in a University Hospital OBJECTIVES: The oral report of eight cases of cancer over a period of 3 years among physicians working in a French University Hospital led us to conduct a retrospective cohort study to compare the incidence of cancer in these physicians with that of the general population living in the same area., METHOD: The cohort consisted of 940 physicians (72% male, 28% female) who had worked for at least 1 year in this hospital between 1945 and 1994 (a total of 10,693 person-years). The incidence of cancer among physicians was compared with that of the general population using a local cancer registry which has recorded all cancer cases occurring in the Department between 1979 and 1994. Standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for all causes of cancer and site by site., RESULTS: Although the global incidence of cancer did not differ from that of the general population (SIR=0.97; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-1.5), a significantly increased incidence of haematological malignancy was found among physicians (SIR=5.45; 95% CI 2-11.9)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings pointed out the risk of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer among physicians who started working after 1945 when the first rules pertaining to protection from ionising radiation came into effect. However, limitations of this study such as limited statistical power and lack of individual exposure data should be considered in the interpretation of these findings. Possible aetiological factors responsible for these risks are discussed. Education about general safety protection programmes against carcinogenic risk factors including physical, biological and chemical agents still remains a priority among physicians.",Excluded
1653,"CT-Urography In this paper we present an overview of CT-Urography. With the advent of multislice CT scanners and the evolution of image processing methods this technique now affords optimal urographic images comparable to those obtained with conventional techniques. We describe the acquisition techniques and protocols used by the various authors. Effective radiation dose has conditioned the use of CT-Urography so that the tendency today is to reduce the number of scans by performing, after the nonenhanced scan, a single contrast-enhanced scan comprising both the nephrographic and urographic phase. With the use of multislice CT the quality of the urogram improves with the number of slices. We illustrate a variety of processing techniques, multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), maximum (MIP) and average intensity projection (AIP) and volume rendering (VR) and present a series of upper urinary tract tumours testifying to the superiority of the AIP technique over MIP. We then review the results of comparative studies of CT-Urography with conventional urography in upper urinary tract diagnostics. Finally, we describe the advantages and limitations of CT-Urography.",Excluded
237,"Disaster preparedness education and a Midwest Regional Poison Center OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge and comfort related to disaster preparedness and response gained and retained from a disaster medicine workshop given to Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI). DESIGN: A pilot study with a pre-post intervention design. SETTING: A Midwest Regional Poison Center. PARTICIPANTS: All CSPIs employed at the participating Poison Center (N = 27) were recruited. Participation ranged from 44 percent (n = 12) for the 4-month postworkshop knowledge quiz to 78 percent (n = 21) for the preworkshop survey. INTERVENTION: A disaster medicine workshop was given to the CSPIs. Quizzes and surveys were done preworkshop and then repeated at 1 week, 4 months, and 14 months postworkshop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSPI knowledge and comfort pertaining to disaster-related calls. RESULT(S): CSPIs' comfort levels with calls regarding major chemical or nuclear/radiation disasters significantly increased and stayed elevated during all follow-up periods [Kruskal-Wallis chi2 (3) = 13.1, p = 0.01]. The average preworkshop quiz score was 58.2 percent. A statistically significant increase in mean quiz score was demonstrated amongst preworkshop and postworkshop scores at all tested time intervals (F = 18.8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): CSPIs' knowledge regarding disaster management significantly increased after a disaster medicine workshop, and this knowledge was significantly retained for the 14-month duration of this study. Currently, there are no uniform guidelines for Poison Centers regarding disaster response training. Studies targeted at the development of educational competencies for CSPIs and disaster response would help to standardize this much needed education.",Excluded

Nine patients who did not agree with radiation therapy, and therefore underwent rotational atherectomy and balloon angioplasty for diffuse in-stent restenosis in the same study period, were selected for control groups. Serial IVUS comparisons were available in 44 of 50 patients with radiation therapy and 7 of 9 control patients. At 6-month follow-up, there was less significant increase of IH area in patients with radiation therapy than in control patients (Delta IH area = 0.1 +/- 0.8 mm(2) vs. 2.6 +/- 1.8 mm(2), P > 0.001 in mean values, and 0.6 +/- 1.4 mm(2) vs. 2.9 +/- 2.1 mm(2), P = 0.026 in values of follow-up lesion site, respectively).

721,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are sex specific Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads. These data constitute the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced bystander effects in mouse spleen in vivo. We show the role of sex hormones in spleen bystander responses and discuss implications of the observed changes.",Included

The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were <4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses <26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia., CONCLUSION: The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years.",Excluded
3462,"Pattern of care and outcome in elderly patients with glioblastoma: Data in 151 patients from 3 Lombardia Hospitals The appropriate treatment approach for elderly patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is unclear, although different studies suggest survival benefit in fit patients treated with radiotherapy and chemiotherapy after surgery. We performed a retrospective analysis of 151 patients older than 65 years with GBM treated in 3 Lombardia Hospitals. In univariate regression analysis higher KPS (p = 0.02), macroscopical total resection (p < 0.003), radiotherapy (p < 0.0001), chemotherapy (p < 0.0001) and second line chemotheraphy (p = 0.02) were of positive prognostic value. On the contrary older age (> 70 years), presence of seizure at onset and additional resection after tumor recurrence did not influence OS. Multivariate analysis revealed radiotherapy (HR 0.2 p < 0.0001) and extent of surgery (HR 0.3, p = 0,0063) as positive independent prognostic factors. Patients receiving radio-chemiotherapy displayed more treatment-related toxicities with a slightly prolonged OS versus those receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy. With the limits of a retrospective study, our data suggest that in elderly fit patients extensive surgery should be considered, moreover adjuvant treatments led to an increase in OS. Randomized controlled study are needed to develop treatment guidelines for elderly GBM patients and to assess whether the combination of post-surgical radio and chemiotherapy may be superior to hypofractionated radiotherapy and chemiotherapy in fit patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
939,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded

277,"Intestinal and colonic motor alterations associated with irradiation-induced diarrhoea in rats Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included
57,"Failure patterns relative to radiation treatment fields for stage II-IV thymoma INTRODUCTION: The optimal radiation therapy (RT) field design for thymomas remains unclear. Here we report the failure patterns in stage II-IV thymoma after RT at two tertiary referral centers, classified according to the new International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group definitions. METHOD(S): We reviewed 156 stage II-IV patients with thymoma treated with definitive (n=24) or adjuvant (n=132) RT. All RT was delivered without elective nodal irradiation (median dose 5040 cGy). Intrathoracic failures were classified as (1) in-field failures (within 100% isodose line [IDL]), (2) marginal recurrences (<100% and >=50% IDL), and (3) out-of-field failures (outside the 50% IDL). RESULT(S): The median follow-up was 61 months. Surgical margins were positive in 39%. The median tumor size was 9 cm. The 5-year cumulative incidence of all intrathoracic failures was 24% (n=34). Failures occurred within the RT field (n=5), marginally (n=1), out-of-field (n=22), and synchronously in- and out-of-field (n=6). The 5-year cumulative incidence of in-field failures was 7%. These were associated with Masaoka stage and tumor size. Macroscopically positive margins were associated with more local failures. Intrathoracic failures occurred most commonly in the pleural space (n=29) and lymph nodes (n=9). Patients with more advanced stage, and those treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy had more intrathoracic failures. RT dose and chemotherapy did not impact failure patterns. CONCLUSION(S): Although there were few in-field failures in patients who received RT for stage II-IV thymomas, a high rate of out-of-field intrathoracic failures still occurred. Further study is necessary to identify treatment approaches that prevent pleural recurrences. Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded
1851,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective? BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included
2821,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures. However, a definite conclusion can only be drawn on replication by different studies among individuals who are highly exposed to IR.",Included

504,"Regulation of the metastasis of murine ocular melanoma by natural killer cells In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed.

726,"Photochemical repair of Achilles tendon rupture in a rat model Background. Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is an emerging technique for bonding or sealing tissue surfaces that requires light and a photoactive dye for its effect. The potential of PTB for tendon repair was assessed in a rat model. Materials and methods. The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration as a function of wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0.68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0.04) but not 14 days (p = 0.75) post-repair. Conclusions. PTB provides a benefit to tendon repair at early stages in repair and is worthy of further investigation as a potential surgical adjunct for tendon repair in orthopedic surgeries. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

For workers in the highest category (mean, 60 mGy) versus lowest category (mean, 5 mGy) of occupational dose to the lens of the eye, the adjusted hazard ratio of cataract was 1.18 (95% confidence interval: 0.99, 1.40). Findings challenge the National Council on Radiation Protection and International Commission on Radiological Protection assumptions that the lowest cumulative ionizing radiation dose to the lens of the eye that can produce a progressive cataract is approximately 2 Gy, and they support the hypothesis that the lowest cataractogenic dose in humans is substantially less than previously thought.",Included
1617,"Probability of mediastinal involvement in non-small-cell lung cancer: A statistical definition of the clinical target volume for 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy? Purpose: Conformal irradiation (3D-CRT) of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is largely based on precise definition of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn). A reduction of the number of nodal stations to be irradiated would facilitate tumor dose escalation. The aim of this study was to design a mathematical tool based on documented data to predict the risk of metastatic involvement for each nodal station. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the large surgical series published in the literature to identify the main pretreatment parameters that modify the risk of nodal invasion. The probability of involvement for the 17 nodal stations described by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) was computed from all these publications. Starting with the primary site of the tumor as the main characteristic, we built a probabilistic tree for each nodal station representing the risk distribution as a function of each tumor feature. Statistical analysis used the inversion of probability trees method described by Weinstein and Feinberg. Validation of the software based on 134 patients from two different populations was performed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): Analysis of all of the various parameters of pretreatment staging relative to each level of the ATS map results in 20,000 different combinations. The first parameters included in the tree, depending on tumor site, were histologic classification, metastatic stage, nodal stage weighted as a function of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic examination used (positron emission tomography scan, computed tomography scan), and tumor stage. Software is proposed to compute a predicted probability of involvement of each nodal station for any given clinical presentation. Double cross validation confirmed the methodology. A 10% cutoff point was calculated from ROC and logistic model giving the best prediction of mediastinal lymph node involvement. Conclusion(s): To more accurately define the CTVn in NSCLC three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, we propose a software that evaluates the risk of mediastinal lymph node involvement from easily accessible individual pretreatment parameters. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3135,"Comparison of low-dose and standard-dose helical CT in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of low-dose helical computed tomography by comparing the number of nodules detected at low- and standard-dose CT. The prospective study included 25 patients who were referred to CT scan for the assessment of pulmonary metastases. All patients underwent CT examinations at both standard- (200 mA, 120 kV, collimation 5 mm, table feed 10 mm per rotation) and low-dose (50 mA, 120 kV, collimation 5 mm, table feed 10 mm per rotation). The number of nodules detected at each protocol was recorded. The size of the nodules was measured electronically and categorized as <3, 3-4.9, 5-6.9, 7-9.9, and >/=10 mm. Finally, the nodules detected at only standard- or low-dose CT were assessed for the underlying causes of discrepancy. In 25 patients, 533 nodules were detected at standard-dose, whereas 518 nodules were observed at low-dose CT. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of nodules detected at standard- or low-dose CT ( p>0.05). Four hundred ninety-one (87.7%) nodules were detected at both standard- or low-dose CT, 42 (7.5%) nodules were observed only at standard-dose CT, and 27 (4.8%) nodules were seen only at low-dose CT. The sensitivity of low-dose CT was 92.5% for all nodules, 88.1% for nodules <5 mm, and 97.4% for nodules >/=5 mm. No significant image artifact interfering with nodule detection was observed at low-dose CT. The low-dose CT protocol used in this study provided images of adequate quality; thus, it can be used reliably in the detection or exclusion of pulmonary nodules.",Excluded
954,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for operable Stage i non-small-cell lung cancer: Can SBRT be comparable to surgery? Purpose: To review treatment outcomes for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in medically operable patients with Stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), using a Japanese multi-institutional database. Patients and Methods: Between 1995 and 2004, a total of 87 patients with Stage I NSCLC (median age, 74 years; T1N0M0, n = 65; T2N0M0, n = 22) who were medically operable but refused surgery were treated using SBRT alone in 14 institutions. Stereotactic three-dimensional treatment was performed using noncoplanar dynamic arcs or multiple static ports. Total dose was 45-72.5 Gy at the isocenter, administered in 3-10 fractions. Median calculated biological effective dose was 116 Gy (range, 100-141 Gy). Data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): During follow-up (median, 55 months), cumulative local control rates for T1 and T2 tumors at 5 years after SBRT were 92% and 73%, respectively. Pulmonary complications above Grade 2 arose in 1 patient (1.1%). Five-year overall survival rates for Stage IA and IB subgroups were 72% and 62%, respectively. One patient who developed local recurrences safely underwent salvage surgery. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe and promising as a radical treatment for operable Stage I NSCLC. The survival rate for SBRT is potentially comparable to that for surgery. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
780,"The pattern and time course of somatosensory changes in the human UVB sunburn model reveal the presence of peripheral and central sensitization The ultraviolet B (UVB) sunburn model was characterized with a comprehensive battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST). Primary hyperalgesia in UVB-irradiated skin and secondary hyperalgesia in adjacent nonirradiated skin were studied in 22 healthy subjects 24h after irradiation with UVB at 3-fold minimal erythema dose of a skin area 5 cm in diameter at the thigh and compared to mirror-image contralateral control areas. The time course of hyperalgesia over 96 h was studied in a subgroup of 12 subjects. Within the sunburn area, cold hyperesthesia (P=.01), profound generalized hyperalgesia to heat (P<.001), cold (P<.05), pinprick and pressure (P<.001), and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia (P<.001) were present. The finding of cold hyperalgesia and cold hyperesthesia is new in this model. The sunburn was surrounded by large areas of pinprick hyperalgesia (mean+/-SEM, 218+/-32 cm(2)) and a small rim of dynamic mechanical allodynia but no other sensory changes. Although of smaller magnitude, secondary hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia adjacent to the UVB-irradiated area were statistically highly significant. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia developed in parallel within hours, peaked after 24-32 h, and lasted for more than 96 h. These data reveal that the UVB sunburn model activates a broad spectrum of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms and hence is a useful human surrogate model to be used as a screening tool for target engagement in phases 1 and 2a of drug development.

1785,"Prognostic value of the micronucleus assay for clinical endpoints in neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer BACKGROUND: The question whether lymphocyte radiosensitivity is representative of patients' response to radiotherapy (RT) remains unsolved. We analyzed lymphocyte cytogenetic damage in patients who were homogeneously treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) for rectal cancer within clinical trials. We tested for interindividual variation and consistent radiosensitivity after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation, analyzed the effect of patients' and RCT characteristics on cytogenetic damage, and tested for correlations with patients' outcome in terms of tumor response, survival and treatment-related toxicity., METHODS: The cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMNcyt) assay was performed on the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLCs) of 134 patients obtained before, during, at the end of RCT, and during the 2-year follow-up. A subset of PBLCs obtained before RCT was irradiated in-vitro with 3 Gy. RCT included 50.4 Gy of pelvic RT with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone (n = 78) or 5-FU plus oxaliplatin (n = 56). The analyzed variables included patients' age, gender, RT characteristics (planning target volume size [PTV size], RT technique), and chemotherapy characteristics (5-FU plasma levels, addition of oxaliplatin). Outcome was analyzed as tumor regression, patient survival, and acute and late toxicity., RESULTS: Cytogenetic damage increased significantly with the radiation dose and varied substantially between individuals. Women were more sensitive than men; no significant age-dependent differences were observed. There was a significant correlation between the cytogenetic damage after in-vitro irradiation and in-vivo RCT. We found a significant effect of the PTV size on the yields of cytogenetic damage after RCT, while the RT technique had no effect. Neither the addition of oxaliplatin nor the 5-FU levels influenced cytogenetic damage. We found no correlation between patient outcome and the cytogenetic damage., CONCLUSIONS: We found consistent cytogenetic damage in lymphocytes after in-vivo RCT and in-vitro irradiation. Gender was confirmed as a well-known, and the PTV size was identified as a less well-known influencing variable on lymphocyte cytogenetic damage after partial-body irradiation. A consistent level of cytogenetic damage after in-vivo and in-vitro irradiation may indicate the importance of genetic factors for individual radiosensitivity. However, we found no evidence that in-vivo or in-vitro irradiation-induced cytogenetic damage is an adequate biomarker for the response to RCT in rectal cancer patients.",Excluded

1684,"Radiation-Induced Myocardial Fibrosis in Long-Term Esophageal Cancer Survivors Purpose: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity is a potential lethal complication. The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included
3257,"[Influence of the dose rate and postradiation hyperthermia on the cytogenetic effect of irradiation of cells in the G0 stage by 252Cf and 60Co sources] The paper is concerned with the results of a comparative study of radiation injury of chromosomes of human lymphocytes at the G0 stage resulting from the influence of 60Co gamma quanta and high activity 252Cf radiation sources and depending on a dose and dose rate; with the potentialities of modifying a cytogenetic effect of irradiation by postradiation hyperthermia of cells. It has been shown that at the G0 stage of a cell cycle the frequency of chromosome aberrations does not depend on the dose rate of 252Cf radiation within the range of 0.0035-0.35 Gy/min. by the neutron component. Linear correlation between the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations and a dose was observed within a dose range of 0.27-3.1 Gy. Thus, a conclusion is that postradiation hyperthermia at the G0 stage does not almost influence the frequency of chromosome aberrations during 252Cf radiation, and increases it insignificantly during 60Co gamma-radiation.",Included
2484,"Reactive oxygen species and DNA damage after ultrasound exposure The aim of this work was to detect the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals after ultrasound (US) exposure and test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species induced by ultrasound can contribute to DNA damage. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed in incubated medium after sonication with 1 MHz continuous ultrasound at the intensities of 0.61-2.44 W/cm2. Free radicals and hydrogen peroxide produced by ultrasound exposure of cells can lead to DNA damage. Comet assay was used to assess the effect of ultrasound on the level of nuclear DNA damage. The nucleated erythrocytes from fish were exposed in vitro to ultrasound at the same intensities and frequency. It was noticed that ultrasound in all used intensities induced DNA damage. The effect was not eliminated by the addition of catalase, which indicates that DNA damage was not caused by hydrogen peroxide only. The results showed that the DNA damage can be repair and this mechanism was the most effective after 30 and 60 min after sonication. Furthermore, the ultrasound-induced DNA damage in the presence of sonosensitizer (Zn- and AlCl-phthalocyanine) was studied. It was noticed that phthalocyaniens (Pcs) alone or with ultrasound did not induce significant changes in the level of DNA damage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively. Of 58 benign nodules, 27 showed less than 25 HU wash-in, 14 showed persistent contrast enhancement without washout and with wash-in of 25 HU or greater, and 11 showed washout greater than 31 HU and wash-in of 25 HU or greater.

1002,"The value of the initial post-EVAR computed tomography angiography scan in predicting future secondary procedures using the Powerlink stent graft Objective: Current long-term surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at scheduled, lifelong intervals. The cancer and nephrotoxicity risks of interval CT scanning and prolonged radiation exposure are concerning. We sought to determine if surveillance CT angiography (CTA) can be safely reduced. Method(s): From July 2000 to November 2007, 345 patients were enrolled in U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials of the Powerlink System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif). An independent core laboratory analyzed 1519 post-EVAR CT scans (N = 1519) to 5 years to evaluate aneurysm size, migration, presence of endoleak, and evidence of graft obstruction. Analyses were conducted to determine the value of the initial CTA scan in predicting future secondary procedures in enrolled patients. Result(s): At any time during follow-up, CTA identified endoleak in 123 patients (36%), with 95% of endoleaks being type II. In addition, 49 patients underwent 72 secondary procedures at a mean of 22 +/- 21 months (range, 2-2007 days) after initial EVAR. These were based on clinical identification of limb ischemia in 13 interventions (18%) or core laboratory identification of abnormal CT finding in 58 interventions (81%). Of the 58 core laboratory identified findings, the inciting abnormality was present on the initial postoperative scan in 49 (84%). Of the remaining nine CT-driven procedures, three (5.2%) were due to late sac expansion attributed to type II endoleak (n= 2) or endotension (n= 1); two (3.4%) were for prophylactic reasons in the absence of endoleak; and four (6.8%) were in patients with type II endoleak not observed by the core laboratory and without sac expansion. The negative predictive value of the initial postoperative CTA for the need for a secondary procedure is therefore 96.4%, which can be improved to 97.6% with duplex ultrasound surveillance to detect sac expansion. Thus, a negative initial postoperative CTA is highly predictive of long-term freedom from secondary intervention. Conclusion(s): Among enrolled patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR, most abnormalities that result in a secondary procedure are detected on the initial postoperative CTA or present with clinical symptoms. Long-term surveillance CTA may therefore be replaced by duplex ultrasound imaging if the initial postoperative CTA shows no abnormalities.

The effect on detection of fault states of varying the number of polygon vertices from 4 to 20 in a display presented peripherally around a dynamic, simulated flight display was studied. Presence of the dynamic task reduced both speed and accuracy of response to the polygon display but did not significantly affect the pattern of response to differing numbers of vertices. All measures of performance were better with larger numbers of vertices. If the vertices are processed serially, more vertices require more processing time. Therefore, the result argues for holistic processing and implies that such information integration is beneficial to human performance in fault detection.",Excluded
3357,"Reporting on acromion morphology: Classifications demonstrate significant correlation Objectives Various classifications of acromion morphology exist in the literature. Only a few studies have compared these classifications and their results vary substantially. The primary purpose of this study was to determine a correlation between different classifications of acromial morphology on a large cohort. The secondary purpose was to establish if there is a difference between age, sides and gender. Methods A retrospective analysis of 1853 subjects' shoulder CTs has been performed. A total of 350 CT scans of polytraumatised patients have been selected out of the initial cohort, after exclusion of fractures and technically insufficient scans. Acromial slope, type, lateral acromion angle (LAA) and acromion index were measured and gender, age and side differences were analysed. Correlations between the different classifications were analysed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Results The average patient age of this cohort was 48 (range 16-90). There were 232 men and 118 women. There was a significant correlation between all classifications. Excellent correlations have been shown for left-right comparison of all measurements. Gender showed no correlation to any of the measurements. Age was correlated to LAA and acromial type. Conclusion There is a significant correlation between all investigated acromion classifications, demonstrated with the CT. This may aid the clinician in choosing a classification to use when reporting on a patient, depending on the pathology even when plain X-rays are obtained. Age is correlated to LAA and acromial type. There is a strong bilateral correlation within each patient. Gender is not correlated to the acromial shape in any classification.

Our experience included eight male and three female patients. The median patient age at GKSR was 62 years (range 46-72 years). At the time of GKSR, seven patients had a first recurrence and four had two or more recurrences. The median interval from the initial diagnosis until GKSR was 17 months (range 5-34.5 months). The median tumor volume was 13.6 cm(3) (range 1.2-45.1 cm(3)) and the median margin dose of GKSR was 16 Gy (range 13-18 Gy). Following GKSR, bevacizumab was administrated with irinotecan in nine patients and with temozolomide in one patient. One patient was treated with bevacizumab monotherapy. The treatment outcomes were compared to 44 case-matched controls who underwent GKSR without additional bevacizumab. At a median of 13.7 months (range 4.6-28.3 months) after radiosurgery, tumor progression was evident in seven patients. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (95% confidential interval (CI), 6.5-23.3 months). Six-month and 1-year PFS rates were 73 and 55%, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) from GKSR was 18 months (95% CI, 10.1-25.7 months) and 1-year OS rate was 73%. One patient (9%) experienced grade III toxicity and one patient (9%) had major adverse radiation effects. Compared with patients who did not receive bevacizumab, the patients who received bevacizumab had significantly prolonged PFS (15 months vs. 7 months, P = 0.035) and OS (18 months vs. 12 months, P = 0.005), and were less likely to develop an adverse radiation effect (9 vs. 46%, P = 0.037).

3186,"New onset diplopia in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following concurrent chemoradiotherapy: Clinical features and etiology Purpose. To investigate the clinical features and etiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with new onset diplopia after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of NPC patients with new onset diplopia after concurrent chemoradiotherapy from 1998 to 2012 in a cancer center. Their clinical manifestations of ocular motor dysfunction in relation to etiology were investigated. Results. Twenty-three NPC patients with diplopia after concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in this study. Unilateral cranial VI palsy (91%) was the most common ocular motor dysfunction in these patients. The new onset diplopia in these patients was secondary to tumor recurrence in 12 cases (52%), radiation neuropathy in 8 cases (35%), and skull base osteoradionecrosis in 3 cases (13%). Patients with tumor recurrence and skull base osteoradionecrosis tended to present a rapid progression of the nerve palsy or severe ocular duction deficit. Patients with radiation neuropathy were often manifested by incomplete nerve palsy with insidious onset and slow progression. Patients with osteoradionecrosis were associated with poor prognosis. Conclusions. A new onset diplopia in NPC patients could be caused by tumor recurrence or treatment complications such as radiation neuropathy and osteoradionecrosis, and they show diverse clinical symptoms, course, and outcome.Copyright © 2015 Hui-Chuan Kau and Chieh-Chih Tsai.",Excluded

Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we compared the morphologic characteristics of ISR between first and second generation DES. Methods and Results: OCT was performed in 66 DES-ISR, defined as >. 50% angiographic diameter stenosis within the stented segment. Patients with ISR of first generation sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), paclitaxel eluting stents (PES) and second generation zotarolimus-eluting stents (ZES), everolimus-eluting stents (EES) and biolimus-eluting stents (BES) were enrolled. Quantitative and qualitative ISR tissue analysis was performed at 1-mm intervals along the entire stent, and categorised as homogeneous, heterogeneous and neo-atherosclerosis. The presence of microvessels and peri-strut low intensity area (PSLIA) was determined in all ISR. Neoatherosclerosis was identified by lipid, calcium and thin-cap fibro-atheroma (TCFA) like lesions. We compared the two DES generations at both early (<. 1. year) and late (>. 1. year) follow-ups.In second generation DES a heterogeneous pattern was prevalent both before and after 1. year (57.1% and 58.6% respectively). Neo-atherosclerosis was more common in the early period in first generation DES (19.4% vs 11.7%, p. <. 0.01), but after one year was more prevalent in second generation DES (7.0% vs 19.3%, p. <. 0.01). Similar prevalence of TCFAs was observed in both groups in all comparisons. Conclusion(s): When ISR restenosis occurs in second generation DES, the current data suggest a different time course and different morphological characteristics from first generation. Future prospective studies should evaluate the relationship between ISR morphology, time course and clinical events. © 2014 .",Excluded
1371,"Development of a medical examination program for former workers at a Department of Energy national laboratory BACKGROUND: As a part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Former Workers' Medical Surveillance Program, a Needs Assessment was conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The objective was to identify former LANL employees who may be at significant risk for occupational disease and determine whether a medical examination program could reduce morbidity or mortality. We describe the needs assessment approach used at LANL., METHODS: An algorithm was developed to make needs determinations. Information on factors including exposure, health impacts, size of exposed populations, and LANL worker concerns and recommendations were obtained. Each of these factors was scored from 1 to 3. The resulting factor sum was then multiplied by a binary (1 or 0) intervention suitability factor which was 1 if both of the following were available: (1) a screening test with acceptable sensitivity and specificity for the health outcome of concern; and (2) an intervention that decreases morbidity or mortality. This resulted in an Intervention Needs Score that was used to set priorities for the medical examination program for the estimated 35,000 former LANL workers., RESULTS: Analysis of the algorithm output suggested that six exposure categories be recommended for consideration in a medical examination program. Beryllium, asbestos, and noise clearly warranted inclusion. Lead and ionizing radiation required careful consideration regarding availability of screening tests. Solvents were problematic due to the lack of screening tests and suitable intervention in formerly exposed workers., CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm approach to the needs assessment at LANL documented that six chemical and physical agents should be considered as candidates for inclusion in a medical examination program for former workers.

The PSF variables were slightly lower in Group B, although the difference between groups was not statistically significant. The MTF parameters (double-pass value at 100%, 20%, and 9% contrast) were slightly higher in Group A (P = .07, P = .04, and P = .09, respectively). The mean objective scatter index was 1.83 +/- 0.91 (SD) in Group A and 2.00 +/- 0.74 in Group B (P = .43)., CONCLUSIONS: Both diffractive multifocal IOLs improved functional visual capacity at distance and near. Although the visual quality variables were slightly better in Group A than in Group B, the differences were not statistically significant.",Excluded
1782,"Retrospective assessment of self-reported exposure to medical ionizing radiation: results of a feasibility study conducted in Germany BACKGROUND: Exposure to medical ionizing radiation has been increasing over the past decades and constitutes the largest contributor to overall radiation exposure in the general population. While occupational exposures are generally monitored by national radiation protection agencies, individual data on medical radiation exposure for the general public are not regularly collected. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of assessing lifetime medical ionizing radiation exposure from diagnostic and therapeutic procedures retrospectively and prospectively within the framework of the German National Cohort study., METHODS: Retrospective assessment of individual medical radiation exposure was done using an interviewer-based questionnaire among 199 participants (87 men and 112 women) aged 20-69 randomly drawn from the general population at two recruitment locations in Germany. X-ray cards were distributed to 97 participants at one recruitment center to prospectively collect medical radiation exposure over a 6-month period. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to test differences in self-reported median examination frequencies for the variables age, sex, and recruitment center. To evaluate the self-reported information on radiological procedures, agreement was assessed using health insurance data as gold standard for the time period 2005 to 2010 from 8 participants., RESULTS: Participants reported a median of 7 lifetime X-ray examinations (interquartile range 4-13), and 42% (n = 83) reported having had a CT scan (2, IQR = 1-3). Women reported statistically significant more X-ray examinations than men. Individual frequencies above the 75th percentile (>=15 X-ray examinations) were predominantly observed among women and in individuals >50 years of age. The prospective exposure assessment yielded a 60% return-rate of X-ray cards (n = 58). 16 (28%) of the returned cards reported radiological examinations conducted during the 6-month period but generally lacked more detailed exposure information. X-ray examinations reported for the period for which health insurance data were available provided a moderately valid measure of individual medical radiation exposure., CONCLUSIONS: The assessment of more recent medical examinations seems in the German National Cohort study feasible, whereas lifetime medical radiation exposure appears difficult to assess via self-reports. Health insurance data may be a potentially useful tool for the assessment of individual data on medical radiation exposure both retrospectively and prospectively.",Excluded
972,"MR enterography in the investigation of unexplained abdominal pain Introduction: Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE) has an established role in the management of patients with small bowel (SB) Crohn's disease (CD)1 and has the advantages of diagnosing extra-enteric lesions which may be clinically significant2 and being free from the risks of radiation exposure. There is little published data on the use of MRE in the investigation of patients with unexplained chronic abdominal pain. Method(s): A retrospective review of casenotes was conducted of patients who underwent MRE at Southend University Hospital to investigate unexplained abdominal pain and suspected SB disease between January 2008 and October 2010. The patients did not have a pre-existing diagnosis of CD made by colonoscopy or capsule endoscopy (CE). Demographic data, symptoms, previous investigations and final diagnosis were recorded. MRE was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR scanner following a minimum 6-hour fast and preparation with Klean prep an hour prior to the scan. Two T2-weighted sequences single-shot fast spin-echo and fast imaging employing steady state acquisition were performed in the axial and coronal planes. Result(s): 181 patients (60 male, 121 female) underwent MRE: 43 also had diarrhoea, 14 weight loss and 13 vomiting. The median age was 39 years (range 13 - 85). MRE found clinically significant abnormalities in 33 patients (18.2%): 18/33 had a prior abdominal CT scan, MRE was used to clarify CT findings in 9/33. Findings are as follows: - 12 SB CD (3 CT suggestive) - 3 SB carcinoid tumour (1 CT suggestive, 1 CE suggestive) - 4 adhesional SB obstruction (2 CT abnormal) - 1 SB stricture - 1 gastric GIST - confirmed at resection (normal CT and gastroscopy) - 1 jejunal tumour - adenocarcinoma at resection (normal CT) - 1 duodenal mass with intussusception - villous adenoma at resection (OGD and CT suggestive) - 1 ovarian endometrioma and 1 renal cell carcinoma - confirmed at biopsy or resection - 1 peritoneal metastases - metastatic breast carcinoma at biopsy (CT: colonic thickening and free fluid) - 1 intussusception - 1 splenic mass (CT: splenic mass, granulomatous disease on resection) - 1 retroperitoneal nodes and splenomegaly (CT similar findings, further investigation hypogammaglobulinaemia) - 1 persistent vitello-intestinal cyst (CT normal, confirmed on resection) - 1 gallstones and cholecystitis - 1 PUJ obstruction (CT similar findings) - 1 colonic diverticular disease Conclusion(s): MRE is a useful investigation for unexplained chronic abdominal pain in patients not known to have CD. It yields clinically significant enteric and extra-enteric findings and carries no risk of radiation exposure.",Excluded
2919,"Effectiveness of gene expression profiling for response prediction of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy Background: Our aim was to determine whether the expression levels of specific genes could predict clinical radiosensitivity in human colorectal cancer. Method(s): Radioresistant colorectal cancer cell lines were established by repeated X-ray exposure (total, 100 Gy), and the gene expressions of the parent and radioresistant cell lines were compared in a microarray analysis. To verify the microarray data, we carried out a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of identified genes in clinical samples from 30 irradiated rectal cancer patients. Result(s): A comparison of the intensity data for the parent and three radioresistant cell lines revealed 17 upregulated and 142 downregulated genes in all radioresistant cell lines. Next, we focused on two upregulated genes, PTMA (prothymosin alpha) and EIF5a2 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A), in the radioresistant cell lines. In clinical samples, the expression of PTMA was significantly higher in the minor effect group than in the major effect group (P = 0.004), but there were no significant differences in EIF5a2 expression between the two groups. Conclusion(s): We identified radiation-related genes in colorectal cancer and demonstrated that PTMA may play an important role in radiosensitivity. Our findings suggest that PTMA may be a novel marker for predicting the effectiveness of radiotherapy in clinical cases. © Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2007.",Excluded
2641,"Mortality and cancer incidence following occupational radiation exposure: third analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers Mortality and cancer incidence were studied in the National Registry for Radiation Workers in, relative to earlier analyses, an enlarged cohort of 174 541 persons, with longer follow-up (to 2001) and, for the first time, cancer registration data. SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included

The experimental group (30 patients) was treated with ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" during the full course of radiotherapy, 4 times daily with 5 mL and 5 min each time. The control group (30 patients) rinsed the mouth in the same way with normal saline. Oral mucositis was assessed according to the RTOG criteria. The severity of mucositis and the degree of pain were recorded and photographed. Patients shouldn't be treated with other drugs until the level of oral mucositis reached above grade III. The results were statistically analyzed using Stata 12.0 software packages., RESULTS: Age, gender, radiotherapy techniques and dose showed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P>0.05). The first onset of oral mucositis in the experimental group was later than that in the control group (11.0 times:9.1 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of pain at the early time of radiotherapy was lower (36.7%: 70.0%, P<0.05). Also, the onset time of grade III oral mucositis in the emperimental group was later than that in the control group (18.9 times:15.9 times,P<0.05), and the incidence of grade III oral mucositis in the experimental group was lower (63.3% vs. 90.0%, P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: ""Xinjingjie mouthrinse"" is worthwhile to be used in clinic because it can delay the occurrence time of radiation-induced oral mucositis, alleviate pain and reduce the indication of grade III oral mucositis.""",Excluded
2498,"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning in Single-Dose Total-Body Gamma-Irradiated Rhesus Monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ) In this study, the effects of a potentially lethal radiation exposure on the brain for long-term cognitive sequelae were investigated using Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) adopted from other facilities after analysis of acute radiation response via the Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR) network. Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included
1767,"Right ventricular function in patients with acute pulmonary embolism: Analysis with electrocardiography-synchronized multi-detector row CT Purpose: To prospectively assess electrocardiography (ECG)-synchronized multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) for the evaluation of right ventricular (RV) function in patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE). Material(s) and Method(s): All patients gave informed consent after the study details, including radiation exposure, were explained; institutional ethical committee approval was obtained. Nonsynchronized multi-detector row CT of the chest was performed in 66 consecutive patients (29 men, 37 women; mean age, 58 years +/- 15 [standard deviation]) who were suspected of having PE. ECG-synchronized cardiac multi-detector row CT was performed to assess cardiac function. Dimension ratios for the RV and left ventricle (LV) were measured on nonsynchronized transverse and angulated four-chamber views. Furthermore, the RV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were measured on ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT scans. An independent samples t test was performed to compare the mean value of different groups. An analysis of variance post hoc test was performed to investigate whether the values of the variables varied between groups. Result(s): PE was detected in 29 of 66 patients. The location of PE was categorized as central (n = 17) or peripheral (n = 12). The RV/LV dimension ratio was larger on the four-chamber view (P = .002), and RV end-systolic volume was larger (P = .01) and ejection fraction was lower (P = .01) in patients with PE. The RV end-systolic volumes and RV/LV volume ratios, as assessed by using ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT, showed significant differences (P < .005) between patients with central PE and those with peripheral PE. However, the RV/LV dimensions on nonsynchronized images revealed no significant differences. Conclusion(s): Retrospective ECG-synchronized multi-detector row CT facilitates detection of RV dysfunction, depending on pulmonary embolus location. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): The term small round blue cell"" is frequently used only as a cursory radiologic-pathologic correlation of aggressive tumors throughout the body. We evaluate the imaging characteristics, patient demographics, and pathologic findings in 88 patients with biopsy-proven small round blue cell tumors in the thorax performed within the past 10 years at our institution. All cases included imaging studies of conventional radiography, CT, or PET. Result(s): Review of the pathology database for thoracic small round blue cell tumors examined at our institution in the past 10 years revealed 88 cases in 45 male patients and 43 female patients. There were 66 cases of small cell carcinoma, seven cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma, five cases of Hodgkin lymphoma, three cases of Ewing sarcoma, three cases of extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, and one case each of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and peripheral T cell lymphoma. Patients ranged from 10 to 90 years old with an average age of 55.8 years. The oldest average age of presentation was seen in the small cell carcinoma subset, with 68.7 years. Most patients presented with adenopathy or pulmonary nodules/masses. Small cell tumors presented most commonly as smoothly marginated, multilobulated lesions with an average size on presentation of 5.9 cm. For each tumor subtype, we present histologic sections stained with H and E showing large blue nuclei with scant cytoplasms and describe distinguishing immunohistochemical and molecular chromosomal markers.

1104,"Effectiveness of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography as a Guide for Palliative Radiation Therapy for Spinal Metastases Objective: As back pain is the presenting symptom in 95% of patients with epidural spinal metastases, appropriately identifying and treating the most symptomatic levels can provide significant palliation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of combined positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to identify spinal metastases with high metabolic activity and guide radiotherapy. We sought to correlate improvement in back pain with reduction in standard uptake value (SUV) after treatment. Method(s): Retrospective review was performed of 72 patients with spinal metastases treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy at a single center between 2002 and 2014. PET/CT was used to calculate SUVs for spinal metastases, and treatment planning was based on PET/CT results. Preoperative and postoperative pain levels were assessed in all patients. Result(s): Reduction in pain scores was found in 78% of treated patients. A significant reduction in pain was identified in patients with >5 metastases compared with fewer lesions (P < 0.05). Degree of change in SUV did not correlate significantly with pain relief. However, comparing pretreatment and posttreatment PET/CT, patients with improved pain consistently displayed decreased SUV. Conclusion(s): PET/CT was shown to be a useful adjunct in radiation treatment planning with change in SUV correlating with symptomatic improvement. This study paves the way for future prospective studies to further assess utility and cost-effectiveness of this imaging modality in radiation treatment planning for spinal metastases.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
687,"The use of a fully integrated electronic medical record to minimize cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from CT scanning to detect urinary tract calculi In order to determine the effects of implementation of an electronic medical record on rates of repeat computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED) setting, we analyzed the utilization of CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB) for the detection of urinary tract calculi for periods before and after the implementation of a hospital-wide electronic medical record system. Rates of repeat CT scanning within a 6-month period of previous scan were determined pre- and post-implementation and compared. Prior to implementation, there was a 6-month repeat rate of 6.2 % compared with the post-implementation period, which was associated with a 6-month repeat rate of 4.1 %. Statistical analysis using a two-sample, one-tailed t test for difference of means was associated with a p value of 0.00007. This indicates that the implementation of the electronic medical record system was associated with a 34 % decrease in 6-month repeat CT KUB scans. We conclude that the use of an electronic medical record can be associated with a decrease in utilization of unnecessary repeat CT imaging, leading to decreased cumulative lifetime risk for cancer in these patients and more efficient utilization of ED and radiologic resources. © 2013 Am Soc Emergency Radiol.",Excluded

2394,"The benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy Background: Many patients with cancer experience depression and anxiety, and an associated decrease in quality of life (QOL) during radiation therapy (RT). The main objective of the study was to determine the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients who received RT. Method(s): Patients with cancer (n = 178) who agreed to participate in the study were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 89) or the control arm (n = 89). Patients in the intervention group received psychosocial care during RT, whereas the control group received RT only. The benefits of the intervention were evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) to survey health-related QOL. The association between intervention and survival was also assessed. Result(s): Patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm showed significant improvements on symptoms of depression (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05), health-related QOL (p < 0.05) (i.e. better global health status, and physical and emotional functioning, and less insomnia) when compared with controls. In the subset analysis, female patients, those that received high dose irradiation, and those that underwent adjuvant chemotherapy could benefit more from psychosocial intervention. There was no difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (2-year DFS 79.8% in the intervention arm and 76.4% in the control arm; p = 0.527) and overall survival (OS) (2-year OS 83.1% in the intervention arm and 84.3% in the control arm; p = 0.925). Conclusion(s): Psychosocial intervention is a cost-effective approach that can improve a patient's mood and QOL both during and after RT.

Most of the patients could be omitted for abdominal computed tomography (CT). Despite high sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT, in addition to high medical cost, there are risks from radiation exposure and adverse reaction from use of contrast media. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence of KUB injury on abdominal CT in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-one studies of abdominal CT performed during 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for KUB injury (categorized by AAST organ injury scale) by consensus of two experienced radiologists. Result(s): KUB injury was found in 36.6% from all selected CT studies. Almost all cases could be managed conservatively. The cutoff point of microscopic hematuria at 20 cells/hpf has sensitivity 80% and specificity 46.15%. Conclusion(s): One-third of the patients have KUB injury but almost all of them could be conservatively managed. We proposed that the cutoff point of hematuria be equivalent to or greater than 20 cells/hpf to be one of the indicators for predicting KUB injury that needs radiological evaluation; but it should be carefully considered along with clinical information.Copyright © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

However, the potential occupational health effects are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of health problems among personnel staff working in interventional cardiology/cardiac electrophysiology and correlate them with the length of occupational radiation exposure., METHODS AND RESULTS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to collect demographic information, work-related information, lifestyle-confounding factors, all current medications, and health status. A total number of 746 questionnaires were properly filled comprising 466 exposed staff (281 males; 44+/-9 years) and 280 unexposed subjects (179 males; 43+/-7years). Exposed personnel included 218 interventional cardiologists and electrophysiologists (168 males; 46+/-9 years); 191 nurses (76 males; 42+/-7 years), and 57 technicians (37 males; 40+/-12 years) working for a median of 10 years (quartiles: 5-24 years).

630,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2199,"Agreement between SPECT V/Q scan and CT angiography in patients with high clinical suspicion of PE Objective: To track agreement between single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT) V/Q and CT angiography in patients with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE). If significant agreement occurs, a case could be made for more frequent use of chest radiography followed by SPECT V/Q scanning given its lower risk profile. Introduction: Diagnosis of PE can be difficult. CT pulmonary angiography (CTA) is the preferred initial test, but may be indeterminate, is a significant source of ionizing radiation, and is contraindicated in renal insufficiency. SPECT ventilation/perfusion imaging (V/Q) is therefore preferred in certain patients. Method(s): Two thousand nine hundred and twenty patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in New York City were screened and 100 consecutive high-risk patients who required both CTA and V/Q for an initial indeterminate or negative imaging test despite a high pre-test probability were identified. The agreement between these tests was evaluated. Result(s): There was no significant agreement between CTA and V/Q when positive, negative and indeterminate results were included (K = 0.18, SE = 0.09, p = 0.051). However, in the presence of a positive finding on either test, there was substantial agreement between the two (K = 0.62, SE = 0.27, p = 0.02). In 30 cases in which CTA was indeterminate, V/Q was diagnostic 93 % of the time. In 12 cases in which V/Q was indeterminate, CTA was diagnostic 83 % of the time and negative in 100 % of those cases. Conclusion(s): In the presence of an indeterminate CTA in patients with high clinical suspicion of PE, SPECT V/Q often provides a diagnosis. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Excluded
2913,"Can we achieve a radionuclide radiation dose equal to or less than that of 99mTc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate bone scintigraphy with a low-dose 18F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET of diagnostic quality? PURPOSE: F-Sodium fluoride is a bone tracer with a high signal-to-noise ratio, but its dosimetry is higher than that of Tc-labeled phosphonates at the recommended activities. The study's purpose was to determine whether the reduction by half of F-sodium fluoride-injected activity, mimicked by a short-timed reconstruction image, simulating a total dose less than or equal to that of Tc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate scintigraphy, had an impact on the accuracy of PET semiquantitative measurements and image quality. METHOD(S): Whole-body time-of-flight F-sodium fluoride PET/computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prospectively from 40 adult patients for detection of bone metastases. F-Sodium fluoride was administered according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) practice guidelines. From the acquired 1 min/bed position list-mode data, 30-s reconstructions were extracted. Measurements of maximum standard uptake value were recorded with a region of interest applied to the same location on the 1-min and 30-s images, which were displayed side by side, and were analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. A masked reading was performed by two senior nuclear medicine physicians who counted the foci of visually increased uptake. RESULT(S): Bland-Altman plots showed an excellent agreement between the maximum standard uptake value measurements of the 60- and 30-s images. The paired Wilcoxon test results between the corresponding 60- and 30-s images read by masked readers A and B were not significant (P=0.15 and 0.19, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Reducing acquisition duration by half or injecting half of the activity recommended by the EANM and SNM practice guidelines can lead to F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET images of diagnostic quality, achieving a radiation dose less than or equal to that of Tc-labeled phosphonates.

172,"Postoperative irradiation for pterygium: retrospective analysis of 1,253 patients from the Osaka University Hospital BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation of ocular pterygium is considered a valuable treatment supplementation after surgical therapy. Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence.

Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

1929,"Synthesis and application of a thermoplastic plate of poly(Lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) for radiation therapy In this study, the poly(lactide-epsilon-caprolactone) (P(LA-CL)) copolymer is synthesized by ring-opening polymerization with glycol used as a molecular weight regulator to adjust the molecular weight of the polymer. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results demonstrate that the P(LA-CL) copolymer is successfully synthesized, and that the molecular weight can be controlled by the glycol content. The thermoplastic plate is processed with triallyl isocyanurate as a cross-linking agent by a single-screw extruder followed by gamma-ray irradiation. Shape memory test results show that the material had the desired shape memory effect, with deformation recovery rates reaching 100%. After secondary stretching of samples, deformation recovery rates are unchanged. The results of mechanical property measurements indicate that with added lactide, the tensile strength is improved and shore hardness is increased by 20%-30%. Data from clinical trials also reveal that the material has good clinical effects in thermoplastic membrane fixation.Copyright © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
2736,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance? It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included
3360,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for medically refractory multiple sclerosis-related tremor OBJECTIVE Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to severe intention tremor in some patients. In several case reports, conventional radiotherapy has been reported to possibly exacerbate MS. Radiosurgery dramatically limits normal tissue irradiation to potentially avoid such a problem. Gamma Knife thalamotomy (GKT) has been established as a minimally invasive technique that is effective in treating essential tremor and Parkinson's disease- related tremor. The goal in this study was to analyze the outcomes of GKT in patients suffering from medically refractory MS-related tremor. METHODS The authors retrospectively studied the outcomes of 15 patients (mean age 46.5 years) who had undergone GKT over a 15-year period (1998-2012). Fourteen patients underwent GKT at a median maximum dose of 140 Gy (range 130-150 Gy) using a single 4-mm isocenter. One patient underwent GKT at a dose of 140 Gy delivered via two 4-mm isocenters (3 mm apart). The posteroinferior region of the nucleus ventralis intermedius (VIM) was the target for all GKTs. The Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale was used to evaluate tremor, handwriting, drawing, and drinking. The median time to the last follow-up was 39 months. RESULTS After GKT, 13 patients experienced tremor improvement on the side contralateral to surgery. Four patients noted tremor arrest at a median of 4.5 months post-GKT. Seven patients had excellent tremor improvement and 6 had good tremor improvement. Four patients noted excellent functional improvement, 8 noted good functional improvement, and 1 noted satisfactory functional improvement. Three patients experienced diminished tremor relief at a median of 18 months after radiosurgery. Two patients experienced temporary adverse radiation effects. Another patient developed a large thalamic cyst 60 months after GKT, which was successfully managed with Ommaya reservoir placement. CONCLUSIONS Gamma Knife thalamotomy was found to be a minimally invasive and beneficial procedure for medically refractory MS tremor.Copyright © AANS 2018.",Excluded
1788,"Complex fractures of the distal humerus in the elderly: Is primary total elbow arthroplasty a valid treatment alternative? A series of 20 cases Introduction: Distal humerus fractures are fairly rare. But as our population ages, these fractures become more complex and the choice of treatment more delicate. Poor bone quality results in many technical problems and the fixation hardware stability remains at risk. The goal of this study was to evaluate the functional recovery and morbidity of complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients when treated with elbow prosthesis. Hypothesis: Good functional recovery can be achieved with a total joint replacement. Patients and Methods: This series consisted of 20 patients (18 women and two men) having an average age of 80years (range 65-93, median 80). Based on the AO classification, there were two Type A2 fractures, two Type B fractures, 15 Type C fractures and one fracture that could not be classified because of previous rheumatoid disease history at this elbow. Two fractures were open. In two cases, the olecranon was also fractured. Treatment consisted of the implantation of a Coonrad-Morrey, hinge-type total elbow prosthesis (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA). The Mayo Clinic surgical approach was used 17 times and the transolecranon approach was used three times. Primary arthroplasty was performed in 19 cases and the surgery was performed after six weeks of conservative treatment (diagnostic delay) in one case. Unrestricted motion was allowed after surgery, but a maximum of 0.5kg could be carried during the first 3months; this was subsequently increased to 2.5kg. Result(s): Fifteen of the 20 patients were available for reevaluation with an average follow-up of 3.6. years (range 1.7-5.5, median 3.4). Four patients had died and one was lost to follow-up. The average range of motion was 97degree (range 60-130degree), comprising an average flexion of 130degree (range 110-140degree) and average loss of extension of 33degree (range 0-80degree). Pronation and supination were normal. The average Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS) was 83 (range 60-100, median 80). X-rays revealed seven cases of radiolucent lines, with two being progressive. There was no visible wear of the polyethylene bushings at the hinge. Six patients had moderate periarticular heterotopic ossification. The two cases of olecranon osteotomy and one case of olecranon fracture had healed. There were no surgical site infections but two cases of ulnar compression, one of which required neurolysis. There was one case of humeral component loosening after 6. years, but the implant was not changed. Discussion(s): The clinical range of motion results were comparable to published data. The functional scores were slightly lower, mainly because of the pain factor. The initial results were encouraging and consistent with published data as long as the indications were well-chosen. Based on this retrospective study, total elbow arthroplasty can be a valid alternative in the surgeon's treatment armamentarium for complex distal humerus fractures in elderly patients who have moderate functional demands. Our results support our hypothesis, since we found good functional recovery without associated morbidity.

852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
30,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

1035,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded

BACKGROUND:: Conflicting data have emerged over the last decade regarding the effect of preoperative CRT on AL. METHOD(S):: We reviewed 1437 consecutive patients with rectal cancer who underwent low anterior resection (LAR) at our institution between 2005 and 2012. AL evaluated as grade C was the primary endpoint, as proposed by the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer in 2010. The patients were treated with (n = 360) or without (n = 1077) preoperative CRT. The total radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Multivariate and propensity score matching analyses were used to compensate for the differences in some baseline characteristics. RESULT(S):: The preoperative CRT group contained more patients with the following characteristics, older age, male sex, smoker, advanced stage tumor, lower/mid rectal tumor location, ultra-LAR, and diverting stoma, than the non-preoperative CRT group (all Ps < 0.05). Postoperative AL occurred in 91 patients (6.3%). Before propensity score matching, the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 5.9%, respectively (P = 0.293). After propensity score matching, the 2 groups were nearly balanced except for the initial stage and the length of the surgeonE's career, and the incidence of AL in patients with or without preoperative CRT was 7.5% and 8.1%, respectively (P = 0.781). CONCLUSION(S):: We did not observe that preoperative CRT increased the risk of postoperative AL after LAR in patients with rectal cancer, using propensity score matching analysis. © 2013 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",Excluded

1707,"The small molecule drug CBL0137 increases the level of DNA damage and the efficacy of radiotherapy for glioblastoma Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor with inevitable recurrence. This is in part due to a highly malignant cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation of tumor cells that is particularly resistant to conventional treatments, including radiotherapy. Here we show that CBL0137, a small molecule anti-cancer agent, sensitizes GBM CSCs to radiotherapy. CBL0137 sequesters the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex to chromatin, resulting in cytotoxicity preferentially within tumor cells. We show that when combined with radiotherapy, CBL0137 inhibited GBM CSC growth and resulted in more DNA damage in the CSCs compared to irradiation or drug alone. Using an in vivo subcutaneous model, we showed that the frequency of GBM CSCs was reduced when tumors were pretreated with CBL0137 and then exposed to irradiation. Survival studies with orthotopic GBM models resulted in significantly extended survival for mice treated with combinatorial therapy. As GBM CSCs contribute to the inevitable recurrence in patients, targeting them is imperative. This work establishes a new treatment paradigm for GBM that sensitizes CSCs to irradiation and may ultimately reduce tumor recurrence.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
2952,"Radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor in adults, is usually rapidly fatal. The current standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma is surgical resection to the extent feasible, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. In this trial we compared radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus temozolomide, given concomitantly with and after radiotherapy, in terms of efficacy and safety. METHOD(S): Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy alone (fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week for 6 weeks, for a total of 60 Gy) or radiotherapy plus continuous daily temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy), followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter for 5 days during each 28-day cycle). The primary end point was overall survival. RESULT(S): A total of 573 patients from 85 centers underwent randomization. The median age was 56 years, and 84 percent of patients had undergone debulking surgery. At a median follow-up of 28 months, the median survival was 14.6 months with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 12.1 months with radiotherapy alone. The unadjusted hazard ratio for death in the radiotherapy-plus-temozolomide group was 0.63 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.75; P<0.001 by the log-rank test). The two-year survival rate was 26.5 percent with radiotherapy plus temozolomide and 10.4 percent with radiotherapy alone. Concomitant treatment with radiotherapy plus temozolomide resulted in grade 3 or 4 hematologie toxic effects in 7 percent of patients. CONCLUSION(S): The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with minimal additional toxicity.

2718,"Granulocytopoietic precursor cells and regulatory factors in irradiated human bone marrow The effects of irradiation on committed granulopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-C) and granulopoietic humoral regulators were studied in 17 X-ray treated patients with carcinoma of the breast or of the prostate. After 45 or 70 Gy, the CFU-C decreased to 14 +/- 10% in irradiated areas. This remaining CFU-C population probably reflects a combination of radioresistance and survival in situ, and migration of CFU-C from protected marrow areas. The frequency of peripheral blood CFU-C did not change after irradiation. Endogenous colony stimulating activity (CSA), i.e., release of CSA within the marrow cell population, in post-irradiation bone marrow persisted on roughly the same level, indicating a fairly low radiosensitivity of the CSA-producing cells in the bone marrow. Colony stimulating activity in peripheral blood cells and serum remained unchanged, but there were great interindividual variations, and some of the patients with hypercellularity and CFU-C increase in nonirradiated marrow areas also had increased CSA.

The particle environments are taken from the orbit-averaged NASA AP8 and AE8 models at solar cycle maxima and minima. The transport of energetic particles through space suit materials and body tissue is calculated by using the NASA LaRC HZETRN code for hadrons and a recently developed deterministic transport code, ELTRN, for electrons. The doses within the CAM and CAF models are determined from energy deposition at given target points along 968 directional rays convergent on the points and are evaluated for several points on the skin and within the body.

A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements. Furthermore, honey is a putative nutritional with a variety of health effects, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic. The present study evaluated the effects of probiotic with or without honey on radiation-induced diarrhea.

2187,"Pulmonary nodules detected at lung cancer screening: Interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements Purpose: To retrospectively determine interobserver variability of semiautomated volume measurements of pulmonary nodules and the potential reasons for variability. Material(s) and Method(s): The Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) is a lung cancer screening study that includes men between the ages of 50 and 75 years who are current or former heavy smokers. The NELSON project was approved by the Dutch Ministry of Health and the ethics committee of each participating hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. For this study, the authors evaluated 1200 consecutive low-dose computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest obtained during the NELSON project and identified subjects who had at least one 50-500-mm3 nodule. One local and one central observer independently evaluated the scans and measured the volume of any detected nodule by using semiautomated software. Noncalcified solid nodules with volumes of 15-500 mm3 were included in this study if they were fully surrounded by air (intraparenchymal) and were detected by both observers. The mean volume and the difference between both measurements were calculated for all nodules. Intermeasurement agreement was assessed with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Potential reasons for discrepancies were assessed. Result(s): There were 232 men (mean age, 60 years; age range, 52-73 years) with 430 eligible nodules (mean volume, 77.8 mm3; range, 15.3-499.5 mm3). Interobserver correlation was high (r = 0.99). No difference in volume was seen for 383 nodules (89.1%). Discrepant results were obtained for 47 nodules (10.9%); in 16 cases (3.7%), the discrepancy was larger than 10%. The most frequent cause of variability was incomplete segmentation due to an irregular shape or irregular margins. Conclusion(s): In a minority (approximately 11%) of small solid intraparenchymal nodules, semiautomated measurements are not completely reproducible and, thus, may cause errors in the assessment of nodule growth. For small or irregularly shaped nodules, an observer should check the segmentation shown by the program. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded
3054,"Mitochondrial DNA somatic mutations are frequent in nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common cancers in southern China, and is highly sensitive to radiotherapy. The control region (D-loop) of mtDNA is a polymorphic region in which point mutations occur frequently. In this study, point mutation and common deletion (CD) mutations were investigated in 23 samples of NPC tumor tissue and in the radiation-treated NPC cell line CNE2. Polymorphisms at 72 (7.28%, 72/988) nucleotide positions in D-loop region and 6 (0.75%, 6/795) nucleotide positions in part of the functional gene encoding regions were detected in all NPC patients. Of the detected polymorphisms, 8 are novel. These variants are nonencoding transitions, including np292T-->C , np517G-del, np16038A-->G, np513G-del, np16242C-->A, np513G-del, np16242C-->A and np15787T-->C transition. A total of 39 point mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA were detected in 43.5% (10/23) of the NPC patients. Three point mutations in the functional gene encoding regions of mtDNA were detected in only 8.7% (2/23) of NPC patients. The effect of he mutation at np709G-->A in the 12sRNA gene is unclear, and the A-->G substitution at np15769 in the cytochrome B gene is a synonymous mutation. The C-->T substitution at np15970 in the T Psi C loop of the tRNA(pro) gene could alter the position of the proline residue. After irradiation, the survival fraction of CNE2 cells decreased as X-ray dose increased. Moreover, X-ray radiation could induce apoptosis and the CD mutation in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but did not induce mtDNA point mutations. A positive correlation between the apoptosis index and the ratio of CD/WT mtDNA was observed in irradiated CNE2 cells. Our results suggest that CD mutation induced by irradiation is one of the late events after apoptosis of the cancer cells, and the mtDNA CD mutation may associated with the susceptibility of NPC cells to IR-induced apoptosis.",Excluded
1638,"Surgical treatment of the squamous cell carcinoma of tongue and floor of mouth: Post-operative radiotherapy effect Assessment of the postoperative irradiation effectiveness for improvement local control of squamous cell carcinoma of tongue and floor of the mouth in stages III and IV. Study Design: clinical retrospective. Material(s) and Method(s): a retrospective case-series of 72 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of tongue and floor of mouth who underwent surgery. The local control rate was assessed in front of stage, surgical margins and postoperative radiotherapy. Result(s): local recurrences were diagnosed in 28 (38%) patients. Only T stage and lymph node metastases were related to recurrences in the primary site. Control of disease in the primary site was achieved in 80% of pN0 patients and postoperative radiotherapy didn't show any effect in this group. Conclusion(s): advanced local disease without lymph node metastases can be treated with surgery only.",Excluded
669,"Helicobacter gastritis induces changes in the oxyntic mucosa indistinguishable from the effects of proton pump inhibitors A causal relationship between oxyntic glands dilatation with protruding parietal cells, referred to as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effects, and PPI use has been suspected but not established. We designed this study to evaluate the association between these changes and the use of PPIs and histamine 2-receptor blockers (H2-blockers). We obtained five Sydney System-compliant biopsy specimens from patients recruited into a therapeutic trial for H. pylori. Medication history with details on PPI and H 2-blockers use was collected. Two blinded pathologists graded gastritis and the intensity of putative PPI effects using a 0 to 3 scale. PPI and H2-blocker use was then disclosed and the accuracy of pathologists' assessment was analyzed. There were 138 H. pylori-negative and 104 positive patients. In H. pylori-negative patients the histologic assessment for PPI use had 77.5% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 86.9% and a negative predictive value of 35.9%. In H. pylori-positive patients, sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity 26.1%. Positive and negative predictive values were 55.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Neither glandular dilatations nor parietal cell protrusions related to H2-blocker use. We conclude that these changes are associated with PPI use only in H. pylori-negative subjects. In H. pylori gastritis, so-called PPI-effects were equally prevalent in PPI-users and non-users, indicating that other factors are involved in the induction of oxyntic cell hyperplasia. We suggest that comments regarding the supposed evidence of PPI use are too often wrong to be useful and should be avoided in the diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

3045,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes and susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population The excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency complementation group 1 (ERCC1), and X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) genes appear to protect mammalian cells from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation. We conducted a large case-control study to investigate the association of polymorphisms in ERCC1 C118T, ERCC1 C8092A, XRCC1 A194T, XRCC1 A194T, and XRCC3 C241T, with glioma risk in a Chinese population. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, using the MassARRAY IPLEX platform, in 443 glioma cases and 443 controls. Association analyses based on an chi2 test and binary logistic regression were performed to determine the odds ratio (OR) and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for each SNP. For XRCC1 Arg194Trp, the variant genotype T/T was strongly associated with a lower risk of glioma cancer when compared with the wild type C/C (OR = 2.45, 95% CI = 1.43-4.45). Individuals carrying the XRCC1 399A allele had an increased risk of glioma (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.02-1.64). The XRCC3 241T/T genotype was associated with a strong increased glioma risk (OR = 3.78, 95% CI = 1.86-9.06). Further analysis of the interactions of two susceptibility-associated SNPs, XRCC1 Arg194Trp and XRCC3 Thr241Met, showed that the combination of the XRCC1 194T and XRCC3 241T alleles brought a large increase in glioma risk (OR = 2.75, 95% CI = 1.54-4.04). XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and XRCC3 C241T, appear to be associated with susceptibility to glioma in a Chinese population. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
2040,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included
846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded
129,"[Large mantle fields--indication, technic, tolerance and side effects] In our Department, the technique of large mantle fields has proved to be a good therapeutic means for supradiaphragmatic and infradiaphragmatic irradiation of several lymph node groups in one irradiation field. With this technique the lymph node groups needing a treatment can be irradiated without overlappings or gaps, and thus the therapy reliability is considerably improved. The side effects are limited with respect to the large volume dose, in the individual case they can easily be eliminated by reducing the single dose. Gastrointestinal side effects can be controlled by chemotherapy in a satisfactory manner. Only in very few cases the modifications of the white blood count necessitated a short interruption of the therapy cycle. Furthermore, the simplified and easily reproducible focussing of the individual fields is especially appreciated by the technical staff.",Excluded
