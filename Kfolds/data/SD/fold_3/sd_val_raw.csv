3663,"NOS1-, NOS3-, PIK3CA-, and MAPK pathways in skin following radiation therapy Background: Essential molecular pathways such as the MAPK pathway, NO system, or the influence of PIK3CA as an oncogene are known to regulate fundamental signalling networks. However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs. Additional studies should be carried out to identify possible starting points for therapeutic interventions.Copyright © The Author(s). 2017.",Included
4036,"Fat depot specific differences in mRNA expression of novel loci associated with waist-hip ratio Background and aims: Body fat distribution is one of the main predictors of obesity-associated complications. It might be hypothesised that changes in the gene expression or in gene function caused by genetic variants may result in metabolic alterations related to obesity. We therefore investigated the adipose tissue expression profiles of 6 loci (TBX15, WARS, PIGC, STAB1, GRB14, ZNRF3), identified in a recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) for WHR, as their exact role in fat distribution remains largely unknown. Effects of genetic variants within these loci (rs984222 TBX15/WARS; rs6784615 STAB1; rs1011731 PIGC; rs4823006 ZNFR3; rs10195252 GRB14) on gene expression, WHR, and obesity related traits were examined. Material(s) and Method(s): Paired samples of visceral (vis) and subcutaneous (sc) adipose tissue were obtained from 297 Caucasian men and women who underwent open abdominal surgery. Abdominal vis and sc fat area was calculated using CT scans and percentage body fat was measured by dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry. Gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR by using TaqMan methodology. SNP genotyping was done using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay. Differences in mRNA expression between vis and sc adipose tissue were assessed using the paired t-test. Correlation analyses were carried out and multivariate linear relationships were assessed by generalized linear regression models. Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered to provide nominal evidence for association (adj. age, gender). Result(s): Differential expression between vis and sc adipose tissue could be observed for all tested genes. Except for STAB1 with higher mRNA expression in sc adipose tissue of males vs. females, there were no gender differences in gene expression in either tissue. Surprisingly, no correlation between WHR and fat mRNA expression of any of the genes was observed except for WARS whose expression in vis fat correlated positively with WHR in men. However, mRNA expression of several genes (e.g. WARS, PIGC, STAB1) correlated with BMI. Further, STAB1 expression in sc adipose tissue correlated with fat mass, and ZNRF3 expression in sc tissue correlated negatively with vis fat area. In addition, vis as well as sc expression of WARS and PIGC correlated negatively with both vis and sc fat area. Nominal associations were detected for rs984222 and TBX15 mRNA expression, rs4823006 and ZNFR3 mRNA expression, and rs10195252 and GRB14 mRNA expression, whereat rs984222 was also associated with BMI, sc and vis fat area as well as the GRB14 SNP with waist and waist-hip ratio in men (adj. age, BMI). Conclusion(s): Besides rather moderate correlations of the expression levels with BMI or WHR, the most striking feature of expression of the 6 examined genes is the inter-depot variability as well as correlations with the vis and sc fat area. Our data further support the role of genes from recent GWAS in the regulation of fat distribution.",Excluded
4431,"Stereotactic radiosurgery of small intracranial tumors: neuropathological correlation in three patients The mechanism by which radiosurgery can stop the growth of some tumors is poorly understood, in part because postmortem neuropathological findings in patients have been reported only rarely. To define further the effects of radiosurgery, we present the correlation among clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data in three patients with different intracranial tumors who died between 2 and 39 weeks after radiosurgery. The target volumes in two patients with malignant tumors showed sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis. In the third patient, who had a benign acoustic nerve tumor, neuropathological examination found intratumoral hemorrhage and cyst formation, but no necrosis. Radiosurgery appears to cause acute necrosis of malignant cells, although its effectiveness may be limited by the infiltrative nature of some tumors. In benign tumors, necrosis following radiosurgery is relatively delayed, and may not be required for growth arrest.",Excluded
4255,"[Enterosorption and therapeutic plasmapheresis in the intensive therapy of patients with acute leukemia and of persons who were victims of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station] The paper reports on the preliminary experience of treatment of those patients having been the victims to the reactor accident at the Chernobyl NPP as well as of those with acute and chronic leukoses, having received courses of modern cytostatic therapy. The patients were exposed to therapeutic plasmapheresis and enterosorption as part of a complex conventional treatment programme. The conclusion the authors have come to is as follows: enterosorption strikingly reduces manifestations of ""cytostatic disease""; the use of plasmapheresis in those persons having been previously exposed to small dose chronic radiation, makes for improvement of clinical and laboratory values but further studies are warranted to determine indications for therapeutic plasmapheresis.",Excluded
4591,"Salivary and serum proteomics in head and neck carcinomas: Before and after surgery and radiotherapy Several body fluids have been evaluated as new sources for cancer biomarker discovery. In this context, salivary and serum proteomics seem promising diagnostic and predictive tools for head and neck diseases. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of saliva and serum from patients presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared the results before and after therapy. In saliva of cancer patients, we observed an altered protein profile, including over-expression of PLUNC and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein. Both proteins may contribute to control tumor growth and, therefore, represent targets for new analysis. We also detected serotransferrin and a modified transthyretin form with altered levels in serum from patients. Comparing preoperative and postreatment samples, the results showed that the protein profile after treatment reverted to a pattern closer to those observed for controls. These results add information on the role of secreted proteins in the cancer process and emphasize the potential of saliva and serum analysis for diagnosis and monitoring of HNSCC. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

4146,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) of the socket: Management of extensive tumors with interferon PURPOSE:: To describe the clinical features and management of extensive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (squamous cell carcinoma) of the socket. METHOD(S):: Retrospective interventional case series. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNa2b) eye drops (1 million units/cc) 4 times daily and IFNa2b sublesional injection (5 million units/0.5cc to 8 million units/0.8 cc) were delivered for tumor control. Participants were 3 patients with ocular prosthesis who developed extensive socket OSSN. Tumor control was graded as complete regression, partial regression, or no regression. RESULT(S):: OSSN was detected in the socket at age 60, 43, and 20 years in patients who had worn ophthalmic prostheses for 54, 26, and 13 years, respectively. The patients had chronic discharge and irritation (n = 3) managed with intermittent topical corticosteroids (n = 2). There were no predisposing factors of cigarette exposure, radiation exposure, eczema, systemic immune suppression, or organ transplantation. The prosthesis fit well with nonirritative edges. At presentation, OSSN was subtle (n = 3), vascular (n = 3), and multifocal (n = 3), with largest lesions or confluence of lesions measuring 20, 25, and 20 mm, respectively. The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN. Combined topical and injection IFNa2b could represent a potentially effective therapy for this condition. © 2011 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.",Excluded
4916,"Reduced intensity VEPEMB regimen compared with standard ABVD in elderly Hodgkin lymphoma patients: Results from a randomized trial on behalf of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) Survival rates for elderly Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) have not improved substantially in recent years, mainly because of a lack of prospective randomized studies, due to difficulties in enrolling patients. Between 2002 and 2006, 54 untreated HL patients, aged between 65 and 80 years and considered 'non-frail' according to a comprehensive geriatric evaluation, were enrolled into a phase III randomized trial to compare a reduced-intensity regimen (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, prednisone, etoposide, mitoxantrone, bleomycin; VEPEMB) with standard ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Seventeen patients were in early stage (I-IIA), while 37 were advanced stage. Median age was 72 years and median follow-up was 76 months. Five-year PFS rates were 48% vs. 70% [adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-5.10, P = 0.068] and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 63% vs. 77% (adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.69-4.03, P = 0.254) for VEPEMB compared to ABVD. Overall treatment-related mortality was 4%. World Health Organization grade 4 cardiac and lung toxicity occurred in four patients treated with ABVD versus no cases in the VEPEMB arm. Standard ABVD regimen resulted in better PFS and OS than the VEPEMB, although the differences were not statistically significant. The low toxicity of both treatments was probably attributable to stringent selection of patients based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment that excluded frail patients.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
4197,"Meal replacement in isolated and confined mission environments: Consumption, acceptability, and implications for physical and behavioral health Strategies that reduce food system mass without negatively impacting food intake, acceptability, and resulting astronaut health and performance are essential for mission success in extreme operational environments such as space exploration. Here, we report the impact of substituting the spaceflight standard breakfast with energy equivalent, calorically-dense meal replacement bars (MRBs) on consumption, acceptability, and satiety and on associations with physical and behavioral health outcomes in high-performing subjects completing 30-day missions in the isolated and confined operational environment of NASA's Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) habitat. MRB implementation was associated with reduced daily caloric intake, weight loss, and decrements in mood and neurobehavioral functioning, with no significant impacts on somatic symptoms and physical functioning. Food acceptability ratings suggest that flavor, texture, and menu fatigue attributed to limited variety are contributing factors, which are exacerbated by a daily implementation schedule. Meal replacement strategies for short-duration missions are operationally feasible, moderately acceptable, and can contribute to the practical goal of mass reduction, but more work is needed to define and optimize flavors, variety, and implementation schedules that sustain adequate nutrition, physical and behavioral health, and operational performance over time in isolated, confined, and extreme mission environments.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
4093,"Radiation-induced lung injury on PET/CT: Analysis of FDG uptake response within specific isodose regions of irradiation in non-small cell lung cancer patients Objective: Inflammatory response associated with radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) results in an increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). In this study, we aimed to analyze the degree of FDG uptake within specific isodose regions (IR) of the irradiated lung using standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements, and to correlate posttreatment FDG uptake with radiotherapy (RT) dose parameters, patient characteristics and the imaging time interval after RT completion. Material(s) and Method(s): Data from 30 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent FDG PET/CT imaging at least 12 weeks (72-668 days) after completion of RT were evaluated. In each patient, side-by-side visual registration of the treatment planning CT slices including IR curves with the corresponding PET/CT slices was performed. Using SUV measurements, FDG uptake levels were analyzed within specific IRs of the irradiated lung. The statistical difference between SUVmax of each IR was determined. The RT dose parameters, patient characteristics and time interval between RT and PET/CT were tested for correlation with SUV- max of IRs. Result(s): The mean SUVmax in the IRs of the lung that received 2000-4000cGy was 1.51 +/- 0.66 (mean +/- SD) (min-max: 0.69-2.84), 4000-6000cGy was 2.67 +/- 1.16 (min-max: 0.71-6.0), and >6000Gy was 3.55 +/- 1.09 (min-max: 1.2-5.72). We found statistically significant differences between the SUVmax values of all IRs (SUV2000 vs. SUV4000, p= 0.001; SUV2000 vs.6000, p= 0.002; SUV4000 vs. 6000, p= 0.001). No statistically significant correlation was found between SUVmax and the other variables. Conclusion(s): The findings of this study showed that, although some overlap occurs between IRs, the degree of radiation-related parenchymal FDG uptake gets higher with increasing dose levels. Persistent high FDG uptake levels may be observed in radiation fibrosis areas on PET/CT even several months after RT. © 2011 by Turkiye Klinikleri.",Excluded
4983,"Risk of stomach cancer incidence in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson's regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag. To estimate the baseline risk, sex, attained age, smoking status and alcohol consumption, chronic diseases (peptic ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis) were taken into account. No modifications of the radiogenic risk by non-radiation factors were found in the study worker cohort. No association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was observed.Copyright: © 2020 Zhuntova et al.

4737,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded
3981,"Changes in the redox state and endogenous fluorescence of in vivo human skin due to intrinsic and photo-aging, measured by multiphoton tomography with fluorescence lifetime imaging Ultraviolet radiation from solar exposure is a key extrinsic factor responsible for premature skin aging (i.e., photo-aging). Recent advances using in vivo multiphoton tomography (MPT) demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to assess intrinsic and extrinsic skin aging as an alternative to existing invasive techniques. In this study, we measured changes in epidermal autofluorescence, dermal collagen second harmonic generation (SHG), and the redox state of solar-exposed and solar-protected human skin by MPT with fluorescence lifetime imaging (MPT-FLIM). Twenty-four volunteers across four age categories (20 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, and 50 to 59 years old; six volunteers each) were recruited for MPT-FLIM imaging of the dorsal (solar-exposed; photo-damaged) and volar (solar-protected) forearm. We demonstrate a higher intensity of dermal collagen SHG within the volar forearm compared to dorsal solar-exposed skin. Redox imaging of each epidermal skin stratum by FLIM demonstrates an increase in fluorescence lifetime in the solar-exposed dorsal forearm that is more apparent in aged skin. The results of this study suggest the redox state of the viable epidermis is a key marker in assessing intrinsic and photo-damage skin aging, in combination with changes in autofluorescence and SHG.",Excluded
4358,"Neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based accelerated hyperfractionation chemoradiotherapy for patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma Objective: We report the response to pre-operative gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Method(s): Thirty-five consecutive patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma of UICC Stage II or III with portal vein invasion or tumor abutment of artery received radiotherapy (twice daily fractions of 1.5 Gy, 5 days/week, total dose: 36 Gy; 30 Gy for Phase I Level 1) with weekly intravenous infusions of gemcitabine (400, 600 and 800 mg/m2) at Days 1 and 8 forPhase I and 800 mg/m2 for Phase II. Restaging was repeated after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): Twenty-six of the 35 (74.3%) patients underwent resection. The dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The recommended regimen was total radiation dose of 36 Gy with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2. Surgical resection was conducted in 11 of the 15 (73.3%) patients in Phase I study and 15 of the 20 (75.0%) in Phase II. After recommended dose chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection, the median disease-free survival was 17.4 months (5-year survival rate = 14.3%).

4186,"Infratentorial craniospinal irradiation for von Hippel-Lindau: A retrospective study supporting a new treatment for patients with CNS hemangioblastomas Patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome with diffuse CNS hemangioblastomas have morbidity related to their disease and require a lifetime of surgical resections. Ninety-seven percent of tumors progress, and 5-year surgery rates are 20%-60%. Stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy have had limited success. For the first time, we have used infratentorial craniospinal radiation therapy (ICSRT) for VHL patients with CNS hemangioblastomas. Consecutive VHL patients treated at the National Institutes of Health with radiographic evidence of hemangioblastomas were included if they received ICSRT. Patients underwent neurologic examinations and imaging at 3- to 12-month intervals. Seven patients with 84 hemangioblastomas met eligibility criteria. ICSRT was commonly administered to 43.2 Gy in 24 fractions. Mean pre-ICSRT tumor volume was 5.48 cm3. At a mean follow-up of 73.8 months, mean post-ICSRT tumor volume was 6.87 cm3, and 91 tumors were identified. Complete radiographic resolution was achieved in 17.9% of lesions. Although many patients were no longer optimal surgical candidates, only 4 surgeries were needed for symptomatic lesions after ICSRT, compared with 33 prior. Acute toxicity was mild and no patient developed grade >=1 late spinal cord toxicity according to the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, despite the high dose that the entire spinal cord received. Clinical and radiographic stability or resolution was demonstrated in the majority of tumors. Tumor growth rate in this study was less than reported in natural history studies, and the rate of surgical intervention was reduced. ICSRT was well tolerated, can decrease hemangioblastoma growth rate, and is a potential therapeutic option for VHL patients that warrants further investigation. © 2011 The Author(s).",Excluded
4522,"Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: The significance of radiotherapeutic parameters BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between local recurrence and radiotherapeutic parameters, including dose and RT radiotherapy (RT) field. METHODS. The current study included 35 patients who were diagnosed with immunohistochemically confirmed nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma between 1976 and 2004. There were 21 males and 14 females, and they ranged in age from 18 years to 76 years (median, 51 yrs). The primary tumor originated in the nasal cavity in 28 patients, and 32 patients had Stage I disease. Seventeen patients received treatment solely with RT, and the remaining 18 patients received a combination of chemotherapy and RT. The median tumor dose was 50 grays (Gy) (range, 22-60 Gy). Twenty-seven patients received RT to include all macroscopic lesions, all paranasal sinuses, the palate, and the nasopharynx. Eight patients received RT to all macroscopic lesions with generous margins. RESULTS. A complete remission (CR) or a CR/unconfirmed was achieved in 28 patients (80%). The 5-year overall survival (OAS) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and local control probability (LCP) were 47.3%, 42.9%, and 65.2%, respectively. Patients who received RT only to macroscopic lesions fared less well in terms of LCP (LCP 5 years, 71.9% vs. 41.7%; P = 0.007). The difference in RT field also affected both the OAS rate and the DFS rate. Patients who received RT doses >= 50 Gy tended to achieve favorable local control. CONCLUSIONS. In the management of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, the RT field affected treatment outcomes. RT doses >= 50 Gy resulted in favorable local control. © 2005 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
4633,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of cyclotron-based BNCT with borofalan (10B) for recurrent or locally advanced head and neck cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): In this open-label, phase II JHN002 trial of BNCT using C-BENS with borofalan (10B), patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (R-SCC) or with recurrent/locally advanced non-squamous cell carcinoma (R/LA-nSCC) of the head and neck were intravenously administered 400 mg/kg borofalan (10B), followed by neutron irradiation. The tumor dose was determined passively as the mucosal maximum dose of 12 Gy-Eq. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Post-trial observational JHN002 Look Up study was planned for evaluating locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS). Result(s): Eight R-SCC and 13 R/LA-nSCC patients were enrolled. All R-SCC patients had prior radiotherapy with a median dose of 65.5 Gy (range, 59.4-76.0 Gy). The ORR for all patients was 71%, and complete response/partial response were 50%/25% in R-SCC and 8%/62% in R/LA-nSCC. The 2-year overall survival for R-SCC and R/LA-nSCC were 58% and 100%, respectively. The median LRPFS was 11.5 months for R-SCC. Frequently observed adverse events included alopecia (95%), hyperamylasemia (86%), and nausea (81%).

4380,"Predicting severe acute radiation pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving postoperative radiotherapy: Development and internal validation of a nomogram based on the clinical and dose-volume histogram parameters Background and purpose: Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) can potentially lead to radiation pneumonitis. We aim to develop a nomogram predicting the severe acute radiation pneumonitis (SARP, grade >=3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving PORT. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) factors were collected from 109 patients between 2006 and 2017. The endpoint was the development of SARP within 3 months after PORT. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the prognostic value of each factor in predicting SARP. Nomogram was generated based on multivariate regression coefficients. Area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA) were conducted to validate the model. Result(s): Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that total lung mean dose (tlMD) (OR: 1.003, 95%CI: 1.001-1.006, p = 0.013), percentage of ipsilateral lung volume receiving >=5 Gy (ilV5) (OR: 1.084, 95%CI: 1.020-1.151, p = 0.009), and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) (OR: 4.091, 95%CI: 1.331-12.572, p = 0.014) were independent prognosticators of SARP and were included in the nomogram. ROC curves revealed the AUC of the nomogram was 0.842, which was much higher than any factor alone (tlMD: 0.769; ilV5: 0.744; CCRT: 0.661). Calibration curves showed favorable consistency between the predicted SARP and the actual observation. DCA showed satisfactory positive net benefits of the model among most of the threshold probabilities, indicating great clinical effect. Conclusion(s): We identified that the tlMD (>10.8 Gy), ilV5 (>64.9%), and CCRT could predict SARP among patients with NSCLC receiving PORT. Combining clinical and DVH parameters, a nomogram was first built and validated, showing its potential value in practice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

The images obtained were evaluated for image quality and fracture independently by a radiologist and an emergency medical specialist using a 5-point scale. Result(s): The effective radiation dose calculated for the control group scans was 41.1 +/- 2.1 microSv, whereas the effective radiation dose calculated for the study group scans was 0.5 +/- 0.0 microSv. The effective radiation dose of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01). The CT images in the study group showed no significant differences in the mean image quality score between observer 1 and observer 2 (3.4 and 4.3, respectively; P = 0.58). Both observers could detect all fractures using the ULDCT images. Conclusion(s): ULDCT provides high-quality images in wrist traumas while reducing the radiation dose by approximately 98% compared to SDCT without any changes in diagnostic accuracy.Copyright © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2021.",Excluded
3896,"Phase 2 study of preoperative radiation with concurrent capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab followed by surgery and postoperative 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), and bevacizumab in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer: ECOG 3204 BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of combining oxaliplatin with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitibine and radiation therapy. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival for metastatic disease. We initiated a phase 2 trial to evaluate preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with radiation therapy followed by surgery and postoperative 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab for locally advanced rectal cancer. METHOD(S): Fifty-seven patients with resectable T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Preoperative treatment was capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice daily from Monday to Friday), oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2 weekly), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, 29), and radiation therapy (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed by 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Beginning 8 to 12 weeks after surgery, patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles. RESULT(S): Fifty-four of 57 enrolled patients were eligible. Forty-nine (91%) patients completed preoperative therapy and underwent surgery. Nine patients (17%; 90% confidence interval, 9%-27%) achieved pathologic complete response. Thirty-two patients (59%) experienced pathologic tumor downstaging, and 53% and 15% of patients experienced worst grade 3 and grade 4 acute toxicity, respectively. Forty-seven percent of patients who underwent surgery experienced a surgical complication. CONCLUSION(S): The primary endpoint of a 30% pathologic complete response rate was not reached; however, the majority of patients experienced pathologic downstaging with this regimen. Increased wound-healing delays and complications may have been related to the addition of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, or both. Continued observation of these patients will establish the long-term morbidity and efficacy of this combined modality approach. © 2012 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
4899,"Simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy in esophageal carcinoma: early results of a phase II study PURPOSE: The safety and efficacy of using simultaneous integrated boost intensity-modulated radiotherapy (SIB-IMRT) for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were evaluated in a single-institution phase II setting., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2007 and October 2009, 45 patients underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 27) or radiotherapy alone (n = 18). Two planning target volumes (PTV) were defined for the SIB: PTVC and PTVG, with prescribed doses of 50.4 Gy to the PTVC (1.8 Gy/fraction) and 63 Gy to the PTVG (2.25 Gy/fraction), both given in 28 fractions., RESULTS: At a median follow-up interval of 20.3 months, the 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 42.2 and 40.7 %, respectively. The median overall survival time was 21 months; locoregional control rates were 83.3 % at 1 year and 67.5 % at 3 years. According to CTCAE (version 3.0) criteria, none of the patients developed grade 4-5 toxicity. The most common grade 2 and 3 radiation-related toxicity was radiation esophagitis, occurring in 64 % of all patients (but only 13 % as grade 3). No patient developed grade > 2 pulmonary complications., CONCLUSION: SIB-IMRT is a feasible therapeutic approach for esophageal carcinoma patients and provides encouraging locoregional control with a low toxicity profile. Further investigations should focus on dose escalation and optimization of the combination with systemic therapies.",Excluded
4047,"[Acquisition of age- and sex-dependent patient data for the calculation of annual radiation exposure in nuclear medicine: a German pilot study] AIM: A pilot study for estimation of radiation exposure due to diagnostic procedures in nuclear medicine using routine data of hospitals and practices in Germany., METHODS: Hospitals and practices willing to participate in the study supplied data of one year (1997), containing information on patients' identification number, age, sex, type of diagnostic procedure, radiopharmaceutical, administered activity, type of health insurance (private/public), inpatient/outpatient status, and so-called Leistungsziffer, which describes the type of medical performances in Germany. The effective dose per examination was calculated according to ICRP 80. Mean, standard deviation, median, 5th and 95th percentiles of the effective dose were calculated, stratified by type of organ system and also by sex and age, including patients of > or = 18 years., RESULTS: 82,039 examinations from patients of 9 hospitals and practices were analyzed. The median (5-95(th) percentiles) of the effective dose per examination for all patients was 2.9 mSv (0.4-8.5 mSv); 1.2 examinations per patient and year were performed on average. The three most frequent examinations were bone scans (median 3.4 mSv; 2.9-5.1), thyroid (0.9 mSv; 0.4-2.2) and cardiovascular studies (7.3 mSv; 3.8-20.2). The median effective dose for 18 to 40 years old women was 1.0 mSv (0.4-5.8), for women between 41 and 65 years 2.2 mSv (0.4-7.3) and for women older than 65 years 2.4 mSv (0.5-7.6). The corresponding values for men were 2.6 mSv (0.3-7.6); 3.3 mSv (0.4-9.1), and 3.4 mSv (0.5-8.8)., CONCLUSION: It was possible to gain an accurate determination of radiation exposure of diagnostic procedures in nuclear medicine by routine data.",Excluded
4065,"Survival of patients with metastases of Hurthle cell thyroid carcinom Introduction: It is generally believed that patients with Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma (HCTC) have poor prognosis. Furthermore, distant metastases represent the most frequent cause of thyroid cancer-related death of patients with HCTC. The aim of this study was to report outcomes of patients with distant metastases. Method(s): Altogether 109 patients were treated because of HCTC during the period from 1972 to 2011 in our tertiary center and 33 patients (19 females, 14 males; median age 69 years) had either initially metastatic disease (N=12; 9 females, 3 males; median age 66.5 years) or distant progression of HCTC after initial treatment (N=21; 10 females, 11 males; median age 70 years). Patients with metastases were followed for 1-201 (mean 66, median 41) months. The data on gender and age of the patients, disease history, extent of disease, morphologic characteristics, mode of therapy, outcome, and survival were collected. Statistical correlation between possible prognostic factors and cause-specific survival from time of detection of metastases was analyzed by univariate analysis and log-rank test. Result(s): Single organ and multiple organ metastases were diagnosed in 29 and 4 cases, respectively. The most common were lung metastases, followed by bone, mediastinum, kidney and liver in 26, 8, 2, 2 and 1 case, respectively. Total thyroidectomy, lobectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy and neck dissection were performed in 19, 11, 3 and 7 patients, respectively. Radioiodine (RAI) ablation of thyroid remnant was performed in 28 patients, while 27 patients had RAI therapy (median 2 times). Two or more RAI therapies were applied in 18 patients. Chemotherapy and external irradiation was used in 12 and 19 patients, respectively. Locoregional control of disease was achieved in 18/21 (86%) cases who succumbed due to HCTC. Eleven patients are alive and one lost from follow-up. Median disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ, multiple organ metastases, initially metastatic and metastatic after disease-free interval was 41, 41, 93, 36, 141, 131 and 26 months, respectively. 5-year disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ and multiple organ metastases was 42%, 46%, 57%, 32% and 100%, respectively. 10-year disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ and multiple organ metastases was 28%, 29%, 43%, 25% and 66%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Patients with multiple and initially metastatic HCTC may have long survival after multimodal treatment. Patients with bone metastases live longer than patients with lung metastases.",Excluded
4914,"Biochemical and hematologic values for 18 clinically healthy radiated tortoises (Geochelone radiata) on St Catherines Island, Georgia BACKGROUND: The radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) is a critically endangered species in its native land, the southern portion of the island of Madagascar. Captive breeding programs have generated data on the breeding behavior and ecology of G radiata; however, hematologic and biochemical data also are critically important in managing populations. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex and seasonal effects on hematologic and biochemical data from captive radiated tortoises. METHOD(S): Whole blood was collected in January and August 2001 from 18 radiated tortoises (10 male, 8 female) housed at the Wildlife Survival Center on St Catherines Island, Georgia, as part of a routine health assessment. Routine hematologic and plasma biochemical analyses and electrophoresis were done using standard methods. Data from male and female tortoises were compared within and between seasons using 2-way ANOVA. RESULT(S): RBC and HCT values were significantly higher in summer than in winter and were higher in males than in females. Total protein concentration did not differ significantly between males and females; however, female tortoises had significantly higher concentrations of alpha1- and beta-globulins in winter and summer compared to males. Male tortoises had significantly higher sodium and uric acid concentrations and LDH activity during winter, and higher urea concentration and LDH and CK activities in summer, compared with females. Female tortoises had significantly higher triglyceride and phosphorus concentrations in winter, and higher phosphorus, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations in summer, compared with males. CONCLUSION(S): Sex and seasonal differences in hematologic and biochemical values for radiated tortoises likely reflect vitellogenesis and egg production in females, and altered hydration status and activity in summer. Data from the tortoises in this study will be useful for the seasonal health assessment of this species.",Excluded
4560,"Polarization Variability in Age-related Macular Degeneration SIGNIFICANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Complementary imaging techniques can be used to better characterize and quantify pathological changes associated with AMD. By assessing specific light-tissue interactions, polarization-sensitive imaging can be used to detect tissue disruption early in the disease process., PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare variability in central macular polarization properties in patients with nonexudative AMD and age-matched control subjects., METHODS: A scanning laser polarimeter (GDx, LDT/CZM) was used to acquire 15 x 15-degree macular images in 10 subjects diagnosed with nonexudative AMD and 10 age-matched control subjects. The coefficient of variation (COV, SD/mean) was used to quantify variability in pixel intensity in the central 3.3degree of the macula for custom images emphasizing multiply scattered light (the depolarized light image) and polarization-retaining light (the maximum of the parallel detector image). The intensity COV was compared across subject categories using paired t tests for each image type., RESULTS: The COV in the central macula was significantly higher in the AMD subject group (average, 0.221; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.157 to 0.265) when compared with matched control subjects (average 0.120; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.133) in the depolarized light image (P = .01). The COV in the maximum of the parallel detector image was not statistically different between the two subject groups (AMD average, 0.162 [95% CI, 0.138 to 0.185]; control average, 0.137 [95% CI, 0.115 to 0.158]; P = .21)., CONCLUSIONS: Variability in multiply scattered light is higher than that of light that is more polarization preserving in patients with nonexudative AMD. Multiple scattering may act as an early indicator representing disruption to the macula in early AMD.",Excluded
4367,"Sparing bilateral neck level IB in oropharyngeal carcinoma and xerostomia outcomes OBJECTIVES: To assess whether sparing neck-level IB in target delineation of node-positive (N+) oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) can improve xerostomia outcomes without compromising locoregional control (LRC)., METHODS: A total of 125 N+ OPC patients with a median age of 57 years underwent chemoradiation between May 2010 and December 2011. A total of 74% of patients had T1-T2 disease, 26% T3-T4, 16% N1, 8% N2A, 48% N2B, 28% N2C; 53% base of tongue, 41% tonsil, and 6% other. Patients were divided into those who had target delineation sparing of bilateral level IB (the spared cohort) versus no sparing (the treated cohort). Sparing of contralateral high-level II nodes was also performed more consistently in the spared cohort. A prospective xerostomia questionnaire (patient reported) was given at each patient follow-up visit to this cohort of patients to assess late xerostomia. Clinical assessment (observer rated) at each patient follow-up visit was also recorded., RESULTS: The 2-year LRC for the spared and treated cohorts was 97.5% and 93.8%, respectively (median follow-up, 23.2 mo). No locoregional failures occurred outside of treatment fields. The spared cohort experienced significant benefits in patient-reported xerostomia summary scores (P=0.021) and observer-rated xerostomia scores (P=0.006). In addition, there were significant reductions in mean doses to the ipsilateral submandibular gland (63.9 vs. 70.5 Gy; P<0.001), contralateral submandibular gland (45.0 vs. 56.2 Gy; P<0.001), oral cavity (35.9 vs. 45.2 Gy; P<0.001), and contralateral parotid gland (20.0 vs. 24.4 Gy; P<0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Target delineation sparing of bilateral level IB nodes in N+ OPC reduced mean doses to salivary organs without compromising LRC. Patients with reduced target volumes had better patient-reported xerostomia outcomes.",Excluded
4804,"Associations of LIG4 and HSPB1 genetic polymorphisms with risk of radiation-induced lung injury in lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the correlations of genetic polymorphisms in LIG4 and HSPB1 genes with the radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), especially radiation pneumonitis (RP), in lung cancer patients., METHODS: A total of 160 lung cancer patients, who were diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer and received radiotherapy, were included in the present study from September 2009 to December 2011. TaqMan Real-Time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to verify the SNPs of LIG4 and HSPB1 genes. Chi-square criterion was used to compare the differences in demographic characteristics, exposure to risk factors, and SNPs genotypes. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated by logistic regression analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS 18.0., RESULTS: A total of 32 (20.0%) lung cancer patients had RP after receiving radiotherapy. Of the 32 cases, 4 cases were of grade 2, 24 cases were of grade 3, and 4 cases were of grade 4. However, our results indicated that the general condition and treatment of all patients had no significant difference with RP risk (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, our results revealed that there was no significant association between the frequencies of LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 genotype distribution and the risk of RP (P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we demonstrated that the genetic polymorphisms in LIG4 rs1805388 and HSPB1 rs2868371 were not obviously correlated with the risk of RP and RILI of lung cancer.",Excluded

Method(s): Seventy-eight lesions of brain metastases in 49 lung cancer patients treated by stereotactic radiotherapy between September 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. In the treatment planning, the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as an enhanced lesion plus 3 mm margin. A total dose of 39-42 Gy in three fractions was delivered to the isocenters of the PTV. Result(s): The median survival time after stereotactic radiotherapy was 17.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 61% and 32%, respectively. The presence of extracranial tumors, the pre-treatment performance status, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class were significant prognostic factors. The 1-and 2-year local recurrence rates were 14% and 17%, respectively, with no serious acute toxic effect. Injuries involving brain necrosis were observed in six patients. New brain metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis was seen in more than half of the patients following treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy.

Materials: patients (>= 18 years old) affectedby HGG (III and IV gradeWHO), with a CTV1 (tumor bed +/- residual tumour) < 8 cm were enrolled into this study. Total radiation dose (6940 cGy) was administered using a combination of two different techniques: conformal 3D-RT and FSCRT Radiation dose of 3D-CRT was 5040 cGy if FSCRT boost was concomitant plus sequential or 5940 cGy if only sequential. FSCRT was 1900 cGy if concomitant plus sequential boost or 1000 cGy if only sequential boost. These two different schedules were tailored by CTVI diameter ( 6 em or over 6 em until 8cm). Temozolomide(75 mg/m2 ) wasadministered during the first two or four weeks of radiotherapyrelated to FSCRTmodality. After the end of RTTemozolomide (150-200 mg/m2 ) was administered for at least 6 cycles. Result(s): 43 patients (38 glioblastoma multiforme [GBM] and 5 anaplastic astrocytoma) were enrolled: 27 (63 %) were male and 16 (37%) female. Median age was 53 years (range 25-72yrs). RTOGneurological toxicity GI-2 and G3 were t2% and 3%, respectively. Late neurological toxicity included two cases (4.8 %) of histologically-proven radio-necrosis (at 14 and 24 months).

4735,"Influence of Needle Position on Lumbar Segmental Nerve Root Block Selectivity Background and Objectives: In patients with chronic low back pain radiating to the leg, segmental nerve root blocks (SNRBs) are performed to predict surgical outcome and identify the putative symptomatic spinal nerve. Epidural spread may lead to false interpretation, affecting clinical decision making. Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Method(s): Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). Conclusion(s): The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy. © 2006 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",Excluded

Methods Of 48 consecutively treated patients with neoadjuvant CRT, we selected 20 EAC ypN0 patients (group 1). These patients were matched with 20 pN0 EAC patients who had surgery alone (group 2). Harvested (y)pN0 lymph nodes were examined immunohistochemically (anti-CK8/18 [CAM 5.2]) according to a validated sentinel node protocol. A 3rd group (n = 11) staged as ypN1 after neoadjuvant CRT was used as the control group. Results Upstaging to NMM+ occurred in 2 patients (10%) in group 1 and in 8 patients (40%) in group 2 (P =.028). Disease-free and overall survival rates in NMM+ patients in group 1 were worse compared with NMM- patients (P =.014 and P =.003, respectively) but comparable with ypN1 patients (n = 11). Conclusions A 30% reduction of NMM+ was obtained after neoadjuvant treatment in (y)pN0 patients. NMM+ after CRT had a negative impact on survival in ypN1 patients.

4175,"Phase 1 trial of allogeneic gene-modified tumor cell vaccine RCC-26/CD80/IL-2 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma Preclinical studies showed that the allogeneic tumor cell line RCC-26 displayed natural immunogenic potential that was enhanced through expression of CD80 costimulatory molecules and secretion of interleukin-2. Here we report the study of RCC-26/CD80/IL-2 cells in a phase 1 vaccine trial of renal cell carcinoma patients with metastatic disease (mRCC). Fifteen patients of the HLA-A*0201 allotype, with at least one metastatic lesion, were included. Irradiated vaccine cells were applied in increasing doses of 2.5, 10, and 40x106 cells over 22 weeks. Primary study parameters included safety and toxicity. Sequential blood samples were analyzed by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays to detect tumor antigen-associated (TAA) effector cells. The vaccine was well tolerated and the designated vaccination course was completed in 9 of 15 patients. Neither vaccine-induced autoimmunity nor systemic side effects were observed. Delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions were detected in 11 of 12 evaluated patients and were particularly strong in patients with prolonged survival. In parallel, vaccine-induced immune responses against vaccine or overexpressed TAA were detected in 9 of 12 evaluated patients. No tumor regressions occurred according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria; however, median time to progression was 5.3 months and median survival was 15.6 months, indicating substantial disease stabilization. We conclude that vaccine use was safe and feasible in mRCC. Clinical benefits were limited in these patients with advanced disease; however, immune monitoring revealed vaccine-induced responses against multiple TAAs in the majority of study participants. These results suggest that this vaccine could be useful in combination therapies and/or minimal residual disease. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

In all, 86% of patients received 2 cycles of chemotherapy previously., RESULTS: Five treatment-related deaths occurred: pneumonitis, n = 1; progressive pulmonary fibrosis in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis, n = 2; haemorrhage, n = 2. In all, 8% of patients experienced grade 3 and 1.3% grade 4 pneumonitis; 11% showed late fibrotic alterations grade 2 in lung parenchyma. Clinically relevant acute esophagitis (grade 2 and 3) was seen in 33.3% of patients, 2 patients developed late esophageal stenosis (G3). Patients with upper lobe, middle lobe and central lower lobe tumours (n = 130) were treated with V20 (total lung) up to 50% and patients with peripheral lower lobe tumours (n = 14, basal lateral tumours excluded) up to 42%, without observing acute or late pulmonary toxicity >grade 3. Only patients with basal lateral lower lobe tumours (n = 5) experienced grade 4/5 pulmonary toxicity; V20 for this latter group ranged between 30 and 53%. The mean lung dose was below the QUANTEC recommendation of 20-23 Gy in all patients. The median follow-up time of all patients is 26.3 months (range 2.9-149.4) and of patients alive 80.2 months (range 63.9-149.4.). The median overall survival time of all patients is 26.3 months; the 2-, 5- and 8-year survival rates of 54, 21 and 15%, respectively. The local tumour control rate at 2 and 5 years is 70 and 64%, the regional control rate 90 and 88%, respectively., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Grade 4 or 5 toxicity occurred in 7/150 patients (4.7%), which can be partially avoided in the future (e.g. by excluding patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis). Tolerance and oncologic outcome compare favourably to concomitant chemoradiation also in long-term follow-up.",Excluded
4508,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk., CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy)., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.

4280,"Impact of Radiation Dose Reduction in Abdominal Computed Tomography on Diagnostic Accuracy and Diagnostic Performance in Patients with Suspected Appendicitis: An Intraindividual Comparison RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the intraindividual impact of radiation dose reduction in abdominal computed tomography (CT) on diagnostic performance in patients with suspected appendicitis., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board. Seventy-five patients who underwent standard contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively included. Low-dose CT reconstructions with 75%, 50%, and 25% of the original radiation dose level were generated by applying realistic reduced-dose simulation. Two blinded, independent readers assessed image quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and diagnostic confidence on each dataset. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of appendicitis and complications were calculated for each reader. Paired univariate tests were used to determine intraindividual differences., RESULTS: Among 75 subjects included in the analysis (57% female, mean age: 41 +/- 18 years), the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed appendicitis was 59%. Signal-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality of 50% and 25% reduced-dose CTs were significantly lower than the reference datasets (all P < .005). Appendicitis was correctly identified in all reference and low-dose datasets (sensitivity: 100%, negative predictive value: 100%). Presence of complications was correctly detected in all reference, 75%, and 50% datasets, but was decreased in 25% datasets (sensitivity: 77.8% and negative predictive value: 97.4%). Diagnostic confidence was high for original and 75% datasets, but significantly lower for 50% and 25% datasets (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that diagnostic accuracy in abdominal CT acquisitions acquired at 75% and 50% of radiation dose is maintained in patients with suspected appendicitis, whereas further reduction of radiation exposition is associated with decreased diagnostic performance.

4600,"Effects of 2 different swallowing exercise regimens during organ-preservation therapies for head and neck cancers on swallowing function Background. This study investigated the effects of 2 different swallowing exercise regimens performed during radiation therapy with/without chemotherapy on swallowing function. Methods. Fifty patients were recruited prospectively to 2 groups (the exercise group, n = 26 and the repetitive swallow group, n = 24). Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements were compared at posttreatment and at 3 months. Results. The exercise group eliminated significantly more PEG tubes at 3 months posttreatment compared to the swallow group (16% vs 50%). Among patients who received both radiation and chemotherapy, the exercise group had significantly less PEG tubes immediately posttreat-ment as well as 3 months posttreatment (35% and 10%), compared to the swallow group (69% and 50%). Conclusion. Findings indicate significant benefits of the exercise group's exercise regimen in reducing PEG dependence and oral intake difficulties.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4712,"Human Determinants and the Role of Melanocortin-1 Receptor Variants in Melanoma Risk Independent of UV Radiation Exposure IMPORTANCE: Despite the unquestioned relationship of UV radiation (UVR) exposure and melanoma development, UVR-independent development of melanoma has only recently been described in mice. These findings in mice highlight the importance of the genetic background of the host and could be relevant for preventive measures in humans., OBJECTIVE: To study the role of the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) and melanoma risk independently from UVR in a clinical setting., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Hospital-based case-control study, including genetic testing, questionnaires, and physical data (Molecular Markers of Melanoma Study data set) including 991 melanoma patients (cases) and 800 controls., MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of MC1R variants and melanoma risk independent from sun exposure variables., RESULTS: The 1791 participants included 991 with a diagnosis of melanoma and 800 control patients (mean [SD] age, 59.2 [15.6] years; 50.5% male). Compared with wild-type carriers, carriers of MC1R variants were at higher melanoma risk after statistically adjusting for previous UVR exposure (represented by prior sunburns and signs of actinic skin damage identified by dermatologists), age, and sex compared with wild-type carriers (>=2 variants, OR, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.66-2.75], P < .001; P for trend <.001). After adjustment for sex, age, sunburns in the past, and signs of actinic skin damage, the associations remained significant (OR, 1.65 [95% CI, 1.02-2.67] for R/R, OR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.82-3.81] for R/r; OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.36-2.48] for R/0; and OR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.01-2.21] for r/r, with P values ranging from <.001 to .04 when adjusted for facial actinic skin damage; OR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.62-3.43] for R/r; and OR, 1.47 [95% CI, 1.08-1.99] for R/0 with P values ranging from <.001 to .01 when adjusted for dorsal actinic skin damage; and OR, 2.54 [95% CI, 1.76-3.67] for R/r, OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.30-2.36] for R/0; and OR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.02-2.20] for r/r with P values ranging from <.001 to .04 when adjusted for actinic skin damage on the hands)., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Carriers of MC1R variants were at increased melanoma risk independent of their sun exposure.

4083,"Lower urinary tract function after intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy for invasive bladder cancer BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as a bladder-sparing regimen for invasive bladder cancer is highly promising for selected patients. However, lower urinary tract function after this treatment has not been fully investigated. METHOD(S): The urodynamic effects of intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy were retrospectively evaluated in 14 patients with organ-confined invasive bladder cancer. The post-treatment urodynamic findings were compared with the pretreatment ones (n = 7), and a comparison was made between the serial urodynamic findings after the treatment in another seven patients who were able to undergo the pretreatment urodynamic study (UDS). RESULT(S): The median follow-up period up to the latest UDS was 34 months. Of the 14 patients, the latest UDS revealed some storage dysfunctions in 11 (79%) and some emptying dysfunctions in three (23%). Uninhibited detrusor contraction and decreased bladder compliance were recorded in 29 and 43% at the pretreatment UDS and approximately 50-60 and 20-60% in the serial follow-up studies, respectively (n = 7). Impaired detrusor contractility lasted in one patient. In the seven patients without the pretreatment UDS, decreased maximum cystometric capacity and decreased compliance were recorded in approximately 50-60 and 20-60% at the serial UDS, respectively. Detrusor contractility was aggravated in one patient and completely lost in one with time. CONCLUSION(S): The urodynamic findings indicate that the bladder-sparing regimen might result in perpetuating the lower urinary tract dysfunctions due to invasive bladder cancer itself and/or transurethral surgery and might injure the infrasacral autonomic nerves and the bladder itself.",Excluded
4788,"Religious belief as a coping strategy: An explorative trial in patients irradiated for head-and-neck cancer Purpose: To explore the role of religious belief in coping with disease symptoms and treatment-related side effects in patients with head-and-neck cancer under radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Prospectively collected data were used with a cohort of head-and-neck cancer patients treated by radiotherapy and epoetin beta or placebo within a double-blind multicenter trial. All patients were divided into believers and nonbelievers. Answers to a quality of life questionnaire at four points in time during radiotherapy were analyzed according to both groups. Clinical parameters and therapy side effects were controlled regularly. Result(s): 62.1% of the patients (66/105) sent back a baseline questionnaire discriminating between believers and nonbelievers. For 34.2% (40/105) data of all four measures could be obtained. On average, believers felt better in all categories of side effects at all points of time before, during and directly after therapy. Conclusion(s): Religious faith seems to play an important role in coping strategies of radiotherapy patients. More research in this area would be worthwhile. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
4464,"Chromosomal principle of radiation-induced F1 sterility in Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) A dose-response analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed in male progeny of gamma-irradiated males in the flour moth, Ephestia kuehniella. For comparison, several female progeny from each dose level were examined. Aberrations were detected on microspread preparations of pachytene nuclei in the electron microscope and classified according to pairing configurations of synaptonemal complexes (SCs). Fragmentation and various translocations were the most numerous aberrations, whereas interstitial deletion and inversion were rare. At 100 Gy, relatively simple multiple translocations were found. Multiple translocations showing complicated configurations occurred at 150 and 200 Gy, and their number increased with the dose. In males, the mean number of chromosomal breaks resulting in aberrations linearly increased with the dose from 8.4 to 16.2 per nucleus. In females, this value achieved a maximum of 11.2 breaks/nucleus at 200 Gy. Three factors were suggested to contribute to the reported higher level of F1 sterility in males than females: (i) survival of males with high numbers of breaks, (ii) crossing-over in spermatogenesis but not in the achiasmatic oogenesis, and (iii) a higher impact of induced changes on the fertility of males than females. It was concluded that translocations are most responsible for the production of unbalanced gametes resulting in sterility of F1 moths. However, F1 sterility predicted according to the observed frequency of aberrations was much higher than the actual sterility reported earlier. This suggests a regulation factor which corrects the predicted unbalanced state towards balanced segregation of translocated chromosomes.",Excluded
3877,"Response of the rat spinal cord to X-ray microbeams BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To quantify the late dose-related responses of the rat cervical spinal cord to X-ray irradiations by an array of microbeams or by a single millimeter beam., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Necks of anesthetized rats were irradiated transversely by an 11 mm wide array of 52 parallel, 35 mum wide, vertical X-ray microbeams, separated by 210 mum intervals between centers. Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

4063,"Low-dose simulation and sparse sampling with statistical iterative reconstruction: Dose reduction in MDCT-based bone mineral density and microstructure assessment Introduction: The clinical use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to assess bone strength and fracture risk in subjects with osteoporosis is limited by the relatively high radiation doses of established protocols. In this study, the effects of simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling combined with statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR) on bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and microstructure analyses of trabecular bone were assessed. We also explored whether analyses based on low-dose protocols were still able to differentiate between subjects with and without vertebral fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): In routine chest and abdominal MDCT scans of 12 subjects with prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fractures and 12 controls, pairwise matched for age and sex, lower radiation doses were simulated by virtual lower tube current (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original current) and sparse sampling (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original raw data). All images were reconstructed with SIR. BMD and trabecular bone microstructure parameters (including bone fraction and trabecular thickness) were extracted from the reconstructed images in T10 to L5. Result(s): Effective dose of the original scan was 10 mSv, and 5, 3, and 1 mSv for the 50%, 25%, and 10% sparse sampled/low-dose simulated data, respectively. All BMD measurements calculated from different virtual lower tube currents and different sparse samplings were significantly lower in subjects with fractures compared with controls (range: 89-110 versus 125-187 mg/mL; p < 0.003 for all). Analogously, bone fraction (0.31-0.47 versus 0.50-0.52; p < 0.004 for all) and trabecular thickness were consistently lower in subjects with fractures (1.1-1.3 versus 1.7-2.4 mm; p < 0.011 for all). Conclusion(s): After simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling, BMD and microstructure parameters obtained from MDCT examinations and processed with statistical iterative reconstruction were still significantly different in subjects with and without vertebral fractures, suggesting an osteoporosis diagnosis to be feasible in low-dose protocols.",Excluded
4649,"Minimally invasive or open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as revision surgery for patients previously treated by open discectomy and decompression of the lumbar spine Minimally invasive lumbar fusion techniques have been developed in recent 20 years. The goals of these procedures are to reduce approach-related soft tissue injury, postoperative pain, and disability while allowing the surgery to be conducted in an effective manner. There have been no prospective clinical reports published on the comparison of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as revision surgery for patients previously treated by open discectomy and decompression or a traditional open approach. A prospective clinical study was performed by evaluating the clinical and radiographic results of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as an alternative new technique in the revision surgery for patients previously treated by open procedure. 52 patients (28 M, 24 F) with an average age of 55.7 (31-76) were prospectively evaluated. All patients who had previous discectomy (n = 13), hemilaminectomy (n = 16), laminectomy (n = 12) and facetectomy (n = 11) underwent monosegmental and bisegmental minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MiTLIF) (n = 25) or open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (OTLIF) (n = 27) by two experienced surgeons at one hospital, from March 2006 to October 2008 (minimum 12-month follow-up). The following data were compared between the two groups: the clinical and radiographic results, operative time, blood loss, X-ray exposure time, postoperative back pain, and complications. Clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). The operative time and clinical and radiographic results were basically identical in both groups. Comparing with the OTLIF group, the MiTLIF group had significantly less blood loss and less postoperative back pain at the second day postoperatively. The radiation time was significantly longer in the MiTLIF group. Complications included three cases of small dural tear in the MiTLIF group. There were five cases of dural tear and two cases of superficial wound infection in the OTLIF group. One case of nonunion was observed from each group. Minimally invasive TLIF is a safe and effective procedure for treatment of selected revision patients previously treated by open surgery with some potential advantages. However, this technique needs longer X-ray exposure time. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Excluded
4110,"Radiation Dose Reduction in Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma We queried the National Cancer Data Base for stage I-II Hodgkin lymphoma patients and analyzed radiation dose in patients receiving combined modality therapy (CMT). We found a higher use of 20 Gy as a component of CMT after 2010, the year of publication of the GHSG HD10 trial results., Introduction: Treatment for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) involves radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or combined modality therapy (CMT). We analyzed reduction of RT dose in CMT, particularly in the context of German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 randomized trial results of 2010. Patients and Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with stage I-II HL receiving CMT. RT dose and associated characteristics were analyzed. Stage I and absence of B symptoms were used as a surrogate for early-stage favorable disease. Result(s): Of 31,301 patients with stage I-II HL, 11,457 received CMT between 2004 and 2015. Using the surrogate defined above, 1955 patients (17.1%) were classified as having favorable disease. The majority (61.6%) received 30-36 Gy, while 7.0% received 20 Gy. The provision of 20 Gy was more common in stage I patients (12.3% vs. 5.4% in stage II) and at academic facilities (10.8% vs. 6.3%-8.9% at other facilities). Use of 20 Gy (vs. 30-36 Gy) was less likely with thorax site (odds ratio [OR] 0.43 vs. head and neck), stage II disease (OR 0.41), and B symptoms (OR 0.33). Notably, the use of 20 Gy increased dramatically after 2010 (the year of publication of GHSG HD10 trial results), with rates of 12.3% in 2010-2015 versus 0.1% in 2004-2009 (OR 6.3, P <.001). This was even more pronounced in cases of favorable early-stage disease, with 25.5% after 2010 versus 2.8% before 2010 (OR 13.2, P <.001). The use of doses > 36 Gy decreased over a corresponding time period (OR 0.44, P <.001). Conclusion(s): Analysis of CMT for patients with early-stage HL demonstrates variability in RT dose, including increasing use of 20 Gy and decreasing use of high doses > 36 Gy.Copyright © 2020",Excluded

Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists. In addition, the nationwide representative sample provides unique opportunities compared with previous radiologic technologist studies.",Excluded
4924,"Improved clinical outcome in indolent B-cell lymphoma patients vaccinated with autologous tumor cells experiencing immunogenic death Increasing evidence argues that the success of an anticancer treatment may rely on immunoadjuvant side effects including the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Based on the assumption that this death mechanism is a similar prerequisite for the efficacy of an active immunotherapy using killed tumor cells, we examined a vaccination strategy using dendritic cells (DC) loaded with apoptotic and necrotic cell bodies derived from autologous tumors. Using this approach, clinical and immunologic responses were achieved in 6 of 18 patients with relapsed indolent non - Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The present report illustrates an impaired ability of the neoplastic cells used to vaccinate nonresponders to undergo immunogenic death on exposure to a cell death protocol based on heat shock, gamma-ray, and UVC ray. Interestingly, when compared with doxorubicin, this treatment increased surface translocation of calreticulin and cellular release of high-mobility group box 1 and ATP in histologically distinct NHL cell lines. In contrast, treated lymphoma cells from responders displayed higher amounts of calreticulin and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) compared with those from nonresponders and boosted the production of specific antibodies when loaded into DCs for vaccination. Accordingly, the extent of calreticulin and HSP90 surface expression in the DC antigenic cargo was significantly associated with the clinical and immunologic responses achieved. Our results indicate that a positive clinical effect is obtained when immunogenically killed autologous neoplastic cells are used for the generation of a DC-based vaccine. Therapeutic improvements may thus be accomplished by circumventing the tumor-impaired ability to undergo immunogenic death and prime the antitumor immune response. ©2010 AACR.",Excluded
4158,"Multifaceted applications of pre-mature chromosome condensation in radiation biodosimetry Background: Biodosimetry with persistent cytogenetic indicators in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) plays crucial role in regulatory/medical management of individuals overexposed to radiation. Conventional methods require ~48 h culture and have limited dose range (0.1-5Gy) applications due to checkpoint arrest/poor stimulation. G0-Phase Premature chromosome condensation (G0-PCC) allows chromosome aberration analysis within hours after blood collection. Due to high skill demand, applications of G0-PCC were not very well explored and being re-visited worldwide. Among all aberrations, analysis of excess chromosomal fragments is quickest. Radiation dose response curve for the fragments has been reported. Purpose(s): In present study, excess fragment analysis has been addressed in detail, in addition to validation of radiation dose response curve, gender variation in the response, dose dependent repair kinetics, minimum detection limit (MDL), duration and accuracy of final dose estimation with 5blindfolded, ex vivo irradiated samples have been studied. In extension, feasibility of multiparametric dosimetry with Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based endpoints were qualitatively explored. Material(s) and Method(s): PBLs were exposed to Gamma-Radiation and G0-PCC was performed at different time points. Decay kinetics and dose response curve were established. Gender Variation of the frequency of the fragments was assessed at 0, 2 and 4 Gy. FISH was performed with G0-PCC applying centromere probe, whole chromosome paints, multi-color FISH and multi-color banding probes. Result(s): Radiation response curve for fragments was found to be linear (Slope 1.09 +/- 0.031 Gy-1). Background frequency as well as dose response did not show significant gender bias. Based on variation in background frequency of fragments MDL was calculated to be ~0.3 Gy. Kinetics of fragment tested at 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h showed exponential decay pattern from 0 to 8 h and without further decay. Final dose estimation of five samples was completed within 13 man-hours. Dicentric chromosomes, translocations, insertions and breaks were identifiable in combination with centromere FISH and WCP. Advanced methods employing multicolor FISH and multi-color banding were also demonstrated with PCC spreads. Conclusion(s): G0-PCC, can be useful tool for high dose biodosimetry with quick assessment of fragment frequency. Further, it holds potential for multi-parametric dosimetry in combination with FISH.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Included

Methods and Materials 118 patients underwent PET/CT TP during June 2007 to May 2009. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured on CT-only and PET/CT studies by radiation oncologists (ROs) and nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) for 95 patients with positive PET scans. Treatment plans and dose-volume histograms were generated for CT-only and PET/CT for 95 evaluable sites. Paired t test statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results 70 (74%) patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10 (11%) had Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 (10%) had plasma-cell neoplasm, and 3 (3%) had other hematologic malignancies. Forty-three (45%) presented with relapsed/refractory disease. Forty-five (47%) received no prior chemotherapy. The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by ROs in 38 patients (median, 27%; range, 5%-70%) and decreased GTV in 41 (median, 39.5%; range, 5%-80%). The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by NMPs in 27 patients (median, 26.5%; range, 5%-95%) and decreased GTV in 52 (median, 70%; range, 5%-99%). The intraobserver correlation between CT-GTV and PET-GTV was higher for ROs than for NMPs (0.94, P<.01 vs 0.89, P<.01). On the basis of Bland-Altman plots, the PET-GTVs defined by ROs were larger than those defined by NMPs. On evaluation of clinical TPs, only 4 (4%) patients had inadequate target coverage (D95 <95%) of the PET-GTV defined by NMPs. Conclusions Significant differences between the RO and NMP volumes were identified when PET was coregistered to CT for radiation planning. Despite this, the PET-GTV defined by ROs and NMPs received acceptable prescription dose in nearly all patients. However, given the potential for a marginal miss, consultation with an experienced PET reader is highly encouraged when PET/CT volumes are delineated, particularly for questionable lesions and to assure complete and accurate target volume coverage. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Blood flow parameters 1 cm below the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (mean velocity time averaged, lumen diameter, resistivity index-RI) as well as perivascular reaction, were recorded on Color Doppler Imaging video tapes in a series of five consecutive examinations up to six months postirradiation. There were no statistically significant changes shown between the initial and follow-up examinations for any of the parameters investigated. There was no difference in blood flow between the ipsilateral (operated-irradiated) and contralateral side of the neck. Results did not seem to correlate with known vascular disease risk factors such as sex, arterial pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking and diabetes. After the effect of age was controlled, flow measurements remained statistically stable. Radiation dosage did not appear to influence carotid flow parameters. Perivascular reaction had the highest peak immediately postirradiation but regressed with time. This study suggests that therapeutic radiation of the neck at this dose level may not have important effects on the maxillofacial region blood supply for approximately eight months postoperatively; however, these patients should be closely evaluated for symptoms or signs of carotid artery lesions on a long-term basis.",Excluded
4648,"Utilization of stem cells in alginate for nucleus pulposus tissue engineering In a general view of anatomy, intervertebral disc is composed of three parts: annulus fibrosus (AF), nucleus pulposus (NP), and cartilage endplate (CEP). Recently, several types of stem cells were successfully isolated from these corresponding regions, but up to now, no research was performed about which kind of stem cells is the most efficient candidate for NP tissue engineering or for stem cell-based disc regeneration therapy. In this study, we compared the regenerative potentials of the above-mentioned three kinds of disc-derived stem cells with that of the classic bone marrow (BM)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a rabbit disc degeneration model. By magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray, histology, etc. evaluations, we found that cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) showed superior capacity compared with the annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs), nucleus pulposus-derived stem cells (NPSCs), and BM-MSCs (p<0.05); additionally, when comparing the CESC group with the normal control group, there existed no statistical difference in X-ray (p>0.05). Those results demonstrated that the CESC-seeded alginate construct performed the most powerful ability for NP regeneration, while AFSCs showed the most inferior potency, NPSCs and BM-MSCs had similar regenerative capacity and located in the middle. All in all, our study showed that CESCs might act as an efficient seed cell source for NP tissue engineering, which paved a new way for the biological solution of disc degeneration diseases. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",Excluded
4428,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included
4386,"High-energy photon and electron beam The optimum radiation treatment plan for any given clinical situation can be achieved by combining various irradiation modalities and beam energies. The availability of equipment that provides photon and electron beams of energies from 4 MeV to 25 MeV permits optimal dose distribution throughout the treatment volume. Since no difference in the biological effectiveness of electrons compared with megavoltage photons has been demonstrated in laboratory studies, there is no hesitation in combining electrons with photons. The selection of the various energies, the combination of electrons with photons, and the ratio of the given doses of each beam depend on the location of the tumor and the maximum depth to be treated. With the use of one beam alone, a combination of 25 MeV and 4 to 6 MeV photon beams, or a combination of photons and electrons, the most effective treatment plan with the available beams can be designed for any clinical situation.",Excluded
4675,"The role of autophagy regulator LC3B in thyroid cancer cells response to metabolic stress and radiation Decreased expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), a well-characterized regulator of autophagy, has been shown to be associated with metastatic progression in patients with thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs.

4118,"Can Radiation Dose Burden of CT Angiography be Reduced While Still Accurately Diagnosing Etiology of Acute Chest Pain? Background: Multidetector-row computed tomography is often used as a first-line test in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases including aortic dissection, coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism. This study evaluated the impact of reducing the tube potential from 120 kVp to 100 kVp in a selected group of patients presenting to the Emergency Room with acute chest pain. The primary end point was how the reduction of radiation dose affected image quality. Method(s): The current study was performed over a period of 2 years between July, 2016 and July, 2018. This study included patients who presented to the Emergency Room or to an outpatient clinic and were suspected to have a coronary, a pulmonary (pulmonary embolism), or an aortic (aortic dissection) etiology. Suspicion was determined by the medical provider based on clinical picture, EKG, and lab results when available. All patients were referred for computed tomography angiography (CTA) testing as part of their diagnostic evaluation. A total of 84 patients were involved in the study. Seventy of the patients underwent the low acquisition Kvp technique (100 Kvp - Group I). In the remaining 14 patients, the standard acquisition technique (120-140 Kvp - Group II) was utilized. Result(s): This study showed the feasibility of using low energy CTA to significantly reduce the patient's radiation exposure without markedly affecting the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion(s): The use of low energy CTA protocols in cases of acute chest pain revealed no major difference regarding the image quality with marked reduction of the radiation dose received by the patient.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3942,"Reduction of healthcare-associated infections in a long-term care brain injury ward by replacing regular linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens Background: Contaminated textiles in hospitals contribute to endogenous, indirect-contact, and aerosol transmission of nosocomial related pathogens. Copper oxide impregnated linens have wide-spectrum antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Our aim was to determine if replacing non-biocidal linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens would reduce the rates of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in a long-term care ward. Method(s): We compared the rates of HAI in two analogous patient cohorts in a head injury care ward over two 6-month parallel periods before (period A) and after (period B) replacing all the regular non-biocidal linens and personnel uniforms with copper oxide impregnated biocidal products. Result(s): During period B, in comparison to period A, there was a 24% reduction in the HAI per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.05), a 47% reduction in the number of fever days (>38.5. degreeC) per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.01), and a 32.8% reduction in total number of days of antibiotic administration per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.0001). Accordingly there was saving of approximately 27% in costs of antibiotics, HAI-related treatments, X-rays, disposables, labor, and laundry, expenses during period B.

4124,"Noonan syndrome and glioneuronal tumors: A central nervous system cancer predisposition association? BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS) is associated with germline Ras signaling pathway mutations, RAS overactivation and increased tumorigenesis risk. Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors (RFGT) are rare indolent tumors. We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT. PATIENT 1: A 22-year-old male with NS was diagnosed with RFGT after partial tumor resection followed by focal irradiation. He was enrolled on a comprehensive genomic profiling study involving paired tumor-normal whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of the disease-involved tissue, revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Gly60Ala) consistent with NS, and a somatic deletion (p.Ile442-Thr454del) in PIK3R1 and a somatic variant (p.Lys656Glu) in FGFR1 with concomitant increased expression of PIK3R1 and FGFR1 by RNA-sequencing. The patient remains without tumor progression now nine months since irradiation. PATIENT 2: A 19-year-old male with persistent headaches, underwent a brain MRI demonstrated multiple abnormal signals in the pineal region and midbrain. He had a stereotactic biopsy revealing RFGT. He was enrolled on the genomic study revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Asn308Asp) resulting in a new diagnosis of NS. Several family members were subsequently identified with clinical features of NS, including his mother and two siblings, enabling appropriate counseling. Two somatic variants were found in trans in PIK3R1 (p.Thr454-Phe456del and p.Glu451-Asn453delinsAsp), and a somatic variant (p.Val695Met) in FGFR1, with resultant overexpression of PIK3R1. The patient is monitored with surveillance imaging. CONCLUSION(S): We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT; strongly suggesting their connection to RASopathies through the overactivation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.",Excluded
4079,"Radiation Dose-Dependent Hippocampal Atrophy Detected With Longitudinal Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging PURPOSE: After radiation therapy (RT) to the brain, patients often experience memory impairment, which may be partially mediated by damage to the hippocampus. Hippocampal sparing in RT planning is the subject of recent and ongoing clinical trials. Calculating appropriate hippocampal dose constraints would be improved by efficient in vivo measurements of hippocampal damage. In this study we sought to determine whether brain RT was associated with dose-dependent hippocampal atrophy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hippocampal volume was measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 52 patients who underwent fractionated, partial brain RT for primary brain tumors. Study patients had high-resolution, 3-dimensional volumetric MRI before and 1 year after RT. Images were processed using software with clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration and Conformite Europeene marking for automated measurement of hippocampal volume. Automated results were inspected visually for accuracy. Tumor and surgical changes were censored. Mean hippocampal dose was tested for correlation with hippocampal atrophy 1 year after RT. Average hippocampal volume change was also calculated for hippocampi receiving high (>40 Gy) or low (<10 Gy) mean RT dose. A multivariate analysis was conducted with linear mixed-effects modeling to evaluate other potential predictors of hippocampal volume change, including patient (random effect), age, hemisphere, sex, seizure history, and baseline volume. Statistical significance was evaluated at alpha = 0.05., RESULTS: Mean hippocampal dose was significantly correlated with hippocampal volume loss (r=-0.24, P=.03). Mean hippocampal volume was significantly reduced 1 year after high-dose RT (mean -6%, P=.009) but not after low-dose RT. In multivariate analysis, both RT dose and patient age were significant predictors of hippocampal atrophy (P<.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The hippocampus demonstrates radiation dose-dependent atrophy after treatment for brain tumors. Quantitative MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique capable of measuring radiation effects on intracranial structures. This technique could be investigated as a potential biomarker for development of reliable dose constraints for improved cognitive outcomes. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

4069,"Indications of future decreasing trends in skin-melanoma mortality among whites in the United States Trends in skin melanoma death rates during a 35-year period, 1950-84, were analyzed according to age, sex, and birth cohort for whites in the United States. In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described. These results indicate that baseline data necessary for assessing the potential effects on this disease from future depletions of the ozone layer, and predicted increases of solar ultra-violet radiation exposure, would be improved with the inclusion of cohort data and age-specific trend analyses.",Excluded
4381,"Evaluation of gait speed after applying kinesio tape on quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee osteoarthritis BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease, known as the most common cause of difficulty walking in older adults and subsequently is associated with slow walking. Functional decline, increased risk of falls and the presence of pain are, in many studies, related to the muscle weakness caused by osteoarthritis especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles. Many studies have shown that the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle can affect gait, by improving or weakening it. Kinesio Tape is a physiotherapeutic technique, which reduces pain and increases muscular strength by irritating the skin receptors. AIM: This study aimed to verify if the application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle increases gait speed while decreasing the time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test in patients with knee osteoarthritis and also in subjects without knee osteoarthritis. METHOD(S): In this study, we observed the change of gait speed with the help of the 10-meter walk test before, one day and three days after the application of Kinesio Tape in quadriceps femoris muscle. We compared the results of the time needed to perform the 10-meter walk in two groups. In the first group, the Patients group, participated 102 out-patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis, while in the second group, the Control group, participated 73 subjects with a main excluding criterion a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis. RESULT(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease of time needed to perform the 10-meter walk test in both groups three days after application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle. However, there was not a significant change one day after the application of Kinesio Tape compared before its application in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease in time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test. Kinesio Tape is a technique that can be used especially when changing walking stereotypes is a long-term goal of the treatment.Copyright © 2018 Klejda Tani, Irena Kola, Vjollca Shpata, Fregen Dhamaj.

3946,"Biological effects of low-dose chest CT on chromosomal DNA Background: Although the National Lung Screening Trial reported a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality when low-dose (LD) CT chest examinations are used for a diagnosis, their biologic effects from radiation exposure remain unclear. Purpose(s): To compare LD CT and standard-dose (SD) CT for DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2016 and June 2018, 209 participants who were referred to a respiratory surgery department for chest CT studies were prospectively enrolled in this study. Individuals were excluded if they had undergone radiography examinations within the last 3 days or had undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and 15 minutes after CT. The number of g-H2AX foci and unstable CAs in lymphocytes was quantified by immunofluorescent staining of g-H2AX and by fluorescence in situ hybridization by using peptide nucleic acid probes for centromeres and telomeres, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. Result(s): Of the 209 participants (105 women, 104 men; mean age, 67.0 years 6 11.3 [standard deviation]), 107 underwent chest LD CT and 102 underwent chest SD CT. Sex distribution, age, and body size metrics were similar between the two groups. The median effective dose of LD CT and SD CT was 1.5 and 5.0 mSv, respectively. The number of double-strand breaks and CAs increased after a SD CT examination (g-H2AX, P , .001; CAs, P = .003); the number of double-strand breaks and CAs before and after LD CT was not different (g-H2AX, P = .45; CAs, P = .69).

Method(s): Time-lag performance of RFA after ethanol injection (Time-lag PEI-RFA) was performed in all cases. The volume of coagulated necrosis and the applied energy for total and per unit volume coagulated necrosis were examined in the groups treated under general (group G) or local anesthesia (group L). Result(s): The results showed that the total applied energy and the applied energy per unit volume of whole and marginal, coagulated necrosis were significantly larger in group G than those in the group L, resulting in a larger volume of coagulated necrosis in the group G. The rate of local tumor recurrence within one year was extremely low in group G. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that EI-RFA, under general anesthesia, may be effective for the treatment of HCC because a larger quantity of ethanol and energy could be applied during treatment under pain-free condition for the patients. © 2008 WJG.

Light and transmission electron microscopy were performed on six corneal specimens., RESULTS: Clinical criteria for the diagnosis included a central, horizontally oval, corneal stromal haze with a ground glass appearance, a uniform or lamellar pattern, greater extent anteriorly and involvement of 50% to 100% of stromal thickness. It occurred bilaterally but sometimes asymmetrically. Density varied from mild to moderate and seldom decreased visual acuity. Sixteen (28%) of 58 corneas had additional degenerative lesions (spheroidal degeneration, mild calcific band keratopathy, and Salzmann's nodular degeneration). Refractile stromal lines or posterior white dots were present in six (10%) of 58 eyes. Videokeratography in 11 (29%) of 38 eyes demonstrated flat areas that overlay the stromal haze. Pathologic analysis demonstrated focal intracellular and extracellular deposits of excess proteoglycans. One specimen showed amyloid. We postulate that climatic factors play a pathogenic role because the disorder occurs in individuals who were exposed to the sunny, dry, dusty environment of the Middle East and because other corneal degenerative disorders were present concomitantly., CONCLUSIONS: Climatic proteoglycan stromal keratopathy is a corneal degeneration that appears as an oval, central, gray, ground-glass haze associated with central corneal flattening on videokeratography and as excess proteoglycans on histologic examination.

Purpose: In reported retrospective non-randomized trials of treatment of esophageal carcinoma, blacks have a lower survival from esophageal cancer than whites. None of these studies has accounted for the extent of disease, or the methods and quality of treatment. We reviewed the data that included only patients treated on the chemoradiation arm of the RTOG-8501 esophageal carcinoma trial to see if there were differences in overall survival between black and white patients receiving the same standard of care. Methods and Materials: One hundred-nineteen patients, 37 blacks and 82 whites were evaluated who met the criteria for receiving chemoradiation of 5000 cGy and four courses of Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and Fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 for 4 days). Result(s): Blacks had squamous histology only, with 86% of blacks having weight loss of 10 lbs. or more compared to 56% of whites (p = 0.001). In addition, blacks had larger tumors and more difficulty eating (p = 0.010). Overall, there was no difference in the Kaplan-Meier median survival estimate by race (p = 0.2757). Only when we limited the analysis to the 'squamous histology' subgroup, stratified according to age >70 vs. <70 years (p = 0.0002), and nodal status (p = 0.0177) in a Cox regression model analysis, did race appear to be a significant factor (p = 0.0012). However, using the entire database, the age effect was found to be a 'bimodal' effect, wherein the 'youngest' ( 70 years) did poorly. Because of the dramatic differences in the age and histology distributions between blacks and whites, this issue could not be resolved in the subset of squamous only who received chemoradiation. Conclusion(s): The increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma among white patients without a corresponding increase of this histology in blacks reflects a difference in diet and or lifestyle compared to blacks that deserves additional study. When treated aggressively with chemoradiation, race did not appear to be a statistically significant factor for overall survival.",Excluded
4348,"Regional correlation between estimated UVB levels and skin cancer mortality in Japan Most ecological studies investigating the relationship between incidence and/or mortality of skin cancer and surrogate measures of ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) have been conducted among the Caucasian population.

The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for malignant melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of the skin was calculated by sex, region and time-period for all deaths occurring in the period 1973-1994. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was calculated between estimated ambient UVB and regional SMRs for the two types of skin cancer. There was no geographical correlation between UVB and skin cancer mortality, except for a significantly negative correlation in malignant melanoma among males and a significantly negative correlation in other malignant neoplasms of the skin confined to unexposed anatomic sites of the body among females. The characteristic ecological relationship adds to the importance of conducting further epidemiological studies at the individual level in Japan.",Excluded

In addition, the application of a modality that can control the temperature inside the joints has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of percutaneous radiofrequency hyperthermia, which could safely raise the temperature of the body core, in patients with OA knees., METHODS: Temperature changes inside the knee joint without OA were measured during exposure to radiofrequency. Radiofrequency hyperthermia was performed on 12 OA knees by exposure to 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min, 3 times, at 1-week intervals. The clinical outcome was evaluated by use of the Lequesne index (LI) and the Japan Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale. The osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) responder criteria were also analyzed., RESULTS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia of 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min increased the temperature inside the joint from 34.4 to 39.4degreeC.

4796,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

4949,"TWO FACTORS INFLUENCING DOSE RECONSTRUCTION IN LOW DOSE RANGE: THE VARIABILITY OF BKG INTENSITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WATER CONTENT A fast and accurate retrospective dosimetry method for the triage is very important in radiation accidents. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) fingernail dosimetry is a promising way to estimate radiation dose. This article presents two factors influencing dose reconstruction in low dose range: the variability of background signal (BKG) intensity on one individual and water content. Comparing the EPR spectrum of dried and humidified fingernail samples, it is necessary to add a procedure of dehydration before EPR measurements, so as to eliminate the deviation caused by water content. Besides, the BKGs of different fingers' nails are not the same as researchers thought previously, and the difference between maximum and minimum BKG intensities of one individual can reach 55.89 %. Meanwhile, the variability of the BKG intensity among individuals is large enough to impact precise dose reconstruction. Water within fingernails and instability of BKG are two reasons that cause the inaccuracy of radiation dose reconstruction in low-dosage level.Copyright © The Author 2015.

Success in relating mutant frequencies to exposure to high levels of mutagens has encouraged researchers to examine the effects of lower doses, such as those found among workers exposed at their jobs. In order to relate low doses of mutagens to biological effects, accurate characterization of exposure is critical, but most occupational studies are forced to use gross measures of exposure derived from job title or professional judgments as to potential exposure. Mutant frequencies and other relevant lymphocyte characteristics of 58 industrial workers were related to exposure status in two ways. When workers were classed as ""exposed"" or ""unexposed"" to ionizing radiation, no difference in any biological variable was seen between the two groups. When dosimeter readings were used as the exposure indicator, significant relationships appeared between dose and mutant frequency and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte subpopulation ratios. Mutant frequency was also positively related to age and smoking status. The time course of exposure and of appearance of mutant cells is discussed and it is suggested that this relationship receive attention in occupational studies of genotoxic effects.",Excluded

We evaluated the relationship between heart dose parameters and sST-2 changes in chest malignant tumor patients who received chest radiation. Method(s): We prospectively collected thoracic malignancy cancer patients who had received chest radiotherapy. Heart dosimetry parameters were extracted from the treatment planning system. sST-2 was measured at baseline, the middle stage, and after radiotherapy (recorded as pre-ST-2, mid-ST-2, and post-ST-2). sST-2 change rate was calculated. Scatter plots showed the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Multiple regression was used to analyze the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Result(s): Totally, 60 patients were enrolled.

3882,"DNA damage and repair of head and neck cancer cells after radio- and chemotherapy DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included

The median follow-up period was 5.6 years. Result(s): Only 1 patient experienced local recurrence, 19 developed regional recurrence, and 12 distant recurrence. The recurrence-free survival rate at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82.0%, 68.5%, and 65.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rate after surgery and IORT was 88.4%, 66.1%, and 56.2%, respectively. No perioperative fatalities occurred. Complications developed in 26 patients and included vascular complications in 7, trismus in 6, fistulas in 4, radiation osteonecrosis in 4, flap necrosis in 2, wound dehiscence in 2, and neuropathy in 1. Of these 26 patients, 12 had recurrent disease, and 8 had undergone external beam radiotherapy before IORT. Conclusion(s): IORT results in effective local disease control at acceptable levels of toxicity and should be considered for patients with primary or recurrent cancer of the parotid gland. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4276,"Combined FET PET/MRI radiomics differentiates radiation injury from recurrent brain metastasis Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined textural feature analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and static O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation between local recurrent brain metastasis and radiation injury since CE-MRI often remains inconclusive. Method(s): Fifty-two patients with new or progressive contrast-enhancing brain lesions on MRI after radiotherapy (predominantly stereotactic radiosurgery) of brain metastases were additionally investigated using FET PET. Based on histology (n = 19) or clinicoradiological follow-up (n = 33), local recurrent brain metastases were diagnosed in 21 patients (40%) and radiation injury in 31 patients (60%). Forty-two textural features were calculated on both unfiltered and filtered CE-MRI and summed FET PET images (20-40 min p.i.), using the software LIFEx. After feature selection, logistic regression models using a maximum of five features to avoid overfitting were calculated for each imaging modality separately and for the combined FET PET/MRI features. The resulting models were validated using cross-validation. Diagnostic accuracies were calculated for each imaging modality separately as well as for the combined model. Result(s): For the differentiation between radiation injury and recurrence of brain metastasis, textural features extracted from CE-MRI had a diagnostic accuracy of 81% (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 90%). FET PET textural features revealed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy of 83% (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 75%). However, the highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained when combining CE-MRI and FET PET features (accuracy, 89%; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 96%). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that combined FET PET/CE-MRI radiomics using textural feature analysis offers a great potential to contribute significantly to the management of patients with brain metastases.Copyright © 2018 The Authors",Excluded
4404,"Normal Tissue Complication Probability Modeling of Pulmonary Toxicity After Stereotactic and Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Central Lung Tumors Purpose: To evaluate clinical pulmonary and radiographic bronchial toxicity after stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and hypofractionated radiation therapy for central lung tumors, and perform normal tissue complication probability modeling and multivariable analyses to identify predictors for toxicity. Methods and Materials: A pooled analysis was performed of patients with a central lung tumor treated using <=12 fractions at 2 centers between 2006 and 2015. Airways were manually contoured on planning computed tomography scans, and doses were recalculated to an equivalent dose of 2 Gy per fraction with an alpha/beta ratio of 3. Grade >=3 (>=G3) clinical pulmonary toxicity was evaluated by 2 or more physicians. Radiographic toxicity was defined as a stenosis or an occlusion with or without atelectasis using follow-up computed tomography scans. Logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analyses. Result(s): A total of 585 bronchial structures were studied in 195 patients who were mainly treated using 5 or 8 fractions (60%). Median patient survival was 27.9 months (95% confidence interval 22.3-33.6 months). Clinical >=G3 toxicity was observed in 24 patients (12%) and radiographic bronchial toxicity in 55 patients (28%), both mainly manifesting <=12 months after treatment. All analyzed dosimetric parameters correlated with clinical and lobar bronchial radiographic toxicity, with V130Gy,EQD having the highest odds ratio. Normal tissue complication probability modeling showed a volume dependency for the development of both clinical and radiographic toxicity. On multivariate analyses, significant predictors for >=G3 toxicity were a planning target volume overlapping the trachea or main stem bronchus (P =.005), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.034), and the total V130Gy,EQD (P =.012). Radiographic bronchial toxicity did not significantly correlate with clinical toxicity (P =.663). Conclusion(s): We identified patient and dosimetric factors associated with clinical and radiographic toxicity after high-dose radiation therapy for central lung tumors. Additional data from prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4943,"Relation between clinical mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood and their spatial label free scattering patterns A single living cell's light scattering pattern (LSP) in the horizontal plane, which has been denoted as the cell's ""2D fingerprint,"" may provide a powerful label-free detection tool in clinical applications. We have recently studied the LSP in spatial scattering planes, denoted as the cell's ""3D fingerprint,"" for mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood. The effects of membrane size, morphology, and the existence of the nucleus on the spatial LSP are discussed. In order to distinguish clinical label-free mature and immature lymphocytes, the special features of the spatial LSP are studied by statistical method in both the spatial and frequency domains. Spatial LSP provides rich information on the cell's morphology and contents, which can distinguish mature from immature lymphocyte cells and hence ultimately it may be a useful label-free technique for clinical leukemia diagnosis.",Excluded
4147,"The origin of Europeans is not rooted in the Middle East but in Southern East Asia The study of tooth crown variables has proven useful in the assessment of human origin and dispersal. I show that multivariate analysis of quantified total tooth structure from dental X-rays is a powerful phylogenetic methodology. From an analysis of the complex global dental phenotype ('GDP,' composed of ~ 30 root, pulp, crown, and enamel variables per tooth), a representative Western European population was found to associate with Southeast Asians, while Mongolians formed a tight cluster with all Native Americans. The results suggest that either an emigrant wave, or waves, of modern humans emerged from Africa and with time segregated into at least three groups: Australian aborigines, Europeans, and Southeast Asians, or less likely due to genetic and archaeologic observations, a southern Asia origin of all modem humans from an emigrant African hominid. Both hypotheses portend an early evolution of the European genotype and support the argument that Europeans are principally derived from Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and thus Middle East Neolithic people did not have a major genetic impact on Europeans.",Excluded
4157,"Effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography to assess patency in gastrointestinal tracts with a patency capsule BACKGROUND/AIMS: A patency capsule (PC) is used to safely perform capsule endoscopy. When the PC is not excreted within the defined time frame, radiography often cannot localize the PC. Computed tomography (CT) localizes a PC more definitively than radiography. We evaluated the localization of PCs using low-dose (LD)-CT., METHODOLOGY: Forty-nine patients received a PC and 33 did not excrete the PC within the defined time frame and underwent radiography and LDCT with a 90% exposure reduction., RESULTS: LDCT localized the PC in 31 patients (93.9%), whereas radiography localized it in 7 (21.2%), indicating a significantly higher detection rate with LDCT (P<0.0001). PC retention in the small intestine was confirmed by LDCT in 4 patients. Retention was not observed during capsule endoscopy in the patients with confirmed patency of the gastrointestinal tract. In 21 patients who underwent LDCT with the conventional photographing area, the effective radiographic exposure dose associated with LDCT was 1.43+/-1.08 mSv. Conversely, in the 12 patients who underwent LDCT with a reduced photographing area, the effective dose was reduced to 0.62+/-0.27 mSv (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: LDCT with a reduced exposure dose can definitively localize a PC. Therefore, this method may allow capsule endoscopy to be performed for more diseases.",Excluded
4364,"FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of presacral soft tissue in restaging of rectal cancer patients Objective: Presacral soft tissue is often seen on diagnostic follow-up CT after primary surgical treatment of rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of FDG PET/CT and diagnostic CT in the evaluation of presacral soft tissue in restaging rectal cancer patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-eight patients (age range, 36-73 years; men and women) with rectal cancer after primary treatment underwent FDG PET/CT for evaluation of presacral soft tissue detected on diagnostic contrast CT. CT was performed for restaging of suspected recurrence based on clinical findings and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). PET findings were correlated with CEA levels and biopsy findings. PET was considered positive if there was abnormal presacral soft-tissue uptake greater than surrounding activity. Result(s): Of the 68 patients, 42 were PET-positive and 26 were negative. Of the 42 PET-positive patients, 27 had biopsy-proven recurrent cancer, CEA was elevated in 26 patients and normal in one patient. CEA was normal in 12 of 15 patients with positive PET and negative biopsy. Among the 26 PET-negative patient, CEA was normal in 14, without disease elsewhere. CEA was elevated in 12 patients with negative PET (three had inflammation on biopsy, one mucinous adenocarcinoma, and eight had malignancy at extrapelvic sites. Conclusion(s): FDG PET/CT and CEA are complementary in follow-up of presacral soft tissue in rectal cancer restaging. Abnormal presacral FDG uptake with elevated CEA indicates presacral recurrence, whereas positive PET with normal CEA does not usually indicate recurrence. Negative PET with normal CEA can be considered benign avoiding the need for biopsy.",Excluded
4218,"Triiodothyronine increases calcium loss in a bed rest antigravity model for space flight Bed rest has been used as a model to simulate the effects of space flight on bone metabolism. Thyroid hormones accelerate bone metabolism. Thus, supraphysiologic doses of this hormone might be used as a model to accelerate bone metabolism during bed rest and potentially simulate space flight. The objective of the study was to quantitate the changes in bone turnover after low doses of triiodothyronine (T(3)) added to short-term bed rest. Nine men and 5 women were restricted to bed rest for 28 days with their heads positioned 6 degrees below their feet. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or oral T(3) at doses of 50 to 75 microg/d in a single-blind fashion. Calcium balance was measured over 5-day periods; and T(3), thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured weekly. Triiodothyronine increased 2-fold in the men and 5-fold in the women during treatment, suppressing both thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Calcium balance was negative by 300 to 400 mg/d in the T(3)-treated volunteers, primarily because of the increased fecal loss that was not present in the placebo group. Urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, a marker of bone resorption, increased 60% in the placebo group during bed rest, but more than doubled in the T(3)-treated subjects (P < .01), suggesting that bone resorption was enhanced by treatment with T(3). Changes in serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, markers of bone formation, were similar in T(3)- and placebo-treated subjects. Triiodothyronine increases bone resorption and fecal calcium loss in subjects at bed rest.",Excluded

Patients were implanted with either the SeeLens MF IOL or the SN6AD1 IOL. Postoperative straylight values, visual acuity, and refractive outcomes were compared., RESULTS: The SeeLens MF IOL was implanted in 84 eyes and the SN6AD1 IOL in 79 eyes. The difference in straylight was 0.08 (P = .01), with the SeeLens MF IOL having less straylight. Postoperative CDVA was logMAR -0.03 +/- 0.06 in the SeeLens MF group, and logMAR -0.02 +/- 0.08 in the SN6AD1 group. Mean postoperative refraction was +0.01 +/- 0.43 and +0.06 +/- 0.35 D, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: The Seelens MF IOL showed a stray-light of log(s) 0.08 lower than the SN6AD1 IOL. In terms of spherical equivalent and visual acuity the lenses performed equally. More study will aid in understanding the causes and clinical impact of this difference.

4153,"Seroprevalence and its impact on radiographic damage in korean rheumatoid arthritis patients starting biologics Background/Purpose: High titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACCP) are poor prognostic factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Only few studies have investigated the detailed clinical subtypes or radiographic changes based on serologic status; double (RF/ACCP) positive (+ve), RF or ACCP +ve, double negative (-ve) (seronegative, SN). We aimed to analyze the clinical and radiographic features of RA patients with robust disease activity, based on their serologic status. Method(s): RA patients registered in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry (KOBIO), a nationwide inception cohort, were analyzed. Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidity, disease activity, medication, imaging and laboratory exams were utilized. After adjusting for gender, age, disease duration, and smoking history, we analyzed the association of seropositivity and bony erosion (hands and feet X-ray), and the association of the ACCP titer and joint damage, both at baseline (initiation of biologics) presented as odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval [95% CI]. Result(s): Data of 1198 RA patients were investigated. Mean age was 57.2 years, and disease duration was 8.3 +/- 7.6 years. Mean DAS28-ESR was 5.71, and erosion were found in 40.1% of patients. Being ACCP+ve was significantly associated with bony erosions (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.52], p= 0.0096), compared with RF+ve (OR 1.03 p= 0.83), or RF+ve/ACCP+ve (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.19-4.01], p= 0.012). Of note, being ACCP+ve/RF-ve was strongly associated with radiographic damage (OR 4.93 [95% CI 2.29-10.61], p< 0.0001) in our analysis (figure). In contrast, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ACCP titers were not positively associated with joint damage; a multivariate linear regression model revealed disease duration (estimate -3.95, p< 0.0001) and RF titer (estimate +0.0665, p= 0.0157) were associated with ACCP titers. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate the significance of ACCP in predicting radiographic damage in established Korean RA patients with persistently high disease activity. Longitudinal studies would be needed to clarify the impact of ACCP titers on radiographic progression. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
3766,"Pleomorphic adenomas: post-operative radiotherapy is unnecessary following primary incomplete excision: a retrospective review BACKGROUND: Current standard treatment of Pleomorphic Salivary Adenoma (PSA) of the Parotid Gland is by surgical excision. The management of incomplete excision remains undecided with post-operative radiotherapy advocated by some and observation by others., METHODS: 190 patients who underwent resection of PSA of the parotid gland within the West of Scotland region from 1981 to 2008 were identified and data collected., RESULTS: 78/190 patients had a primary incomplete excision. 25/78 received post-operative radiotherapy and 53 were observed. Recurrences occurred in 11/53 in those observed and in 1/25 of those who received radiotherapy. 21/25 complained of significant side effects from the radiotherapy. 38 surgeons performed 190 procedures, with a range of experience from 1 to28 procedures., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy does appear to reduce recurrence with incomplete excision, however it is associated with significant side effects. We therefore feel radiotherapy should not be routinely recommended. Subspecialisation should be adopted to increase the operating surgeon's experience.

The aim of the study was to analyze the potential of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for the diagnosis of sialolithiasis and to compare the results with those of sonography and sialendoscopy., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis., METHODS: The data of 43 patients with suspected sialolithiasis were evaluated retrospectively. All patients had CBCT and sonographic imaging and received sialendoscopy to confirm and possibly treat sialolithiasis., RESULTS: Sonography, CBCT, and sialendoscopy together indicated sialolithiasis in 33 patients. The mean maximum diameter of the extracted sialoliths did not significantly differ between the three diagnostics. Each diagnostic tool showed an excellent specificity and positive predictive value. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were best in sialendoscopy (94% resp. 83%), followed by CBCT (79% resp. 56%) and then sonography (70% resp. 47%)., CONCLUSION: The results revealed that CBCT is capable of diagnosing sialoliths in general and tended to be more sensitive than sonography.

4254,"A role for neutrophil elastase in the progression of solar elastosis Hairless (SKH-1) mice were mated with Beige (C57B/bb) mice to produce a hairless mouse deficient in neutrophil elastase (hhbb). These mice were exposed to 0.09J UVB irradiation for 5 months to see if neutrophil elastase was an important factor in elastin remodeling and development of solar elastoses. Analysis of peritoneal neutrophils confirmed that the hhbb mouse was deficient in elastase, retaining only 10% as much activity as the normal littermates (hhHb). Skin MPO activity was equally elevated in all the mice receiving UVB suggesting an equal influx of inflammatory cells. The absolute breaking strength of the skin in both the hhBb and hhbb mice was not altered by UVB treatment over the 5 month exposure period. Elastin quantitated biochemically as desmosine, or visualized histologically, was increased following UVB exposure in the normal mice. In the elastase deficient mice, however, the elastin fibers appeared to be unaffected by exposure to UVB irradiation at this level. The results suggest that neutrophil elastase is an important mediator in the development of solar elastosis resulting from continued exposure to UVB irradiation.",Excluded

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 224 DTC patients with primary tumor > 1 cm of diameter or multifocal were randomised into prospective clinical trial. Patients with extrathyroideal extension of primary tumor and nodal metastases or M1 were not enrolled. 99 patients received 60 mCi, and 125--100 mCi of radioiodine as the first ablative dose. RESULT(S): The effectiveness of thyroid ablation was evaluated after one year, during endogenous TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) stimulation, and after two years during Lthyroxine therapy. Whole body scintigraphy (WBS) was performed under thyroxine withdrawal and thyroglobulin serum level was assessed. Distant micrometastases were detected in 9.8% of patients by post-therapy WBS, 11 patients in group A treated with 60 mCi and 11 in group B treated with 100 mCi. In other patients no symptoms of persistent disease were detected. At one year follow up full remission was diagnosed in 176 patients: 76 in group A and 100 in group B. The remaining ones, 13.3% and 11.2% respectively, received the second course of (131)I for remnant ablation. There were no statistically significant differences in Tg (thyroglobulin) serum level either 12 or 24 months after 131I treatment. CONCLUSION(S): Our evaluation of early efficacy of adjuvant radioiodine treatment in low risk DTC patients shows no differences between two radioiodine activities - 60 and 100 mCi in relation to thyroid ablation. Thus, the activity of 60 mCi is recommended.",Excluded

The alternate system was used for a repeated TACE (treatment interval, 0.5-6 months). Fluoroscopy time, number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), air kerma (AK), and dose area product (DAP) were compared between the two systems and between the two repetitive TACE. Three interventional radiologists independently rated the image quality in blinded offline readings., RESULTS: Fluoroscopy time (8.7 +/- 5.9 minutes vs. 8.7 +/- 7.9 minutes, P = .981), numbers of DSA runs (6 +/- 4 vs. 6 +/- 4, P = .735), and exposure images (173 +/- 86 vs. 168 +/- 91, P = .916) were equivalent between the two systems. No statistical difference in X-ray usage was found between repeated treatments. Compared to the reference system, the technology significantly reduced AK and DAP by 48.6% (0.17 +/- 0.13 Gy vs. 0.41 +/- 0.36 Gy, P < .0001) and 50.3% (77.3 +/- 55.2 Gy cm(2) vs. 195.0 +/- 155.5 Gy cm(2), P < .0001), respectively. Image quality was rated comparable between the new system and the reference, with average scores of 3.9 +/- 0.3 versus 4.4 +/- 0.3 in fluoroscopy and 4.5 +/- 0.2 versus 4.3 +/- 0.3 in DSA., CONCLUSIONS: Patient radiation exposure can be substantially reduced by a factor of approximately two with the novel X-ray imaging technology while maintaining image quality.

3819,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
4869,"Damage of nasal mucociliary movement after intensity-modulated radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation usually results in paranasal sinusitis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which influences patients' quality of life. This study aimed to determine the relationships between dose distribution in the nasal cavity and nasal mucous injury in patients with NPC treated by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and to find the tolerable radiation dose for the nasal mucous., METHODS: Sixty-six patients with NPC treated by IMRT between October 2006 and November 2008 were enrolled. The irradiation dose in the nasal cavity was determined by the computer with the IMRT work platform. Mucociliary transport rate (MTR) was detected by modified saccharine test before IMRT, at the end of IMRT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after IMRT., RESULTS: The data were available for 129 nasal cavities. The cavities receiving a mean dose below or equal to 37 Gy showed substantial preservation of nasal mucous after IMRT. The MRT decreased to (62.82 +/- 38.59)%, (56.78 +/- 37.79)%, (64.05 +/- 39.37)%, and (71.13 +/- 39.55)% of pre-IMRT value at 4 time points after IMRT, with significant differences among the data (P < 0.05). In contrast, when the cavities received a mean dose higher than 37 Gy, no significant differences in MTR among the time points were observed. At 3 months after IMRT, the MTR was the lowest (38.27% of pre-RT value)., CONCLUSIONS: A mean radiation dose of <= 37 Gy for the nasal cavity is an optimal dose to protect the nasal cavity function.",Excluded

Over a 12-month period, hand and eye radiation exposure was prospectively measured in a single board-certified hand surgeon using mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Twenty-five cases were performed utilizing mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Average monthly hand radiation dosage (45.81+/-14.49 mrem) was significantly higher (p = .01) than eye radiation dosage (<30 mrem). Both recorded values were below their respective critical exposure limits, as reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection.

4893,"Tactile influences on astronaut visual spatial orientation: human neurovestibular studies on SLS-2 Human spatial orientation in spaceflight is initially disturbed by the absence of usable graviceptor information from the otolithic organs. Experiments measuring astronaut visually induced motion (vection) strength on various flight days during the first 10 days of the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 mission demonstrated two new phenomena in addition to confirming the initial increased weighting of visual and localized tactile cues. The reliance on tactile and visual noninertial cues apparently declined after a week in space, as the crew became able to utilize their internal reference frame. Subjects also showed that even nondirectional tactile cues served as a direction anchor and inhibited visually induced roll sensation relative to a new loosely tethered test condition. Individual perceptual styles were again revealed among the four astronauts tested. The readaptation to 1 G similarly shows a period of reinterpretation of inertial and visual cues to spatial orientation. The results are discussed in terms of an internal-model representation of body orientation, with time-varying weights applied to extrinsic and intrinsic signals.",Excluded

Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NMA) in patients with multiple myeloma treated at the Department of Haematology of the University Medical Centre Utrecht. Thirty-six patients received NMA as part of the first-line treatment; 23 patients as part of salvage therapy. Conditioning regimen was low-dose total body irradiation (TBI, 2 Grays) only; fludarabine was added in patients without previous autologous stem cell transplantation and patients with matched unrelated donors received antithymocyte globulin in addition to fludarabine and TBI. Result(s): Following NMA overall response increased from 84 to 90%, complete remission rate from 15 to 32%. As part of first-line treatment NMA induced complete remission in 50% of patients vs one patient (4%) treated for relapsed multiple myeloma. Median progression-free survival was 26 months (13 months for the salvage group, 38 months for the 'upfront' patients). Median overall survival has not been reached yet. The achievement of complete remission following NMA as part of first-line treatment was associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Major toxicities were acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease occurring in 64% (23% grade 3-4) and in 54% (49% extensive) patients, respectively. Seven patients (12%) died from nonrelapse mortality, five patients (9%) directly related to toxicity of NMA. Conclusion(s): NMA in multiple myeloma is feasible, is associated with acceptable nonrelapse mortality and may induce prolonged complete remission. In pretreated patients the result of NMA is disappointing which urges new strategies. © 2007 Van Zuiden Communications B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4832,Cord blood transplantation using minimum conditioning regimens for patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by severe infections Patients with severe infections are thought to be ineligible for cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBT) because the conventional 5-6 day-conditioning regimens potentially makes them susceptible to fatal infections by the time neutrophil engraftment occurs. Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m2 fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT. The AML patient received 40 mg/m2 of melphalan on day-2 to reduce the leukemia burden. Both patients achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 19 and day 20 after CBT without an apparent exacerbation of the infections and remained in remission at 23 and 18 months after the CBT. These findings suggest that the 1-2 day regimens excluding antihuman thymocyte globulin may be sufficiently potent to ensure engraftment of CB in immunocompromised patients and safely administered even when patients are complicated by active infections. © 2008 The Japanese Society of Hematology.,Excluded
4826,"Renal atrophy after stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma BACKGROUND: Renal atrophy is observed in an irradiated kidney. The aim of this study was to determine dose-volume histogram parameters and other factors that predict renal atrophy after 10-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)., METHODS: A total of 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) who received SBRT for RCC at Tohoku University Hospital between April 2010 and February 2014 were analyzed. The median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl and two patients had a single kidney. Nine patients were implanted with fiducial markers. The median tumor diameter was 30 mm. SBRT was delivered at 70 Gy in 10 fractions for 7 tumors, at 60 Gy in 10 fractions for 2 tumors, and at 50 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 tumors with 6 and/or 15 MV X-ray using 5 to 8 multi-static beams. Renal atrophy was assessed using post-SBRT CT images after 12-24 months intervals. Correlations were examined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Differences between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and pairwise comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: The median tumor volume shrunk from 14.8 cc to 10.6 cc (p = 0.12), and the median irradiated kidney volume changed from 160.4 cc to 137.1 cc (p < .01). The median peak creatinine level was 1.6 mg/dl after treatment (p < .01). Percentage volumes of the irradiated kidney receiving at least 10 Gy (V10, p = 0.03), V20 (p < .01), V30(p < .01), V40 (p = 0.01), mean irradiated kidney dose (p < .01), and magnitude of overlap between PTV and kidney volume (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with post-treatment irradiated kidney volume in percent, and V20-V30 had strong correlation (r < -0.70, p < .01). Patients with implanted fiducial markers showed a significantly lower ratio of renal atrophy (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant renal atrophic change was observed. Dose distribution of SBRT at 20-30 Gy had a strong correlation with renal atrophy when irradiation was performed in 10 fractions.",Excluded
4598,"Dosimetric implications of the addition of 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in CT-based radiotherapy planning for non-small-cell lung cancer Summary The aim of this study was to assess the impact of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) CT on radiotherapy planning parameters for patients treated curatively with radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Five patients with stages I-III NSCLC underwent a diagnostic FDG-PET CT (dPET CT), planning FDG-PET CT (pPET CT) and a simulation CT (RTP CT). For each patient, three radiation oncologists delineated a gross tumour volume based on RTP CT alone, and fused with dPET CT and pPET CT. Standard expansions were used to generate PTVs, and a 3D conformal plan was created. Normal tissue doses were compared between plans. Coverage of pPET CT PTV by the plans based on RTP CT and dPET CT was assessed, and tumour control probabilities were calculated. Mean PTV was similar between RTP CT, dPET CT and pPET CT, although there were significant inter-observer differences in four patients. The plans, however, showed no significant differences in doses to lung, oesophagus, heart or spinal cord. The RTP CT plan and dPET CT plan significantly underdosed the pPET PTV in two patients with minimum doses ranging from 12 to 63% of prescribed dose. Coverage by the 95% isodose was suboptimal in these patients, but this did not translate into poorer tumour control probability. The effect of fused FDG-PET varied between observers. The addition of dPET and pPET did not significantly change the radiotherapy planning parameters. Although FDG-PET is of benefit in tumour delineation, its effect on normal tissue complication probability and tumour control probability cannot be predicted.",Excluded
4913,"Induction chemotherapy with cisplatin and ifosfamide in locally advanced inoperable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A single-institution experience BACKGROUND: Induction chemotherapy (ICT) in patients with head and neck cancer has been studied since a long time. The addition of taxanes to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (PF) regimen results in superior antitumor activity. We did this study to see the response and toxicity of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). AIMS: The aim of this study was to see the results of ICT using cisplatin and ifosfamide regimen in locally advanced unresectable SCCHN in terms of acute and chronic toxicity and response to treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with Stage III and IV, nonmetastatic SCCHN were enrolled in the study. They were given two cycles of ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide followed by CRT. RESULT(S): After ICT, the overall response rate (ORR) was 75.0% at the primary site and 70.0% at the nodal site. ORR for combined primary and nodal disease was observed to be 67.5%. The complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) for combined primary and nodal site were seen in 4 (10.0%) and 23 (57.5%) patients. Of 32 patients who received CRT after ICT, CR was 53.1% and PR was 31.3%. Mucositis, skin reaction, and pharyngeal and laryngeal toxicities were the most common but tolerable. CONCLUSION(S): ICT with cisplatin and ifosfamide gives comparable results to the standard paclitaxel, PF regimen. We conclude that this combination regimen for ICT is not only an economical alternative of taxol-based regimen but also well tolerated by the patients.Copyright © 2017 Indian Journal of Cancer.",Excluded
4992,"Results of the radiation dose of head, body and tail of hippocampus in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy This study is to analyze the radiation dose of head, body and tail of hippocampus (HC) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).

3995,"Normal tissue complication probability modeling for cochlea constraints to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy Background: Radiation-induced tinnitus is a side effect of radiotherapy in the inner ear for cancers of the head and neck. Effective dose constraints for protecting the cochlea are under-reported. The aim of this study is to determine the cochlea dose limitation to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck cancer (HNC) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Method(s): In total 211 patients with HNC were included; the side effects of radiotherapy were investigated for 422 inner ears in the cohort. Forty-nine of the four hundred and twenty-two samples (11.6%) developed grade 2+ tinnitus symptoms after IMRT, as diagnosed by a clinician. The Late Effects of Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT-SOMA) criteria were used for tinnitus evaluation. The logistic and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models were used for the analyses. Result(s): The NTCP-fitted parameters were TD 50 = 46.31Gy (95% CI, 41.46-52.50),GAMMA 50 = 1.27 (95% CI, 1.02-1.55), and TD 50 = 46.52Gy (95% CI, 41.91-53.43), m = 0.35 (95% CI, 0.30-0.42) for the logistic and LKB models, respectively. The suggested guideline TD 20 for the tolerance dose to produce a 20% complication rate within a specific period of time was TD 20 = 33.62Gy (95% CI, 30.15-38.27) (logistic) and TD 20 = 32.82Gy (95% CI, 29.58-37.69) (LKB). Conclusion(s): To maintain the incidence of grade 2+ tinnitus toxicity <20% in IMRT, we suggest that the mean dose to the cochlea should be <32Gy. However, models should not be extrapolated to other patient populations without further verification and should first be confirmed before clinical implementation.Copyright © 2015 Lee et al.",Excluded
4268,"Urological applications of computerized axial tomography Computerized tomography (CT scanning) of the chest and abdomen has been used as a diagnostic technique in more than 7,200 patients since 1974, 250 of whom had histological proved disorders of the genitourinary system and retroperitoneum. On the basis of this experience CT scanning has been found to be safe and effective, and offers certain advantages over conventional techniques. The number, extent and content of adrenal and renal mass lesions can be determined with relatively great accuracy. The presence and extent of metastases into the retroperitoneum, liver and chest often can be shown by CT scanning when other tests are negative. Placement of needles for aspiration, biopsy, injection of contrast medium or insertion of drainage tubes can be done accurately under computerized tomographic control. Air contrast scanning of the bladder can be of real help in staging bladder tumors, espically in obese patients. Computerized tomography in itself is non-invasive, carries a low radiation exposure comparable to other radiographic procedures and therefore, can, be valuable in following the course of patients with various diseases during and after therapy. While CT scanning will not replace other diagnostic procedures it should lead to a more judicious selection of potentially hazardous tests, such as angiography, aspiration and open biopsy.",Excluded
4801,"Anatomic distribution of supraclavicular lymph node in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Definitive chemoradiation therapy remains the standard of care for patients with localized esophageal carcinoma who choose nonsurgical management. However, there is no consensus regarding delineation of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn), especially for lower cervical lymph nodes. This study aimed to map the location of metastatic supraclavicular lymph nodes in thoracic esophageal carcinoma patients with supraclavicular node involvement and generate an atlas to delineate the CTVn for elective nodal radiation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Patients and Methods: In this study, the supraclavicular regional lymph node was further divided into four subgroups. The locations of the involved supraclavicular nodes for all patients were then transferred onto a template computed tomography (CT) image. A volume probability map was then generated with nodal volumes, and was displayed on the template CT to provide a visual impression of nodal frequencies and anatomic distribution. Result(s): We identified 154 supraclavicular nodal metastases based on CT image in 96 patients. Of these, 29.2% were located in group I region, 59.7% in group II region, 10.4% in group III region, and 0.7% in group IV region. Conclusion(s): On the basis of our study, we suggest that the appropriate radiation field of CTVn should include the group I and II regions and the CTVn exterior margin along the lateral side of the internal jugular vein may be suitable.Copyright © 2016 Xing et al.",Excluded
4537,"Relative Safety of External Beam Radiation Therapy in Lung Transplant Recipients Who Develop Thoracic Malignancies We report outcomes for three patients who previously received lung transplants, subsequently developed malignancies, and were given radiation therapy to the chest for treatment of their cancers despite lack of scientific data on radiation tolerance of transplanted lung. None of three patients exhibited early or delayed adverse reactions to radiotherapy. For these three cases, the mean dose to the ipsilateral transplanted lung was 10 Gy, and ipsilateral lung relative volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or more was, on average, 22%. These doses are relatively low and would have been considered safe for patients with native lungs. In our opinion, tolerance of transplanted lung to therapeutic radiotherapy clearly requires additional research. While those data are pending, radiation therapy to the thorax should not be ruled out on the basis of having a lung transplant alone, provided lung dose can be maintained as low as possible using meticulous treatment planning.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

4843,"Imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of low-dose computed tomography lumbar spine for evaluating patients with spinal disorders BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Computed tomography (CT) scans of the lumbar spine (CTLS) have demonstrated a higher level of accuracy than plain films and have been used to assess patients with spinal disorder when magnetic resonance imaging is not available. Nevertheless, radiation exposure remains a serious safety concern. Iterative reconstruction (IR) decreases the CT radiation dose for diagnostic imaging. However, the feasibility of using IR in CTLS is unclear., PURPOSE: To evaluate the imaging quality and diagnostic reliability of CTLS with IR., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study., PATIENT SAMPLE: All patients from outpatient departments who suffered from spinal disorders and were referred for CTLS., OUTCOME MEASURES: In acquired CT images, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the dural sac (DS), intervertebral disc (IVD), psoas muscle (PM), and L5 vertebral body, the contrast-to-noise ratio between the DS and IVD (D-D CNR), and the subjective imaging qualities were compared across groups. Interobserver agreement was evaluated with kappa values., METHODS: Patients receiving low radiation CTLS were divided into three groups. A 150 mAs tube current with 120 kVp tube voltage was used with Group A and a 230 mAs tube current with 100 kVp tube voltage with Group B. Intended end radiation exposure was 50% less than that of the control group. Tube modulation was active for all groups. The images of the two low-radiation groups were reconstructed by IR; those of the control group by filtered back-projection (FBP)., RESULTS: The SNRs of the DS, IVD, PM, BM, and D-D CNR of Group A were not inferior to those of the control group. All SNRs and D-D CNRs for Group B were inferior to those of the control group. Except for that of the facet joint, all subjective imaging ratings for anatomic regions were equivalent between Groups A and B. Interobserver agreement was highest for the control group (0.72-0.88), followed by Group A (0.69-0.83) and B (0.55-0.83)., CONCLUSIONS: Fifty percent tube current reduction combined with IR provides equivalent diagnostic accuracy and improved patient safety when compared with conventional CTLS. Our results support its use as a screening tool. With the tube modulation technique, further adjustments in weighting IR and FBP algorithms based on body mass index become unnecessary.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4761,"The effect of pre-phototest sun exposure on minimal erythema dose and minimal melanogenic dose among skin phototypes III, IV and V Background: Ethnicity, skin phototype and colour influenced minimal erythema dose (MED). Sun exposure has been postulated to increase MED. We determined immediate pigment darkening dose to UVA (IPDDA), MED and minimal melanogenic dose (MMD) for UVB and UVA, and investigated factors affecting these doses. Method(s): Skin phototype was determined using Fitzpatrick phototype quiz, DSMII ColorMeter measured skin colours, sun exposure quantified using an index (SEI) and phototest performed with MEDlight-Multitester. Result(s): A total of 167 healthy volunteers participated. There were 110 (66%) females and 56 (34%) males; 124 (74.7%) were Malay, 27 (16.3%) Chinese and 14 (8.4%) Indians. One hundred and nine (65.7%) skin phototype IV, 30 (18.1%) phototype III and 27 (16.3%) phototype V. IPDDA ranges from 6 +/- 1.5-5.7 +/- 1.4 J/cm2. MED-UVB were 96.9 +/- 17.6, 124 +/- 29.3 and 118.6 +/- 27.4 mJ/cm2 for phototype III, IV and V, respectively. All MED-UVA were outside the tested dose range of 3.6-11 J/cm2. MMD-UVB were 106 +/- 18.2, 134 +/- 25.6 and 136 +/- 31.1 mJ/cm2 while MMD-UVA were 4.1 +/- 4.1, 4.9 +/- 3.8 and 5.7 +/- 3.7 J/cm2 respectively for phototypes III, IV and V. MED-UVB, MMD-UVB and MMD-UVA did not depend on skin phototype. Facultative skin whiteness (L*), erythema (E) and melanin content (M) correlated significantly with MED-UVB while constitutive skin colours were significant for L*, yellowness (b*), E and M. Sun exposure did not significantly correlate with MED-UVB and MMDs, however, an inverse relationship with MED-UVB was demonstrated. Conclusion(s): Minimal erythema doses in our cohort were slightly different from other regional countries. Constitutive and facultative skin whiteness, erythema and melanin content correlated with MED. There was no association between skin phototype and sun exposure with MED or MMD.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Excluded

Subjective complaints were documented by the 39-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-39) and a straylight questionnaire., RESULTS: The population comprised 217 patients with a mean age of 72 years +/- 9.12 (SD) (range 29 to 90 years). Preoperatively, the mean straylight was 1.55 +/- 0.29 log(s) and the mean CDVA, 0.28 +/- 0.21 logMAR. Visual acuity and straylight showed little correlation (R(2) = 0.08). The mean postoperative improvement in CDVA was 0.26 +/- 0.20 logMAR (range -0.12 to 1.12 logMAR) and in straylight, 0.31 +/- 0.32 log(s) (range -0.50 to 1.27 log[s]). The preoperative breakeven point (50% chance of postoperative improvement) was 0.06 logMAR for CDVA and 1.29 log(s) for straylight. Preoperative and postoperative questionnaires showed straylight had almost the same influence as visual acuity on quality of vision., CONCLUSIONS: Straylight and visual acuity measure different aspects of quality of vision and influenced subjective visual quality almost equally.

4033,"Is computerised 3D templating more accurate than 2D templating to predict size of components in primary total hip arthroplasty? Introduction: The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of preoperative templating in total hip arthroplasty (THA) using conventional 2-dimensional (2D) and computed tomography (CT)-based 3-dimensional (3D) measures. Method(s): One hundred and sixteen consecutive primary THAs were analysed. The preoperative diagnosis was primary osteoarthritis in all cases. The 2D templating and the 3D templating were performed by two different residents. All templating results were available for the orthopaedic surgeon performing the procedure. Accuracies with regard to the predicted and actual implant sizes were determined for each procedure. Implantation of the size as planned was defined as ""exact"", whereas the use of components within one size larger or smaller (+/-1) as planned were defined as ""accurate."" Results: The 3D templating was significantly more accurate in predicting implant sizing compared to 2D templating for primary total hip arthroplasty (THA). The difference was statistically significant for the cup templating (''exact'' p = 0.02; ''accurate'' p = 0.01) and for the stem templating (''exact'' p = 0.04; ''accurate'' p = 0.01).

4492,"Post-Fukushima radiation education for Japanese high school students in affected areas and its positive effects on their radiation literacy In post-Fukushima Japan, radiation education is very important, and the subject is being actively discussed. However, little information is available about the amount of knowledge students initially had about radiation or about how well radiation education improves their understanding. Using the questionnaire results of 717 students completed before and after radiation lectures held in three high schools in Fukushima, we examined the number of answers to the questionnaire aligned with the evidence base, and classified the students into clusters based on radiation-related behavior and attitudes to assess the effectiveness of the lecture. The contents of the lectures consisted of (i) scientific knowledge relating to radiation, (ii) results of radiation examinations conducted locally following the disaster and (iii) measures and precautions for daily radiation protection. Associations between the type of knowledge and radiation-related behavior and attitude were also examined to determine which type of knowledge was more important for deepening students' understanding of radiation. This study revealed that radiation education in high schools was effective for students with respect to acquiring relevant basic and practical knowledge; however, the effects of the radiation lecture differed greatly between schools, presumably due to differences in the delivery and atmosphere of the lecture. The present study also suggested that radiation education may positively transform student attitudes and behaviors related to radiation. To enable such a change in awareness, the acquisition of scientific knowledge is essential, for it enables individuals to make better decisions about important matters in their daily lives.",Excluded
4303,"Combined use of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction technique in coronary CT angiography Purpose: To analyze the effect of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation (APSCM) and iterative reconstruction on image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and radiation dose at computed tomographic (CT) angiography and compare it with APSCM-only and body mass index (BMI)-based examination protocols. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol.

3806,"Evaluation of light-emitting diode (LED-835 NM) application over human gingival fibroblast: An in vitro study Since the laser and photomodulation were discovered over 50 years, they have been used for many applications in medicine and in dentistry also. In particular, light-emitting diodes therapy (LT) achieved a great success in medical treatment and photo-therapy. In the decades, LT has been used for several therapeutic purposes. Many beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, cell differentiation, immune potentiating and tissue repair activities. Beneficial effects of LT have also been observed in clinical settings. Although there are lots of cell culture studies in low-level laser therapy, there are only a few cell culture studies in LT that have similar characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LT on primary human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF) on elastin (ELN) gene activation using Real Time PCR. ELN gene activation is directly connected with elastin protein production and HGF functionality. Human gingival tissue biopsies were obtained from three healthy patients during tooth extraction. The gingival specimens were fragmented with a scalpel and transferred in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FBS) and antibiotics, i.e. penicillin 100U/ml and streptomycin 100mug/ml. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37C. The medium was changed the next day and twice a week. After 15 days, the samples of gingival tissue were removed from the culture dishes. Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h incubation. Human gingival fibroblasts at the second passage were seeded on multiple 6-well plates. The cells stimulation was performed with a light-emitting diodes (LEDs) medical device type E-Light. The LED irradiation seems to be directly correlated with the elastin (ELN) gene activation. Interestingly, ELN gene expression in the cultured human gingival fibroblasts seems to be inversely related to the patients' age; in fact, its expression tends to decrease with aging. In summary, the result of the present study shows that LED irradiation promoted ELN gene expression more in elderly than in younger adults.Copyright © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.",Excluded
4120,"Efficacy of RADPAD R protection drape in reducing radiation exposure to the primary operator during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) BACKGROUND: The efficacy of RADPAD R (a sterile, lead-free drape) has been demonstrated to reduce the scatter radiation to the primary operator during fluoroscopic procedures. However, the use of the RADPAD R during TAVI procedures has not been studied. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now an established treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are deemed inoperable or at high risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Consequently the radiation exposure to the patient and the interventional team from this procedure has become a matter of interest and importance. Methods to reduce radiation exposure to the interventional team during this procedure should be actively investigated. In this single center prospective study, we determined the radiation dose during this procedure and the efficacy of RADPAD R in reducing the radiation dose to the primary operator., METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients due to undergo elective TAVI procedures were identified. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo the procedure with or without the use of a RADPAD R drape. There were 25 patients in each group and dosimetry was performed at the left eye level of the primary operator. The dosimeter was commenced at the start of the procedure, and the dose was recorded immediately after the end of the procedure. Fluoroscopy times and DAP were also recorded prospectively., RESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent transfemoral TAVI using a RADPAD R and 25 with no-RADPAD R. The mean primary operator radiation dose was significantly lower in the RADPAD group at 14.8 mSv vs. 24.3 mSv in the no-RADPAD group (P=0.008). There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy times or dose-area products between the two patient groups.

Method(s): Eight patients with stage III NSCLC who were candidated for 3DCRT were enrolled. All the patients had PET-CT scans and SPECT scans. The imagings were accurately co-registered in the planning system. The PET-CT images were used to define the gross tumor volume, and the SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused ""functioning"" lung (FL). The planning objective was to minimize the dose to FL. Statistical analysis was made for the difference between the two sets of 3DCRT plans. Result(s): After 3DCRT was optimized, both the percentage of whole lung volume received dose >=xGy (WLVx) and the percentage of functional lung volume received dose >=xGy (FLVx) were decreased. However, the FLVx was decreased significantly. There were significant differences in WLV10, WLV15, WLV20, WLV25, WLV30 and FLV10, FLV15, FLV20, FLV25, FLV30 between before and after the 3DCRT was optimized (P=0.001, 0.002, 0.014, 0.046, 0.017 and 0.000, 0.000, 0.004, 0.027, 0.023).

Phosphorylated Smad was detected by western blotting; Smad in the cells was labeled by an immunofluorescent antibody and observed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy., RESULTS: The optical density of ALP stimulated by US at 1.5 MHz and 90 mW/cm(2) for 20 min/d was significantly higher than in other groups (P < .01); therefore, this dosage was considered optimal for promoting osteogenic differentiation. After 13 days of US exposure, ALP increased gradually after 5 days, peaked at 11 days, and decreased at 13 days, with a significant difference compared with the control group (P < .05). Osteocalcin production increased from 9 to 13 days and peaked at 15 days, with a significant difference compared with the control group (P < .05). BMP-2 and BMP-6 increased dynamically after exposure for 13 days. BMP-2 increased 6.07-fold at 3 days, 6.39-fold at 11 days, and 5.97-fold at 13 days. BMP-6 expression increased 6.82-fold at 1 day and 51.5-fold at 3 days and decreased thereafter. BMP-9 was not expressed. Phospho-Smad1/5/8 expression was significantly increased after exposure (P< .05) and transferred from the cytoplasm into the nuclei., CONCLUSIONS: Low-intensity pulsed US effectively induced osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells, and the BMP-Smad signaling pathway was involved in the mechanism.",Excluded
