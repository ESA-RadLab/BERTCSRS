4,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers. Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

24,"Sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients., METHODS: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

42,"Thyroid nodules in the population living around semipalatinsk nuclear test site: Possible implications for dose-response relationships study. The risk of radiation-induced nodules is higher than the risk for radiation-induced cancer. Risk factors and specific modifiers of the dose-response relationship may vary among different populations and not be well recognized. Many thyroid studies have considered thyroid nodularity itself, but not specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. There are many specific types of thyroid nodules which follow a morphological classification of thyroid lesions, including some congenital and tumor-like conditions. Modern equipment and technique can help us to identify particular specific types of thyroid nodules. In this study we report some results of a clinically applicable approach to materials derived from three studies. From 1999 through 2002, we have screened 571 current residents from 4 exposed and 1 control village near the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site area, who were of similar ages (<20) at the time of major radiation fallout events at the SNTS. Prevalent nodules were identified by ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, cytopathology results. Analysis of ultrasound images and cytopathology of thyroid lesions among exposed and non-exposed population allowed us to distinguish some interesting ultrasound features for specific types of thyroid nodules. We believe that it would be interesting and possibly more informative for thyroid dosimetry studies to consider specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. We need more detailed research to clarify the feasibility of applying these findings for study of the dose-response relationship.",Included

70,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs. The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included

No individual dosimetry data were available. A comparison with results from currently active uranium miners suggests that the individuals examined at the Jachymov spa had accumulated effective doses in the order of several tens of mSv, very similar to those of the miners., CONCLUSION: The spa personnel in Jachymov needs to be monitored on an individual level.",Included
115,"Faecal microbiota transplantation protects against radiation-induced toxicity. Severe radiation exposure may cause acute radiation syndrome, a possibly fatal condition requiring effective therapy. Gut microbiota can be manipulated to fight against many diseases. We explored whether intestinal microbe transplantation could alleviate radiation-induced toxicity. High-throughput sequencing showed that gastrointestinal bacterial community composition differed between male and female mice and was associated with susceptibility to radiation toxicity. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) increased the survival rate of irradiated animals, elevated peripheral white blood cell counts and improved gastrointestinal tract function and intestinal epithelial integrity in irradiated male and female mice. FMT preserved the intestinal bacterial composition and retained mRNA and long non-coding RNA expression profiles of host small intestines in a sex-specific fashion. Despite promoting angiogenesis, sex-matched FMT did not accelerate the proliferation of cancer cells in vivo. FMT might serve as a therapeutic to mitigate radiation-induced toxicity and improve the prognosis of tumour patients after radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between previous radiation exposure and idiopathic perifoveal telangiectasis (IPT)., DESIGN: A multicentered, individually matched, case-control study design was used. PARTICIPANTS /CONTROLS: Sixty-five case subjects were matched with 175 control subjects. Individuals with unequivocal evidence of angiographically confirmed IPT were included as cases. Control subjects were matched for center, age, and gender., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main exposures of interest were a history of therapeutic head or neck irradiation and environmental radiation exposure., METHODS: A standardized questionnaire was administered to case and control subjects. Data were collected for the main exposures of interest as well as pertinent covariates. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate therapeutic and environmental radiation as risks for IPT., RESULTS: On univariate analysis, head or neck irradiation was associated with IPT (odds ratios [OR] = 4.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30-13.24). While controlling for diabetes and family history of diabetes, IPT was found to be associated with both head or neck irradiation (OR = 4.06, 95% CI = 1.20-13.76) and with environmental irradiation (OR = 6.73, 95% CI = 1.06-42.74)., CONCLUSIONS: This study presents a previously unreported association between prior radiation exposure and IPT.",Included

172,"Mortality and cancer incidence following occupational radiation exposure: third analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers. Mortality and cancer incidence were studied in the National Registry for Radiation Workers in, relative to earlier analyses, an enlarged cohort of 174 541 persons, with longer follow-up (to 2001) and, for the first time, cancer registration data. SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included
188,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1. Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included
199,"Do persons living near a uranium processing site have evidence of increased somatic cell gene mutations? A first study. The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included

Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included

245,"X-ray enhancement of splenic rosette-forming cells in nonimmune mice. The formation of rosettes between spleen cells from nonimmune mice and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) has been investigated. The number of splenic rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the intact spleen was very low but greatly increased after sublethal whole body x-irradiation. These cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AKR anti-C3H- antigen antiserum, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, but not with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum. The splenic RFC also increased after cortisone acetate administration into mice. These results suggest that the RFC are a T cell sub-population having x-ray resistant and cortisone-insensitive characteristics. The x-irradiation of mice in vivo selectively increased the number of splenic RFC in consequence of reduction in the number of cells having non-T cell characteristics. These RFC are presumably antigen-specific sheep red blood cell rosettes, a quite different situation as in the case of human T lymphocyte rosette formation.",Included
246,"Cytogenetic responses to G2 phase X-irradiation of cells from retinoblastoma patients.

The mean CAF was 39 +/- 1.0, range 30-46, for cells from normal subjects, compared to a mean of 245.6, range 101-506, for cells from hereditary RB patients (p < 10-6).

Furthermore, in two families, PHA-stimulated blood lymphocytes from RB patients, one bilateral and one unilateral, and from certain unaffected first-degree relatives after G2 phase X-irradiation had a high CAF (>= 110) compared to a CAF (>= 53) of cells from three normal donors sampled at the same time. These results were shown not to be related to differences in cell cycle progression or initial extent of chromatid damage. The results suggest that the high frequency of chromatid aberrations in the cells from hereditary RB patients results from a genetic deficiency in DNA repair.",Included

335,"Radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro. Exposure to low doses of radiation and/or chemicals can prime an organism to withstand the stress of a subsequent exposure to higher doses of the same agent. In the case of radiation, this phenomenon has been called radioadaptive response. Cytogenetic studies have been undertaken in human lymphocytes to investigate adaptive response (AR) to ionizing radiation, in particular to seek the role of variables such as priming dose, cell cycle stage, and age and gender of the donor. We demonstrated that pre-exposure of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures to very low doses in the range of about 1 cGy (priming or adaptive dose [AD]) reduced the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells induced by 100 cGy - that is, produced an AR in these cells in vitro. However, pre-exposure of cells to 10.0 cGy did not reduce the chromosomal damage (micronuclei) induced by the challenging dose (CD) of 100 cGy under the same protocol, thus exhibiting an inverse dose-response relationship. There was marked variability in the AR among the individuals investigated in the study. The extent of AR also depended on the stage of cell cycle exposed to the CD of radiation. Maximum AR was observed when CD of 100 cGy was given 4 hours after AD, 30 hours following the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes. The least AR was observed when CD was given 48 hours after stimulation. Interestingly, AR was also found to be dependent on the age of the donor, a decrease in AR being observed with an increasing age. No significant difference in AR was observed between male and female donors. To understand the molecular events underlying AR, protein synthesis patterns were studied in human lymphocytes subjected to mitogen, heat, or radiation stress. Heat shock (45 degreeC, for 15 min) induced 7 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 40 to 80 kDa, while treatment with phytohemagglutinin (40 mug/ mL) showed induction of 2 proteins of molecular weights 38 and 48 kDa, respectively. However, exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to gamma radiation did not significantly induce synthesis of any protein, up to 800 cGy dose. Lack of induction of proteins by gamma radiation in human lymphocytes contrasts with the previous reports showing X-ray radiation-enhanced gene expression in melanoma cells and/or human tumor fibroblasts.",Included

The present study assessed whether exhaled breath analysis using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) could screen for radiation exposure. As the intensity of proton transfer reaction reagent ion H3(16)O(+) can be calculated with the intensity of H3(18)O(+), the intensity of H3(18)O(+) was monitored to observe the stability of the PTR-MS instrument during the experiment. The PTR-MS was applied for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath from 42 radiotherapy patients and other 61 patients who had not received radiotherapy. All patients were enrolled in the local cancer hospital. In the experiment, the subjects breathe slowly to the PTR-MS through a direct inlet system without any sampling bag or tube. The breath mass spectrometric data was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis to find the characteristic ions of radiation exposure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for a combination of the characteristic ions. The PTR-MS instrument was stable as the intensity of reaction ion H3(16)O(+) was maintained in 1.1%. Through statistically analysis, we found 6 kinds of characteristic ions of radiation exposure, specifically mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 93, m/z 41, m/z 102, m/z 79, m/z 131, and m/z 143.

The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key proangiogenic factor and determine whether there is any correlation between its expression and clinical symptoms or endoscopic changes in patients with chronic radiation proctitis (ChRP)., METHOD: Fifty patients who had all undergone radiotherapy for prostate, cervical or uterine cancer were included in the study (37 women, 13 men). There was a control group of 20 patients (9 women, 11 men). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scoring system was used for grading the severity of the proctitis. Endoscopic scoring of late rectal mucosal damage was performed using Gilinsky's classification. Serum levels of VEGF were analysed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method., RESULTS: Most patients presented with Grade 1 symptoms. Endoscopic assessment showed that most patients had Grade 1 late rectal mucosal damage. The predominant endoscopic finding was the presence of telangiectasia. Assessment of VEGF correlation between the control group and the degrees of endoscopic changes showed statistically significant differences for all three degrees (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0251 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Due to the small numbers of patients with Grades 2 and 3 symptoms using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system, they were grouped with Grades 1 and 4 respectively forming two groups for statistical purposes. VEGF expression differed significantly between controls and group I and between controls and group II (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in VEGF expression was found to correlate with clinical symptoms and endoscopic rectal mucosa changes in patients with ChRP, suggesting that it may play an important role in pathological angiogenesis.

Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91).

392,"Asesment of lymphoid neoplasm risk factors in people ocupationaly exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Objective: To estimate the incidence of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue (MNLT) among employees of the Siberian Chemical Combine (SC) occupationally exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The radioprotective effect of Cimetidine and IMOD was assessed individually and compared with the hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs-IMOD and Cimetidine) on human lymphocyte cells., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (ten men and ten women) participated in the present study. About 75 mL peripheral blood lymphocytes from each individual were collected, and they were divided into 36 groups. Briefly, the blood samples were treated with different concentrations of Cimetidine (12.6 and 25.2 mug/mL) and IMOD (0.04, 0.08, and 0.12 mg/mL), and also a combination of these agents, namely hybrid radioprotectors agents (HRPAs). Besides, the irradiated groups were exposed to 2 and 4 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. The amount of cellular damage was assessed using the micronucleus assay. The repeated measurements and paired T-test statistical analysis were used to compare the micronucleus frequencies in different groups., RESULTS: The micronucleus frequencies were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) in irradiated groups when the non-toxic concentrations of Cimetidine, IMOD, and HRPAs have been used. The reduction in micronucleus frequency was obtained 5-29% for Cimetidine and 40-51% for IMOD in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated with 2 Gy. This reduction in 4 Gy irradiation was 8-17% for Cimetidine and 27-37% for IMOD. The HRPAs resulted in a higher radioprotective effect, in a way that they cause up to 58% and 43% micronucleus frequency reduction in 2 and 4 Gy, respectively., CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the HRPAs showed the highest level of radioprotective. In addition, IMOD was remarkably higher radioprotective than Cimetidine, which may be related to its greater non-toxic concentrations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included

424,"Multidrug resistance determinants in acute myeloid leukemia developed in persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl accident. The results of multidrug resistance determinants expression analysis on leukemic cells of 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by immunophenotyping are presented. Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included
431,"Lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. PURPOSE: Interventional medical radiation workers represent an under-studied population worldwide, although they receive relatively high occupational radiation doses. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. METHOD(S): A field survey of interventional medical workers in nationwide branches of the Korean Society of Interventional Radiology was conducted in 2017. Organ-specific radiation doses were estimated using national dose registry data and conversion coefficients provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR) were calculated based on realistic exposure scenarios using a radiation risk assessment tool. RESULT(S): LARs from occupational radiation exposure until the age of retirement for all cancers combined were 338 (90.3-796.1), 121 (33.5-288.7), and 156 (41.1-390.6) per 100,000 individuals for male radiologists, male radiologic technologists, and female nurses, respectively. LFR for all cancers combined ranged from 0.22% (0.06-0.53) to 0.63% (0.17-1.47). Regarding the organ site, the highest LAR and LFR among all groups were observed for thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides timely evidence of potential cancer burden from the current levels of occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. The risks varied by occupational groups, and workers, particularly interventional radiologists, need to be carefully monitored for radiation.",Included

In 44 persons (25 women and 15 men), workers handling X-ray equipment in X-ray laboratories the ability was studied of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction by neutrophils. The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2. Neutrophil phagocytic activity is weakened in persons working over five years with X-ray equipment.",Included
461,"Relationship between anthropometric factors, radiation exposure, and colon cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors. PURPOSE: We examined colon cancer risk in atomic bomb survivors to investigate whether excess body weight after the bombings alters sensitivity to radiation effects., METHODS: Of the 56,064 Japanese atomic bomb survivors with follow-up through 2002 with self-reported anthropometric data obtained from periodic mail surveys, 1,142 were diagnosed with colon cancer. We evaluated the influence of body mass index (BMI) and height on radiation-associated colon cancer risk using Poisson regression., RESULTS: We observed a similar linear dose-response relationship for the 56,064 subjects included in our analysis and the entire cohort of Japanese atomic bomb survivors [excess relative risk (ERR) per Gray (Gy) = 0.53, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.86]. Elevation in earliest reported BMI, BMI reported closest to colon cancer diagnosis, and time-varying BMI were associated with an elevated risk of colon cancer [relative risk (RR) per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI = 1.14, 95 % CI 1.03-1.26; RR = 1.16, 95 % CI 1.05-1.27; and RR = 1.15, 95 % CI 1.04-1.27, respectively]. Height was not significantly related to colon cancer risk. Inclusion of anthropometric variables in models had little impact on radiation risk estimates, and there was no evidence that sensitivity to the effect of radiation on colon cancer risk depended on BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure and BMI are both risk factors for colon cancer. BMI at various times after exposure to the atomic bombings does not significantly influence the relationship between radiation dose and colon cancer risk, suggesting that BMI and radiation impact colon cancer risk independently of each other.",Included

Total mesentery preparations of the rat after single total irradiation at the dose levels of 15 and 30 Gy were examined by V. V. Kupriyanov 's method and staining by N.E. Yarigin and S.V. Panchenko . Monotonous pathomorphological changes characteristic of microcirculation disorders were revealed such as blood overdistribution into the venous part of microvasculature prestasis , stasis and lymphostasis. Apart from these qualitative alterations, morphometry of certain parts of microvasculature was performed and some indexes and ratios were calculated. Changes of quantitative parameters were as follows: increase of the capillaries, postcapillaries and venules diameter, increase of their surface and volume, increase of diameter of pericapillary diffusion zone; decrease of the correlation ratio between total arteriolar influx and total venular blood passage within a mesentery segment; decrease of the calculated linear speed of blood in capillaries, postcapillaries and venulas .",Included
522,"Tumorigenicity of human malignant lymphoblasts: comparative study with unmanipulated nude mice, antilymphocyte serum-treated nude mice, and X-irradiated nude mice. The ability of unmanipulated, antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated, and X-irradiated nude BALB/c female mice (in their 13th backcross generation) to serve as hosts for 10 human lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as for peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy humans was compared. The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included

The four doses given to male parents in the F1 generation decreased the average number of eggs per mated female, the percentage of egg hatching and the percentage of mating in both the male and female lines; the effects increased with the dose. Dose dependence of the reduction in the fecundity and the percentage of egg hatching among the female line pairings (female descendants of irradiated parental male pupae) was more significant than among the male line pairings (male descendants of irradiated parental male pupae).

Alkaline phosphatase activity appeared in the male only. The intestinal metaplasia induced by stomach antigen injection in the male persisted longer than in the female. Moreover, the incidence of intestinal metaplasia caused by whole body irradiation in ovariectomized rats was significantly higher than in the sham-ovariectomized ones. Therefore, it is likely that male sex hormones are promoting while female sex hormones are inhibiting the development of intestinal metaplasia.",Included
527,"Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells produce large quantities of bioactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after radiation exposure. PURPOSE: In the present study, we examined human Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cell lines that are able to produce TNF-alpha as part of the response to irradiation. Radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may enhance irradiation efficacy and improve the effect of local tumor irradiation. On the other hand, radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may adversely affect the normal tissue., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve different ES/pPNET cell lines were investigated in vitro and (after establishment as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice) in vivo for their TNF-alpha mRNA expression (real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and TNF-alpha protein production (in vitro: enhanced amplified sensitivity immunoassay; in vivo: immunohistochemistry) after exposure to different irradiation doses (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Gy) and after different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after irradiation). The bioactivity of the TNF-alpha protein was evaluated in chromogenic cytotoxicity and neutralization assays., RESULTS: Nine out of 12 ES/pPNET cell lines express constitutively significant quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha in vitro. ES/pPNET cells originating from primary tumors secreted higher TNF-alpha levels than cells derived from metastatic lesions. In 5 of the 9 TNF-alpha-producing cell lines, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were upregulated after irradiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After establishment of the ES/pPNET cell lines in athymic nude mice, the radiation-induced TNF-alpha release could be demonstrated also in the xenograft tumors in vivo (analogous to the in vitro experiments). Using the same methods for quantitative analysis, it was determined that the TNF-alpha expression of the radiation-responsive tumor cells was up to 2000-fold higher compared to the maximal radiation-induced TNF-alpha release in normal lung tissue measured during the pneumonic phase., CONCLUSION: Certain ES/pPNET cell lines produce extremely large quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha after radiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation-induced TNF-alpha production of tumor cells may be of paramount importance in respect to not only tumor behavior, but also to potential damage to normal tissue and the clinical status of the host.",Included

After 31 hr of their initiation, groups of cultures were subsequently exposed to a challenging dose of 100 cGy gamma radiation (dose rate 82 cGy/min.). Eight males in the age group ranging from 25 to 55 years and eight females (age group 25 to 29 years), have been analysed during this study. Analysis of data revealed 40.6% reduction in the frequency of mn-BNCs among the males with a range from 25.7% to 54.7%. In case of females, also the per cent reduction varied from 26.3% to 49.0%, with a mean value of 33.7%.

580,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy. Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included
585,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion. The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included
594,"Genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomas and K-ras gene mutation in mice after exposure to X-rays and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. PURPOSE: Ras activation is one of the major mechanisms for the development of murine thymic lymphomas by radiation and chemical carcinogens. To gain insight into the relationship between genetic susceptibility and ras gene mutation, the frequency and spectrum of ras gene mutation was examined in thymic lymphomas from susceptible and resistant mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: K- and N-ras mutations in thymic lymphomas that arose in X-ray-irradiated and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice of susceptible C57BL/6, rather resistant C3H and their hybrid B6C3F1 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing., RESULTS: C57BL/6 exhibited a higher incidence of thymic lymphomas after exposure to X-rays and ENU than C3H, with B6C3F1 being intermediate. K-ras gene mutations occurred frequently in the pathogenesis of ENU-induced thymic lymphomas in susceptible C57BL/6 as opposed to resistant C3H. The ras mutations were more frequent in ENU-induced thymic lymphomas than X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, and with the latter, there was no clear evidence for strain differences, suggesting that the genetic susceptibility to X-rays was independent of ras activation. The mutations of K-ras in thymic lymphomas from C57BL/6 were predominantly GGT to GAT in codon 12, whereas this mutation type was never found in those from C3H. No strain difference was observed in the nucleotide sequence or expression levels of O(6)-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, indicating that this enzyme did not account for the genetic susceptibility to ras activation., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a clear strain and carcinogen dependency of K-ras mutation and that the frequency of ras mutation might determine the genetic susceptibility to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis, whereas pathways independent of ras activation might determine the susceptibility to X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis.",Included
602,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood. BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs.

Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included

The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a Canadian cohort of 337 397 individuals (169 256 men and 168 141 women) occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and included in the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, such as those received during radiotherapy, leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The emerging evidence of excess risk of CVDs after exposure to doses well below those previously considered as safe warrants epidemiological studies of populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. In the present study, the cohort consisted of employees at nuclear power stations (nuclear workers) as well as medical, dental and industrial workers. The mean whole body radiation dose was 8.6 mSv for men and 1.2 mSv for women. RESULT(S): During the study period (1951-1995), as many as 3 533 deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been identified (3 018 among men and 515 among women). In the cohort, CVD mortality was significantly lower than in the general population of Canada. The cohort showed a significant dose response both among men and women. Risk estimates of CVD mortality in the NDR cohort, when expressed as excess relative risk per unit dose, were higher than those in most other occupational cohorts and higher than in the studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. CONCLUSION(S): The study has demonstrated a strong positive association between radiation dose and the risk of CVD mortality. Caution needs to be exercised when interpreting these results, due to the potential bias introduced by dosimetry uncertainties, the possible record linkage errors, and especially by the lack of adjustment for non-radiation risk factors.",Included

In this paper thyroid tumor data from the 1971 survey of the Rochester, New York thymus irradiated population are further analyzed to study radiobiological and host factors. The analyses were based on the approximately 2650 irradiated subjects and 4800 sibling controls who had 5 or more years of follow-up. Twenty-four thyroid cancers and 52 thyroid adenomas were found in the irradiated group, and 0 thyroid cancers and 6 adenomas among the controls. The overall risk estimates were 3.8 thyroid cancers/106 PY-rad and 4.5 thyroid adenomas/106 PY-rad. The dose-response data (thyroid dose range of 5 to > 1000 rad) for thyroid cancer indicate both a linear and a dose-squared component, but no dose-squared component is evident for thyroid adenomas. At lower total doses (< 400 rad) there was a suggestion that dose fractionation diminished the thyroid cancer response, but a similar fractionation effect was not found for thyroid adenomas. The temporal pattern of tumors suggested an extended plateau of excess tumor production, rather than a 'wavelike' temporal pattern. There was no evidence for an inverse relationship between thyroid radiation dose and thyroid cancer latency. Female and Jewish subjects had a higher risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer than did their respective counterparts. The additive and multiplicative models of radiation effects were compared with respect to sex differences; neither model provided a superior fit to the data. The tentative nature of the conclusion is stressed because of the relatively small number of thyroid cancers.",Included

According to chronic exposure of radiation workers during their work experience,this study was an attempt to assess the damage caused by radiation on the hair of radiation workers. In this study the total Skin and Hair Analyzing System capable of registering polarized images was used for measuring hair parameters (hair thickness,hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil). Hair management software ,Skin Management Software and also 150X,700X lenses were used to measure the hair parameters. The study included one questionnaire which it's face validity and content validity was approved by pilot study and some professional experts. The participants were 152 hospital personnel and were divided into radiation exposed group (radiotherapy technicians,nuclear medicine technicians) and control group (nurses) and were homogenized based on age,work situation,work time,work experience and baldness (family history). Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers. The reason may be inadequate training of technologists and their high workload.Copyright © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.",Included

The tumors arose in the terminal ductal-lobular units as either lobular acinar carcinoma or cystadenocarcinoma or as papillary carcinomas within large ducts near the mammilla. About half the number of the males had terminal ductal-lobular carcinomas and all but 2 of the papillary duct carcinomas also arose in males. Large tumors frequently exhibited squamous, chondromatous, osseous, fatty and myoepitheliomatous types of tissues. In 2 irradiated males and 1 female the tumors metastasized. Whole-body irradiation did not produce significant changes in the number or sex distribution or in the morphology of mammary gland tumors in inbred or outbred guinea pigs. All females had cystic ovaries without increase in granulosa cells, 24 (66.6%) had uterine tumors and 13 (34.2%) had adrenal gland tumors; all males had atrophic testes, 5 (16.5%) had testicular and 6 (22.2%) had adrenal gland tumors.",Included

710,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test. Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included

752,"Evaluation of radiation-induced changes to parotid glands following conventional radiotherapy in patients with nasopharygneal carcinoma. Objectives: Xerostomia is a common post-radiotherapy (post-RT) complication in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included
757,"[Phosphorylation of histone H2AX in human lymphocytes as a possible marker of effective cellular response to ionizing radiation]. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included
758,"Ionizing radiation regulates the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in epithelial cancer cells: modulation of cellular signals regulating cell cycle and survival. PURPOSE: To analyze the (i) expression of AMPK in a variety of epithelial cancer cells, (ii) regulation of AMPK subunit expression by ionizing radiation (IR) and (iii) impact of AMPK on signaling pathways regulating cell cycle and survival., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human lung, prostate, and breast normal and cancer cells were treated with 0 or 8 Gy IR and mRNA and protein levels of AMPK were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting 24 or 48 h later. Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKalpha(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR., RESULTS: AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays., CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKalpha knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.

794,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005). Objective To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort. Methods We analysed 65 719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-Associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors. Results Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/ neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/ Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45). Conclusions Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.",Included

Nine patients who did not agree with radiation therapy, and therefore underwent rotational atherectomy and balloon angioplasty for diffuse in-stent restenosis in the same study period, were selected for control groups. Serial IVUS comparisons were available in 44 of 50 patients with radiation therapy and 7 of 9 control patients. At 6-month follow-up, there was less significant increase of IH area in patients with radiation therapy than in control patients (Delta IH area = 0.1 +/- 0.8 mm(2) vs. 2.6 +/- 1.8 mm(2), P > 0.001 in mean values, and 0.6 +/- 1.4 mm(2) vs. 2.9 +/- 2.1 mm(2), P = 0.026 in values of follow-up lesion site, respectively).

812,"Radiation-induced comet-formation in human skin fibroblasts from radiotherapy patients with different normal tissue reactions. Background: In clinical radiotherapy most patients tolerate the applied dosage with no or moderate side effects. However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included

Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

Purpose: A dose-response study was performed in swine to investigate the vascular effects of 32P over a broad range of doses in order to define the therapeutic window of intracoronary radiotherapy (ICR) with 32P. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included

857,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas. BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included
861,"Late effects in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with 224Ra. This study is comprised of 1577 ankylosing spondylitis patients from 9 German hospitals who have been treated with multiple injections of 224Ra. The majority of the patients, most of them treated in the years 1948-1975, received one series of 10 weekly intravenous injections of about 1 MBq of 224Ra each. This dose leads to a mean absorbed dose due to alpha-particle radiation of 0.56 Gy to the marrow-free skeleton of a 70-kg man (mean bone surface dose of about 5 Gy). To provide comparative information on causes of death and on health effects possibly related to the basic disease itself, a control group of 1462 ankylosing spondylitis patients with roughly the same age distribution has been established. By the end of 1998, 649 patients in the exposed group and 762 control patients had died. Among other observations, it is of particular interest that 13 cases of leukemia in the exposed group have been observed. This is a highly significant excess (P < 0.001) compared to a standard population, but only a marginally significant excess in comparison to the seven cases observed in the control group. Subclassification of the leukemias shows a clear preponderance of the myeloid leukemias in the exposed group (8 cases observed compared to 1.7 cases expected, P < 0.001), whereas in the control group the observed cases are within the expected range for myeloid leukemia (3 cases observed compared to 2.2 cases expected, P = 0.3). The 224Ra cohort of the earlier study (higher-dose group) has provided a risk coefficient that predicts about 8 excess malignant bone tumors for the irradiated cohort in this study.

Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

881,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type. The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

893,"Estimating the incidence of leukemia attributable to occupational exposure in Iran. Objective: The aim this study was to estimate the fraction of leukemia incidence in Iran attributable to occupational exposure to benzene, ionizing radiation, and ethylene oxide. Method(s): Nationwide exposure to each of these leukemogens was estimated using workforce data available at the ILO (International Labor Organization) website. The prevalence of exposure to leukemogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database. The magnitude of the relative risk of leukemia for each leukemogen was from published literature. Using the Levin's population attributable risk (incidence), fractions of leukemia incidences attributed to workplace leukemogens were then estimated. Result(s): The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census included 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture was the largest sector with 24.5% of the males and 0.27% of the females, and the electricals-related sector was the smallest with 1.16% of the males and 0.66% of the females. After applying the CAREX exposure estimates to each sector, the proportion exposed to leukemogens was 0.016% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI of 3.2-4.2) for high exposure and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.1) for low exposure and employing the Levin's formula, the fraction of leukemia attributed to leukemogens in the workplaces among females was 3.6% (95% CI of 3.1-4.5) and among males was 7.6% (95% CI of 6.4-9.2). These fractions corresponded to estimated incidences of 0.60 (95% CI of 0.50-0.70) and 0.22 (95% CI of 0.16-0.23) cases of leukemia per 100,000 populations for males and females, respectively.

PURPOSE: Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses that result in radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) as well as to determine dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice; these parameters are still undefined in HCC SBRT., METHODS: This study consisted of two phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy-based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. The pathological differences, signs [such as mouse performance status (MPS)], and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of the OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in humans, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiotherapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in a mouse study., RESULTS: The evaluation criteria of the mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs were as follows: MPS >= 2.0 +/- 0.52, AST/ALT >= 589.2 +/- 118.5/137.4 +/- 15.3 U/L, serum albumin <= 16.8 +/- 2.29 g/L. The preliminary dose constraints of the OARs were also obtained, such as those for the liver (average dose <= 26.36 +/- 1.71 Gy) and gastrointestinal tract (maximum dose <= 22.63 Gy). Mouse RILD models were able to be developed when the livers were irradiated with average doses of >=31.76 +/- 1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice have also been validated in HCC patients., CONCLUSIONS: Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for the OARs and evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs, and the authors' results favor the study of further approaches to treat HCC with SBRT.",Included

924,"Cohort profile: four early uranium processing facilities in the US and Canada. PURPOSE: Pooling of individual-level data for workers involved in uranium refining and processing (excluding enrichment) may provide valuable insights into risks from occupational uranium and external ionizing radiation exposures., METHODS: Data were pooled for workers from four uranium processing facilities (Fernald, Mallinckrodt and Middlesex from the U.S.; and Port Hope, Canada). Employment began as early as the 1930s and follow-up was as late as 2017. Workers were exposed to high concentrations of uranium, radium, and their decay products, as well as gamma radiation and ambient radon decay products. Exposure and outcome data were harmonized using similar definitions and dose reconstruction methods. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated., RESULTS: In total, 560 deaths from lung cancer, 503 non-malignant respiratory diseases, 67 renal diseases, 1,596 ischemic heart diseases, and 101 dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) were detected in the pooled cohort of over 12,400 workers (~1,300 females). Mean cumulative doses were 45 millisievert for whole-body external ionizing radiation exposure and 172 milligray for lung dose from radon decay products. Only SMR for dementia and AD among males was statistically significant (SMR=1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.54)., CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to date to examine long-term health risks of uranium processing workers.",Included

940,"Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists. Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Included
958,"Heterogeneity in the clastogenic response to X-rays in lymphocytes from ataxia-telangiectasia heterozygotes and controls. A coded analysis of X-ray-induced chromatid aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from 45 control individuals and 19 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes was performed. The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included
962,"Persistence of chromatid aberrations in the cells of solid mouse tissues exposed to 137Cs gamma radiation. Primary mouse ear and kidney cultures were established for determination of cytogenetic aberrations at short (3 days to 1 month) and long (12-23 months) times after exposure of their right sides to 7.5 Gy of (137)Cs gamma radiation. In every case, higher levels of aberrations were observed in primary cultures established from the irradiated tissues than in those established from the contralateral tissues. The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments. The percentages of cells exhibiting chromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments were also markedly elevated. Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included
984,"Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in laboratory mice experimentally enclosed in the radioactive Chernobyl environment. Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy using the protein-coding cytochrome b (Mtcyb) gene was assessed in laboratory mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) exposed to the Chernobyl environment. Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included
985,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

1057,"Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of radiation-associated and sporadic meningiomas. Ionizing irradiation to the skull is a known risk factor for meningioma development. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated meningioma (RAM), we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas (non-RAM). Most tumors (29/33;87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 (33%) exhibited four or more changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs (2.4+/-1.9) and in non-RAMs (2.5+/-1.9). The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22 (56.2% in RAM, and 47% in non-RAM) and chromosome 1 (37.5% in RAM and 35.3% in non-RAM), with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only. In conclusion, no significant differences were noted between RAMs and non-RAMs regarding the number of genetic changes and the extent and frequency of chromosomes 1 and 22 losses. These preliminary data suggest that the tumorogenic pathways of meningioma formation are similar, regardless of previous skull irradiation.",Included
1059,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model. Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included
1076,"Case-control study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure in Worcester county, Massachusetts. A study of lung cancer risk from residential radon exposure and its radioactive progeny was performed with 200 cases (58% male, 42% female) and 397 controls matched on age and sex, all from the same health maintenance organization. Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included
1082,"Influence of dose rate on survival time for 239PuO2-induced radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis in dogs. Beagle dogs were exposed once or repeatedly to 0.75-microns-diameter monodisperse aerosols of 239PuO2 by pernasal inhalation. The dogs that were exposed once received alveolar depositions (+/- standard deviation) of 3.9 +/- 1.9 kBq/kg body mass and accumulated doses of 23 +/- 8 Gy to the lung before death at 5.4 +/- 1.7 years after exposure. Dogs exposed repeatedly received a total alveolar deposition of 5.3 +/- 0.9 kBq/kg body mass during 7 to 10 semiannual exposures and accumulated doses of 22 +/- 5 Gy to the lung before death at 4.9 +/- 0.7 years after first exposure. Clearance of the plutonium from the lung in the dogs exposed repeatedly was slower than in the dogs exposed once. All dogs in the repeated-exposure study and all but one dog in the single-exposure study died from radiation effects. Pulmonary fibrosis accounted for 72% of the radiation-related deaths in the single-exposure study and 87% in the repeated-exposure study. The remaining dogs died with pulmonary cancer. Based on total cumulative radiation dose, the times after exposure to death from radiation pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis were not significantly different for single and repeated exposures. Thus dose rate does not appear to be an important factor in predicting death from radiation pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis for dogs inhaling 239PuO2.",Included

PURPOSE: Our previous study showed that radiation exposure reduced the diversity of repertoires of memory thymus-derived cells (T cells) with cluster of differentiation (CD)- 4 among atomic-bomb (A-bomb) survivors. To evaluate the maintenance of T-cell memory within A-bomb survivors 60 years after radiation exposure, we examined functionally distinct memory CD4 T-cell subsets in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the survivors., METHODS: Three functionally different subsets of memory CD4 T cells were identified by differential CD43 expression levels and measured using flow cytometry. These subsets consist of functionally mature memory cells, cells weakly responsive to antigenic stimulation, and those cells functionally anergic and prone to spontaneous apoptosis., RESULTS: The percentages of these subsets within the peripheral blood CD4 T-cell pool all significantly increased with age. Percentages of functionally weak and anergic subsets were also found to increase with radiation dose, fitting to a log linear model. Within the memory CD4 T-cell pool, however, there was an inverse association between radiation dose and the percentage of functionally mature memory cells., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the steady state of T cell memory, which is regulated by cell activation and/or cell survival processes in subsets, may have been perturbed by prior radiation exposure among A-bomb survivors.",Included
1105,"NOS1-, NOS3-, PIK3CA-, and MAPK pathways in skin following radiation therapy. Background: Essential molecular pathways such as the MAPK pathway, NO system, or the influence of PIK3CA as an oncogene are known to regulate fundamental signalling networks. However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs. Additional studies should be carried out to identify possible starting points for therapeutic interventions.Copyright © The Author(s). 2017.",Included

1115,"Low dose IR-induced IGF-1-sCLU expression: a p53-repressed expression cascade that interferes with TGFbeta1 signaling to confer a pro-survival bystander effect. Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR <=10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (>=2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>=1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (>=10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFbeta1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFbeta1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFbeta1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing.",Included

Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included

Although body fat distribution is also considered to be a predictor of DM, only a few longitudinal studies have examined the association between DM risk and body composition, estimated directly using such methods as DEXA, in particular with reference to Asian populations who have a higher prevalence of DM at lower BMI levels compared with CaucAsians. Objective(s): To determine whether fat distribution is associated with DM incidence, independently of BMI, in an elderly Japanese population. Method(s): We analyzed 1,550 subjects without DM (472 men and 1,078 women, average age of 65.3 years) in the Adult Health Study, consisting of atomic bomb survivors and their controls, whose body composition was measured using DEXA during the period 1994-96. Fat-mass percentages for the trunk and legs were calculated by dividing each of the specific body partTMs fat mass by total soft tissue mass. DM was defined as glucose 126mg/dl fasting or 200mg/dl nonfasting, or physician-diagnosed DM, or the use of medication for DM. We followed-up through the end of 2011. Result(s): During a mean follow-up period of 11.4 years, 85 men and 110 women developed DM. Almost 20% of men and 28% of women were overweight/obese (BMI25kg/m2) at baseline. After multivariate analysis with adjustment made for age, metabolic syndrome risk factors other than central obesity, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, only overweight/obese women had a significant association with DM incidence compared with non-obese women (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.27). Percentages of trunk fat and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other, after adjustment for age, BMI, and other risk factors. Increased percentage of trunk fat was a significant risk factor for incidence of DM; the RR for 1% increase in trunk fat were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.20) in men and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) in women, whereas, leg fat had protective effects regarding incidence of DM (men RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96, women RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.95, for 1% increase in leg fat). These significant associations were observed for non-obese subjects. Conclusion(s): Trunk and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other.

1176,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc. Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included

Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included

Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0).

Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included
1234,"Effect of fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media on human hematological parameters. Introduction: Fluoroscopic X-rays are widely used for examinations around the world. Technicians often use an iodinated radiographic contrast media during fluoroscopic X-ray examinations. Objective(s): This study examined the impact on hematological parameters for human blood and morphology of red blood cells that were exposed to fluoroscopic X-ray combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media, i.e., iopromid, iohexol, and iodixanol. Method(s): Blood samples from male and female subjects were incubated with 5 mgI/mL of iodinated radiographic contrast media for 5 min, then were irradiated using fluoroscopic X-rays (70 kV, 0.8 mA) for 10, 30, and 60 min. Hematological parameters of the blood samples were determined by a clinical service center, and morphology of red blood cells was examined by light microscope. Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times. Conclusion(s): These finding suggested that there were no harmful effects following fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media when human blood was irradiated in an in vitro condition.Copyright © 2021, Korean Society of Environmental Risk Assessment and Health Science.",Included
1244,"16. The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010. This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included

1318,"Increased circulating cell-free DNA levels and mtDNA fragments in interventional cardiologists occupationally exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccf-DNA) and mtDNA (ccf-mtDNA) have often been used as indicators of cell death and tissue damage in acute and chronic disorders, but little is known about changes in ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA concentrations following radiation exposure. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR. No significant relationships were found between ccf-DNA and ccf-mtDNA, and age, gender, smoking, or other clinical parameters. Ccf-DNA levels (44.2 +/- 31.1 vs. 30.6 +/- 19.2 ng/ml, P = 0.013), ccf-mtDNA-79 (2.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.8, P < 0.01), and ccf-mtDNA-230 copies (2.0 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.02) were significantly higher in interventional cardiologists compared with the non-exposed group. In a subset (n = 15) of interventional cardiologists with a reliable reconstruction of cumulative professional exposure (59.7 +/- 48.4 mSv; range: 1.4-182 mS), ccf-DNA (53.2 +/- 41.3 vs. 36.4 +/- 22.9 and 32.2 +/- 20.5, P = 0.08), mtDNA-79 (2.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 2.03 +/- 1.7 and 1.09 +/- 0.82, P = 0.05), and mtDNA-230 (2.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 1.5 +/- 1.4 and 1.04 +/- 0.9, P = 0.09) tended to be significantly increased in high-exposure subjects compared with both low-exposure interventional cardiologists and controls. Our results provide evidence for a possible role of circulating DNA as a relevant biomarker of cellular damage induced by exposure to chronic low-dose radiation.

1320,"Impact of chemical exposure on cancer mortality in a French cohort of uranium processing workers. BACKGROUND: Nuclear workers may be exposed to a variety of chemical hazards, in addition to radiation. We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility., METHODS: A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals., RESULTS: Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed., CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers.

1346,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective?. BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included

1377,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation. Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

1456,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios. BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included
1461,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes: Link with biomarkers of the CBMN cytome assay in hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of ionising radiation. Individual sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) is the result of interaction between exposure, DNA damage, and its repair, which is why polymorphisms in DNA repair genes could play an important role. We examined the association between DNA damage, expressed as micronuclei (MNi), nuclear buds (NBs), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected DNA repair genes (APE1, hOGG1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XPD, PARP1, MGMT genes; representative of the different DNA repair pathways operating in mammals) in 77 hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of IR, and 70 matched controls. A significantly higher MNi frequency was found in the exposed group (16.2+/-10.4 vs. 11.5+/-9.4; P=0.003) and the effect appeared to be independent from the principal confounding factor. Exposed individuals with hOGG1, XRCC1, PARP1, and MGMT wild-type alleles or APEX1, as well as XPD (rs13181) heterozygous showed a significantly higher MNi frequency than controls with the same genotypes.

1462,"The association between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors in atomic bomb survivors. Atomic bomb (A-bomb) radiation is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic CVD risk factors. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also known to be a risk factor for CVD and little is known whether CKD is associated with A-bomb radiation. To examine whether CKD is associated with CVD risk factors or with A-bomb radiation in A-bomb survivors, we classified renal dysfunction in 1,040 A-bomb survivors who were examined in 2004-2007 as normal [n = 121; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]; mild (n = 686; eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); moderate (n = 217; eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); or severe (n = 16; eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Also, we diagnosed subjects in the moderate and severe renal dysfunction groups as having CKD (n = 233; eGFR <59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking and drinking habits, we looked for an association between renal dysfunction and hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and between renal dysfunction and A-bomb radiation.

Objectives: To investigate the salivary anionic changes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

1498,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance?. It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included
1518,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients. Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included
1531,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation. Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included

This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system.

1596,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster. The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control.

Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150.

Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05).

Surgery did not produce any significant changes in cell-mediated immunity parameters: level of PHA-induced BRL decreased by 16,7%, while total RFC number increased by 17.2% in (mostly low-affinity forms). Preoperative radiation resulted in a significant decrease in lymphocyte ability to undergo PHA-induced blast-transformation (45%) and spontaneous rosette formation, high-affinity lymphocytes being most sensitive to ionizing radiation. Their fraction decreased by half.",Included

AIM: To investigate the effect of antisense compounds (AS) targeting human p53 mRNA on radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells., METHODS: Western blotting and RTPCR were used to analyze the protein content and mRNA level. Additionally, cell proliferation, cell cycle and cell apoptosis were all analyzed in irradiated or sham-irradiated cells., RESULTS: Among the five antisense compounds (AS), AS3 was identified to efficiently inhibit p53 mRNA level and protein content. Interestingly, AS3 transfer has little effect on cell proliferation in DU-145 cells (mutant p53) after ionizing radiation (IR). In contrast, a marked increase of cell apoptosis and growth inhibition were observed in MCF-7 cells (wild-type p53), suggesting that AS3 can increase radiosensitivity of MCF-7 cells. Additionally, it was also observed that the transfection of AS3 decreased the fraction of G1 phase cells, and increased the proportion of S phase cells compared to untreated cells 24 h after IR in MCF-7 cell lines., CONCLUSION: AS3 transfection increases MCF-7 cell apoptosis induced by 5 Gy-radiation, and this mechanism may be closely associated with abrogation of G1 phase arrest.",Included
1647,"Residential radon and risk of lung cancer in an Italian alpine area. To evaluate whether residential radon exposure explains the excess mortality for lung cancer in an Italian alpine valley with high natural radioactivity, the authors conducted a population-based case-control study on 138 deceased cases and 291 sex- and year-of-birth-matched controls. Year-long alpha-track measurements of radon were performed in the most recent residence, and information about occupational history and lifetime smoking habits was obtained. The authors adjusted for smoking, and radon was associated with lung cancer risk among men: compared with a radon level of < 40 becquerels (Bq) per cubic meter (m3), the odds ratios for 40-76 Bq/m3, 77-139 Bq/m3, 140-199 Bq/m3, and 200+ Bq/m3 were 2.1, 2.0, 2.7, and 1.4, respectively. The association between radon and lung cancer, as determined with a multiplicative model, was found only among male smokers.",Included

OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of tumor cell proliferation and sex-hormone receptors on the efficacy of megavoltage irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas., DESIGN: Longitudinal clinical trial., ANIMALS: 20 dogs with incompletely resected intracranial meningiomas., PROCEDURE: Dogs were treated with 48 Gy of radiation administered 3 times per week on an alternate-day schedule of 4 Gy/fraction for 4 weeks, using bilateral parallel-opposed fields., RESULTS: Tumor proliferative fraction measured by immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PFPCNA index) ranged from 10 to 42% (median, 24%). Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Included
1674,"Late side effects of radioactive iodine on salivary gland function in patients with thyroid cancer. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the late side effects of radioiodine therapy (RIT) on salivary gland function. One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included
1741,"The relationship between occupational radiation exposure and thyroid nodules. Background: Considering that thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer occur more frequently in people chronically exposed to radiation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in staff members occupationally exposed to radiation was determined by ultrasonography. The results were compared with the results of another study among the adult population of Isfahan which selected by cluster random sampling method. The 2 studied groups were matched according to sex and age. Result(s): The case and control groups included 124 and 471 persons, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the case and control groups was 22.6% and 24.6%, respectively (p > 0.05). Although thyroid nodules were significantly more prevalent in females in the control group, no such difference was observed between females and males of the case group (p > 0.05). The number of thyroid nodules (single or multiple) and calcification were not different between the two groups (p > 0.05). In addition, hypoechogenicity of thyroid nodules was not different between the two groups for (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): In our study, there was not any correlation between chronic occupational exposure to low dose of radiation and the risk of developing thyroid nodules. Further studies with larger sample sizes, at different doses of radiation, and considering iodine status and thyroid function are thus required.",Included

The response to accelerated neon ions of human Nall melanomas growing in nude mice was measured by an in vitro colony-forming assay following in situ tumor irradiation in the midposition of a 10-cm extended-peak ionization region. Values of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for peak neon ions compared with 60Co gamma radiation were 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, at the 1% and 10% survival levels. Following irradiation with peak neon ions, the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLD) was comparable to that observed after gamma irradiation. When misonidazole (1 mg/g intraperitoneal dose) was administered in combination with extended-peak neon ions, the drug enhancement ratio (ER) at the 1% survival level was 1.5 if the tumors were removed and plated in vitro immediately following irradiation, and 1.9 if tumor excision and plating were delayed for greater than 6 hours. Administration of misonidazole completely inhibited PLD repair following either gamma irradiation or extended-peak neon-ion irradiation.",Included

The effects of carbon ion irradiation and ferulic acid (FA) on the induction of oxidative stress and alteration of gene expression were studied in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1Gy, 3Gy and 7Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn-sod, Mn-sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.

1780,"Generation of a Transcriptional Radiation Exposure Signature in Human Blood Using Long-Read Nanopore Sequencing. In the event of a large-scale event leading to acute ionizing radiation exposure, high-throughput methods would be required to assess individual dose estimates for triage purposes. Blood-based gene expression is a broad source of biomarkers of radiation exposure which have great potential for providing rapid dose estimates for a large population. Time is a crucial component in radiological emergencies and the shipment of blood samples to relevant laboratories presents a concern. In this study, we performed nanopore sequencing analysis to determine if the technology can be used to detect radiation-inducible genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The technology offers not only long-read sequencing but also a portable device which can overcome issues involving sample shipment, and provide faster results. For this goal, blood from nine healthy volunteers was 2 Gy ex vivo X irradiated. After PBMC isolation, irradiated samples were incubated along with the controls for 24 h at 37degreeC. RNA was extracted, poly(A)+ enriched and reverse-transcribed before sequencing. The data generated was analyzed using a Snakemake pipeline modified to handle paired samples. The sequencing analysis identified a radiation signature consisting of 46 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which included 41 protein-coding genes, a long non-coding RNA and four pseudogenes, five of which have been identified as radiation-responsive transcripts for the first time. The genes in which transcriptional expression is most significantly modified after radiation exposure were APOBEC3H and FDXR, presenting a 25-and 28-fold change on average, respectively. These levels of transcriptional response were comparable to results we obtained by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. In vivo exposure analyses showed a transcriptional radioresponse at 24 h postirradiation for both genes together with a strong dose-dependent response in blood irradiated ex vivo. Finally, extrapolating from the data we obtained, the minimum sequencing time required to detect an irradiated sample using APOBEC3H transcripts would be less than 3 min for a total of 50,000 reads. Future improvements, in sample processing and bioinformatic pipeline for specific radiation-responsive transcript identification, will allow the provision of a portable, rapid, real-time biodosimetry platform based on this new sequencing technology. In summary, our data show that nanopore sequencing can identify radiation-responsive genes and can also be used for identification of new transcripts.Copyright © 2020 by Radiation Research Society.

1792,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice. In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
1800,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells.

1804,"Lung cancer mortality associated with protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures and smoking behaviors in U.S. radiologic technologists, 1983-2012. In the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, risk of lung cancer has been shown to increase with greater acute exposure to ionizing radiation. Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years. Our study provides some evidence that greater protracted radiation exposure in the low-dose range is positively associated with lung cancer mortality.Copyright © 2020 UICC",Included

The radiation environment in deep space includes the galactic cosmic radiation with different proportions of all naturally occurring ions from protons to uranium. Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included

We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs.

1945,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers. BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included

Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors., RESULTS: Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.

1990,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function. Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included

2033,"Time-dependence of the effect of X-irradiation on the formation of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and other dehydrogenases in the developing rat brain. X-irradiation (100-1500 r) administered to the heads of rats 8-30 days of age inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (l-glycerol 3-phosphate-NAD oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) in the brain stem and cerebral hemispheres. At 40 days of age and older no effect was observed. This inhibition was a delayed phenomenon, dose-dependent and with no recovery. It is proposed that the inhibition of enzyme formation is related to radiation damage caused to DNA. Actinomycin D inhibited the development of glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in a manner similar to ionizing radiation. Four other dehydrogenases also showed age-dependent radiosensitivities. ;Malic enzyme' (EC 1.1.1.40), lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27) and malate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.37) ceased to be radiosensitive at about 8 days of age and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP) (EC 1.1.1.42) at 16 days. The correlation between developmental increase in enzyme activity and radiosensitivity held closely for glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase and to a smaller extent for the others.",Included

2058,"Risk of stomach cancer incidence in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson's regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag. To estimate the baseline risk, sex, attained age, smoking status and alcohol consumption, chronic diseases (peptic ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis) were taken into account. No modifications of the radiogenic risk by non-radiation factors were found in the study worker cohort. No association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was observed.Copyright: © 2020 Zhuntova et al.

2080,"Association Between Radiation Dose and Outcomes With Postoperative Radiotherapy for N0-N1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. PURPOSE: To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the modern era for N0-N1 margin-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and evaluate the association between PORT dose and overall survival., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nonmetastatic stage II and III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC surgically treated patients within the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival and PORT dose. Radiation modalities included nonconformal beam radiation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy., RESULTS: We identified 2167 (6.7%) and 30,269 (93.3%) patients with surgically resected stage II or III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC who were treated with and without PORT, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with PORT (dose range, 45 to 74 Gy) decreased from 8.9% in 2003 to 2006 to 4.1% in 2010 to 2011. Among patients receiving PORT, the use of high-dose (60 to 74 Gy) PORT rose throughout the study period, starting at 34.8% in 2003 to 2006 and rising to 49.3% in 2010 to 2011.Overall, patients who received PORT had worse survival (hazards ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.40) compared with those not receiving PORT. This association was unchanged when limited to patients receiving modern treatment with 3-CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (hazards ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.65)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of PORT for N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC decreased from 2003 to 2011. We found no evidence of benefit from PORT for resected N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC, regardless of dose or technique. PORT should be approached with caution in this group of patients, regardless of radiotherapy technique.",Included
2088,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice. We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included

UNLABELLED: This study evaluates the use of the 99mTc-DTPA aerosol lung clearance method to investigate radiation-induced lung changes in eight patients undergoing radiotherapy for lung or breast carcinoma. The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included

BACKGROUND: After conventional treatment of in-stent restenosis, the incidence of recurrent clinical restenosis may approach 40%. We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015). The incidence of the composite including death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization was observed in 60 (28.7%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 44 (19.1%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.024). Binary 8-month angiographic restenosis (> or =50% diameter stenosis) within the entire segment treated with radiation was reduced from 45.2% in the placebo-treated patients to 28.8% in the 90Sr/90Y-treated patients (P=0.001). Stent thromboses occurred in 1 patient assigned to placebo <24 hours after the procedure and in 1 patient assigned to 90Sr/90Y at day 244., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that beta-radiation using 90Sr/90Y is both safe and effective for preventing recurrence in patients with in-stent restenosis.",Included
2126,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice. Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included

2160,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company. Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included
2167,"Effects of heavy ions on rabbit tissues: cataractogenesis. As part of an investigation of the responses of optic and proximate tissues to heavy-ion irradiation, the lenses of New Zealand white rabbits were exposed to the Bragg plateau regions of 530 MeV/amu Ar ions and 365 MeV/amu Ne ions and also to 60Co gamma-photons. The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.

Prior studies have shown that intracellular Wolbachia endobacteria are necessary for the normal development, reproduction, and survival of filarial nematodes. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of gamma radiation on Wolbachia and reproduction in Brugia malayi adult worms. Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included

Flt3lg concentrations showed excellent dose discrimination at >= 1 Gy in the time window of 1 to 7 days after exposure except 1 Gy at day 7. Saa1 dose response was limited to the first two days after exposure. A multiplex assay with both proteins showed improved dose classification accuracy.

New sterilization methods for human bone allografts may lead to alterations in bone mechanical properties, which strongly influence short- and medium-term outcomes. In many sterilization procedures, bone allografts are subjected to gamma irradiation, usually with 25 KGy, after treatment and packaging. We used speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on bone. All bone specimens were subjected to the same microbial inactivation procedure. They were then separated into three groups, of which one was treated and not irradiated and two were exposed to 10 and 25 KGy of gamma radiation, respectively. SOS was measured using high- and low-frequency ultrasound beams in each orthogonal direction. SOS and Young modulus were altered significantly in the three groups, compared to native untreated bone. Exposure to 10 or 25 KGy had no noticeable effect on the study variables. The impact of irradiation was small compared to the effects of physical or chemical defatting.

2258,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada. A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive.

2272,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe. Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures.

BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included
2341,"Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro. INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)., METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells., RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells., CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level. Copyright © 2016.

GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT. The majority of the symptom cluster severity scores were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with prostate cancer.""",Included

2373,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model. A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA.

2377,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma. BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS Surgery followed by postoperative RT appears to provide superior local control compared with surgery alone for patients with desmoplastic melanoma.

2396,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect. The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included
2397,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice. In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included

2409,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients. Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001). Chromosomal translocations were more frequent with repeated CT-exposed patients than in CT-naive patients, and a positive dose-response relationship was present between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency.",Included
2417,"p53 expression in human rectal tissue after radiotherapy: upregulation in normal mucosa versus functional loss in rectal carcinomas. PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included

The paper is concerned with the results of a comparative study of radiation injury of chromosomes of human lymphocytes at the G0 stage resulting from the influence of 60Co gamma quanta and high activity 252Cf radiation sources and depending on a dose and dose rate; with the potentialities of modifying a cytogenetic effect of irradiation by postradiation hyperthermia of cells. It has been shown that at the G0 stage of a cell cycle the frequency of chromosome aberrations does not depend on the dose rate of 252Cf radiation within the range of 0.0035-0.35 Gy/min. by the neutron component. Linear correlation between the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations and a dose was observed within a dose range of 0.27-3.1 Gy. Thus, a conclusion is that postradiation hyperthermia at the G0 stage does not almost influence the frequency of chromosome aberrations during 252Cf radiation, and increases it insignificantly during 60Co gamma-radiation.",Included
2427,"Uranium in drinking water: Renal effects of long-term ingestion by an aboriginal community. The authors conducted a study of an aboriginal community to determine if kidney func-tion had been affected by the chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water from the community's drilled wells. Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480). This study indicates that at the observed levels of uranium intake, chemical toxicity would be a greater health concern than would radiation dose. © 2009 Heldref Publications.",Included
2435,"The biomechanical effects of 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation on human bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts. Recent data suggest that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with irradiated allograft tissue may lead to increased failure rates. Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation does not significantly alter the preimplantation biomechanical properties of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts. Controlled laboratory study. Cyclic and failure mechanical properties were evaluated for 20 paired central-third human BTB allografts, with and without 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation. Testing included cyclic loading at 0.5 Hz for 100 cycles from 50 to 200 N and failure testing at a strain rate of 10% per second. Cyclic elongation did not change significantly (P = .151) with irradiation, increasing from a mean +/- SD of 9.4 +/- 2.1 mm to 11.3 +/- 3.4 mm. Cyclic creep strain approached a significant increase with irradiation (1.3% +/- 0.8% to 2.6% +/- 1.5%; P = .076). Failure testing was not affected with irradiation with regard to maximum load (1680 +/- 417 mm to 1494 +/- 435 mm), maximum stress (40.8 +/- 10.6 MPa to 37.5 +/- 15.7 MPa), elongation (7.85 +/- 1.35 mm to 8.67 +/- 2.05 mm), or strain at maximum stress (0.158 +/- 0.03 to 0.175 +/- 0.03). Graft stiffness significantly decreased by 20% with irradiation (278 +/- 67 N/mm to 221 +/- 50 N/mm; P = .035). Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation decreases BTB graft stiffness by 20%, but it does not affect other failure or cyclic parameters. Aside from graft stiffness during load to failure testing, low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation of central-third human BTB allografts is not deleterious to preimplantation biomechanical properties.",Included
2448,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation. Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included

The frequency of translocation, dicentrics (DC) and micronuclei (MN) was studied in blood samples exposed in vitro to 60Co gamma radiation and cervical cancer patients undergoing fractionated radiotherapy. The samples exposed under in vitro condition showed that the frequency of translocation and dicentric followed Poisson distribution ('u' varied between -0.04 and +1.41 for translocation and between -0.09 and +1.81 for DC) and that obtained with MN follow over dispersion ('u' varied between +2.04 and +9.28). However, the cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy showed over dispersion for all these three aberrations (DC, MN and translocation). The frequencies of aberrations obtained in cancer patients were found to be lower than those obtained for in vitro exposure for doses more than 2 Gy equivalent whole body dose (EWBD). The dose-response curves were constructed using the frequencies of DC, MN and translocation as a function of EWBD. Doses as measured from the dose response curves were compared with the estimated dose in order to check whether the measured and estimated doses agree. The percent variation between the doses measured from aberration frequencies and that of the estimated dose was lower with translocation (10.8+/-7.41%) compared to those obtained with DC (38.08+/-31.85%) and MN (47.19+/-31.80%).

PURPOSE: Different doses of X-ray radiation were tested to assess the developmental inhibition effects on different stages of Drosophila suzukii, spotted wing drosophila (SWD). Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy. In the trial at the commercial facility, radiation at 150 Gy to pupae induced complete adult sterility in all combinations of cross-mating between treated or untreated males and females., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that X-ray radiation can be recommended as an alternative to methyl bromide as phytosanitary treatment for quarantine purpose.",Included

2567,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans. Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included

Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%.

Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively.

The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful.

Result(s): One hundred six patients were analyzed, and 19, 71, and 16 patients underwent conventional fractionation, hypofractionation, and hyperfractionation, respectively. The median follow-up was 56 months. The 5-year local control and overall survival rates were 79% and 83%; 78% and 79%; and 87% and 77%, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between the fractionation schedules. Conclusion(s): Our findings confirmed the utility of AFS in standard clinical practice and support its use for patients with EGSCC.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

2795,"Prior exposure to medical and dental x-rays related to tumors of the parotid gland. Findings from this population-based study in Los Angeles County suggest, for the first time, that tumors of the parotid gland are related to prior exposure to diagnostic medical and dental radiography. Responses to interviews with 408 patients with a parotid tumor (269 benign tumors and 139 malignant tumors) were compared to responses of 408 neighborhood controls. Cumulative exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic radiography was associated with a dose-related increase in risk of malignant tumors (P for trend less than .05; relative risk for exposure to greater than or equal to 50 rad = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-11.46). Benign tumors showed a weaker positive association, and exposure before age 20 to a major diagnostic examination (full-mouth or panoramic dental radiography or medical radiography to the head) increased risk (relative risk = 1.8; confidence interval = 1.13-2.91). This study also confirmed the association of malignant tumors with prior radiation treatment to the head or neck; 28% of these tumors are attributable to exposure of the parotid gland from diagnostic and therapeutic radiation.",Included

Pre- or postoperative radiation therapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal carcinoma. Factors related to local recurrence were analyzed retrospectively by uni- and multivariate analysis. One hundred and fifty-five patients (mean age: 65 years) were operated on with curative intent between 1967 and 1984. Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

Currently used dosages for external-beam megavoltage radiation therapy in birds have been extrapolated from mammalian patients and often appear to provide inadequate doses of radiation for effective tumor control. To determine the tolerance doses of cutaneous and mucosal tissues of normal birds in order to provide more effective radiation treatment for tumors that have been shown to be radiation responsive in other species, ingluvial mucosa and the skin over the ingluvies of 9 ring-necked parakeets (Psittacula krameri) were irradiated in 4-Gy fractions to a total dose of either 48, 60, or 72 Gy using an isocentric cobalt-60 teletherapy unit. Minimal radiation-induced epidermal changes were present in the high-dose group histologically. Neither dose-related acute nor chronic radiation effects could be detected in any group grossly in cutaneous or mucosal tissue over a 9-month period. Radiation doses of 72 Gy in 4-Gy fractions were well tolerated in the small number of ring-necked parakeets in this initial tolerance dose study.",Included
2813,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma. PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included

Aims: To review the outcome of patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma in British Columbia between January 1985 and December 1999. Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-five patients were identified. Survival curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the charts of the 62 patients referred to a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) facility were reviewed. Result(s): All cases: 51 out of 75 patients (68%) were women; median age of all patients was 74 years. The overall- and cancer-specific 5-year survival rates for the whole group were 5%. Non-referred cases: nine out of 13 patients were women; median age at diagnosis 84 years. Eleven of the 13 patients died within 1 month of diagnosis. Referred cases: 42 out of 62 patients were women; median age 72 years; median survival 5.1 months; 1-year survival 19%. Forty-eight patients presented with tumours that extended through the thyroid capsule, 10 presented with distant metastases. Four patients had a total thyroidectomy, nine a partial thyroidectomy, and 49 a biopsy only. Fifty-seven patients received radiotherapy, nine of these had concurrent chemotherapy: Thirty-three patients received less than 40 Gy and 24 patients received 40 Gy or more. Median survival was longer (9 vs 3 months) in patients receiving 40 Gy or more; this group included four patients who had prolonged survival.

2830,"Differential effects of genotoxic stress on both concurrent body growth and gradual senescence in the adult zebrafish. Among vertebrates, fish and mammals show intriguing differences in their growth control properties with age. The potential for unlimited or indeterminate growth in a variety of fish species has prompted many questions regarding the senescent phenomena that appear during the aging process in these animals. Using zebrafish as our model system, we have attempted in our current study to examine the growth phenomena in fish in relation to the onset of senescence-associated symptoms, and to evaluate the effects of genotoxic stress on these processes. We observed in the course of these analyses that the zebrafish undergoes continuous growth, irrespective of age, past the point of sexual maturation with gradually decreasing growth rates at later stages. Animal population density, current body size and chronological age also play predominant roles in regulating zebrafish growth and all inversely influence the growth rate. Interestingly, the induction of genotoxic stress by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) did not adversely affect this body growth ability in zebrafish. However, IR was found to chronically debilitate the regeneration of amputated caudal fins and thereby induce high levels of abnormal fin regeneration in the adult zebrafish. In addition, by resembling and mimicking the natural course of aging, IR treatments likewise enhanced several other symptoms of senescence, such as a decline in reproductive abilities, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and a reduction in melatonin secretion. Our current data thus suggest that during the lifespan of zebrafish, the onset of senescence-associated symptoms occurs in parallel with continuous growth throughout mid-adulthood. Moreover, our present findings indicate that genotoxic DNA damage may play a role as a rate-limiting factor during the induction of senescence, but not in the inhibition of continuous, density-dependent growth in adult zebrafish.",Included

Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis. No secondary malignancy occurred during follow-up.

2846,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors. Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included
2848,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures. In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included
2850,"Time sequence of cancer occurrence. Implications in low level radiation risk assessment. A total of 8 229 C57 Black mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to various groups. In some groups, mice aged 33 +/- 3 days were submitted to either sham, neutron or cobalt external radiation at 32, 45, 63, 88 and 123 mGy or at 18, 25, 36 and 51 cGy dose levels, respectively. In other groups, mice either at birth or weaning, were injected with tritiated thymidine or tritiated water, or were given tritiated water as drinking water for the entire lifespan. The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the low dose-response relationship of cancer induction, especially leukemogenesis and to evaluate the excess risk, using actuarial age-specific rates. Following neutron or cobalt exposure, the phenotypic occurrence of lymphocytic lymphomas was earlier in appearance and higher in yield during the first decades of lifespan in irradiated groups versus matching controls, whereas such occurrence was markedly lower in yield at a later age. Under parallel experimental conditions, induction of reticulum cell lymphomas, however, was uniformly enhanced throughout the entire lifespan. Induction rates of all tumors (reticular and solid) pooled were significantly increased, and more so following cobalt than neutron irradiation. In mice injected with tritiated thymidine, the overall tumor incidence was increased monotonically throughout the lifespan. In mice exposed to tritiated water, the incidence of lymphocytic lymphomas was markedly increased throughout the lifespan, whereas no such effect was observed for reticulum cell tumors. In the light of tumor data analysis, it appears that selection of a particular type of tumor as a dependent variable for dose-response assessment cannot disregard the primary modulation of the whole tumor spectrum. In C57 Black murine leukemogenesis, the shape and structure of the dose-response regression curve over the entire lifespan does not fit the linear-quadratic model. It is, however, theorized that our data are consistent with the two-mutation clonal expansion model, assuming creation of initiated cells which are added to the pool of spontaneously occurring initiated cells and implying that the excess risk is initially high at early age and then decreases with increasing age following exposure. It is concluded that murine radiocarcinogenesis investigation may contribute to improving the assessment as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms of low level radiation hazards.

2854,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation. The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included

2861,"Recurrent Atypical Meningiomas: Combining Surgery and Radiosurgery in One Effective Multimodal Treatment. Objective Owing to their rarity and proteiform pathologic features, the clinical behavior of atypical meningiomas is not yet well characterized. Though the extent of resection is believed to be a key determinant of prognosis, limited data exist regarding optimal management of patients with recurrent disease. Methods In this 20-year retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 46 patients with recurrent atypical meningomas (185 lesions, 89 of which were local, 78 marginal, and 18 distant recurrences); treatment was radiosurgery (n = 60), surgery (n = 56), or both (n = 8). The median follow-up period was 53 months. Outcome measures were length of overall survival and disease-free intervals and prognostic factors for survival. Results Overall, the median progression-free survival was 26 months at the first recurrence and 100 months thereafter (the sum of the later intervals). Multivariate analysis showed that no treatment-related factors influenced prognosis, whereas recurrence at the skull base was a significant tumor-related factor limiting further treatment. Irrespective of treatment type, the recurrence-free interval was increasingly shorter during the clinical course, with a higher occurrence of marginal and distant lesions migrating to the midline and to the skull base. In sporadic cases, disease-free intervals were longer after wide craniotomy, tumor and dural resection with tumor-free margin. Conclusions The disease-free interval was substantially similar after surgery and radiosurgery for treating recurrent disease in patients with atypical meningiomas. Surgery is the mainstay for prolonging survival, while radiosurgery can be an adjuvant strategy to gain time for clinical observation and planning aggressive surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included

BALB/c mice are susceptible to gamma-ray induction of lymphomas. The CcS-13 strain is one of 20 CcS/Dcm (CcS) series of recombinant congenic strains, and the CcS-13 mice are resistant to gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas [1, 8].

Radiation exposure is known to have profound effects on the brain, leading to precursor cell dysfunction and debilitating cognitive declines [Nat. Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am.

Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included
2902,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo. Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair.

All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

2925,"Assessment of sexual function in patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy--a single centre prospective study. AIM: The main objective was to delineate the rates and clinical course of sexual function and depression in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight male and 90 female radiotherapy-naive outpatients with breast or pelvic cancer completed the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) or the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) prior to (phase 1), at the end of (phase 2) and 12 months after radiotherapy (phase 3)., RESULTS: Overall, the majority of patients (93.8% of males and 80% of females) experienced intense sexual dysfunction. At presentation, males reported severe erectile dysfunction that was significantly associated with age. However, only in sexual desire was the difference between baseline and phase 3 significant. In females, an improvement was observed in all parameters of FSFI between phase 1 and 3. Females with stage III disease achieved lower scores in almost all parameters of FSFI than those with stage II. Finally, although a quarter of patients reported elevated depression scores, depression was not related to sexual function., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of cancer patients experience intense levels of sexual dysfunction and depression throughout radiotherapy and the subsequent year. Pelvic radiotherapy affected sexual function to a higher degree than did breast radiotherapy.",Included
2939,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis. Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included

2961,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role. Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included

The aim of this study was to assess whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between radiation dose and myocardial fibrosis in patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (nCRT) for esophageal cancer (EC). Methods and Materials: Forty patients with EC treated with a transthoracic esophagectomy with (n = 20) or without (n = 20) nCRT (CROSS study regimen) were included. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (1.5 Tesla) for left ventricular (LV) function, late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping were performed. Extracellular volume (ECV), as a surrogate for collagen burden, was measured for all LV segments separately. The dose-response relationship between ECV and mean radiation dose per LV myocardial segment was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis. Result(s): Seventeen nCRT and 16 control patients were suitable for analysis. The mean time after treatment was 67.6 +/- 8.1 (nCRT) and 122 +/- 35 (controls) months (P = .02). In nCRT patients, we found a significantly higher mean global ECV of 28.2% compared with 24.0% in the controls (P < .001). After nCRT, LV myocardial segments with elevated ECV had received significantly higher radiation doses. In addition, a linear dose-effect relation was found with a 0.136% point increase of ECV for each Gy (P < .001). There were no differences in LV function measures and late gadolinium enhancement between both groups. Conclusion(s): Myocardial ECV was significantly higher in long-term EC survivors after nCRT compared with surgery only. Moreover, this ECV increase was linear with the radiation dose per LV segment, indicating radiation-induced myocardial fibrosis.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Included

2991,"Lack of correlation between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin. The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included

Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included

The Life Span Study (LSS) of Japanese atomic bomb survivors has served as the primary basis for estimates of radiation-related disease risks that inform radiation protection standards. The long-term follow-up of radiation-monitored nuclear workers provides estimates of radiation-cancer associations that complement findings from the LSS. Here, a comparison of radiation-cancer mortality risk estimates derived from the LSS and INWORKS, a large international nuclear worker study, is presented. Restrictions were made, so that the two study populations were similar with respect to ages and periods of exposure, leading to selection of 45,625 A-bomb survivors and 259,350 nuclear workers. For solid cancer, excess relative rates (ERR) per gray (Gy) were 0.28 (90% CI 0.18; 0.38) in the LSS, and 0.29 (90% CI 0.07; 0.53) in INWORKS. A joint analysis of the data allowed for a formal assessment of heterogeneity of the ERR per Gy across the two studies (P=0.909), with minimal evidence of curvature or of a modifying effect of attained age, age at exposure, or sex in either study. There was evidence in both cohorts of modification of the excess absolute risk (EAR) of solid cancer by attained age, with a trend of increasing EAR per Gy with attained age. For leukemia, under a simple linear model, the ERR per Gy was 2.75 (90% CI 1.73; 4.21) in the LSS and 3.15 (90% CI 1.12; 5.72) in INWORKS, with evidence of curvature in the association across the range of dose observed in the LSS but not in INWORKS; the EAR per Gy was 3.54 (90% CI 2.30; 5.05) in the LSS and 2.03 (90% CI 0.36; 4.07) in INWORKS. These findings from different study populations may help understanding of radiation risks, with INWORKS contributing information derived from cohorts of workers with protracted low dose-rate exposures.",Included

Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation.

Health effects of tritium, a beta-emitter and a by-product of the nuclear industry, is a subject of significant controversy. This mouse in vivo study was undertaken to monitor biological effects of low level tritium exposure. Mice were exposed to tritiated drinking water (HTO) at 10 KBq/L, 1 MBq/L and 20 MBq/L concentrations for one month. The treatment did not result in a significant increase of apoptosis in splenocytes. To examine if this low level tritium exposure alters radiosensitivity, the extracted splenocytes were challenged in vitro with 2 Gy gamma-radiation, and apoptotic responses at 1 and 24 h were measured. No alterations in the radiosensitivity were detected in cells from mice exposed to tritium compared to sham-treated mice. In contrast, low dose gamma-irradiation at 20 or 100 mGy, resulted in a significant increase in resistance to apoptotic cell death after 2 Gy irradiation; an indication of the radioadaptive response. Overall, our data suggest that low concentrations of tritium given to mice as HTO in drinking water do not exert cytotoxic effect in splenocytes, nor do they change cellular sensitivity to additional high dose gamma-radiation. The latter may be considered as the lack of a radioadaptive response, typically observed after low dose gamma-irradiation. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Included
3147,"Dynamic in vivo profiling of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy using canine patients as a model. Time resolved data of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy elucidates the relation between damage, repair, and cell survival. While well characterized in vitro, little is known about the time-course of DNA damage response in tumors sampled from individual patients. Kinetics of DNA damage after radiotherapy was assessed in eight dogs using repeated in vivo samples of tumor and co-irradiated normal tissue analyzed with comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) immunohistochemistry. In vivo results were then compared (in silico) with a dynamic mathematical model for DNA damage formation and repair. Maximum %DNA in tail was observed at 15-60 min after irradiation, with a rapid decrease. Time-courses of gammaH2AX-foci paralleled these findings with a small time delay and were not influenced by covariates. The evolutionary parameter search based on %DNA in tail revealed a good fit of the DNA repair model to in vivo data for pooled sarcoma time-courses, but fits for individual sarcoma time-courses suffer from the heterogeneous nature of the in vivo data. It was possible to follow dynamics of comet tail intensity and gammaH2AX-foci during a course of radiation using a minimally invasive approach. DNA repair can be quantitatively investigated as time-courses of individual patients by integrating this resulting data into a dynamic mathematical model.Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

Overall, 3D conformal treatment planning resulted in more homogenous dose distribution to target tissues with lower hot spots and dose ranges. Dose homogeneity and guarantee of not under-dosing target tissues with 3D conformal planning came at the cost, however, of delivering greater mean doses of radiation and of irradiating greater volumes of surrounding normal tissue structures.

After radiotherapy treatment, there is an increased incidence of localized atherosclerosis in patients with Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Here, we established a mouse model to study the development and progression of radiation-induced atherosclerosis and to compare the phenotype of these lesions with age-related atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included
3180,"Different trend for changing of mammalian plasma (serum) antioxidant activity after irradiation at large and low-doses. One of the path for research of antioxidant status in vivo is the determination of blood plasma (serum) antioxidant activity (AOA). AOA is an integral parameter for the contribution of different antiradical defense components which particular nomenclature is determined by a used method of definition. In the present work AOA is studied with usage of a system of suppression in vitro by blood plasma (serum) of a Fe(2+)-induced oxidation of a substrate from egg yolk lipoproteins. The contribution of separate components of a blood plasma to an integral index of AOA for human blood serum is studied. Urine acid, albumin, reduced glutathione, ascorbat, heparin, peroxidase and catalase had no activity.

The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs.

Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3).

The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes.

3272,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up. BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy).

The aim is to clarify expression changes of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice. A mouse model of gamma-ray induced leukemia was produced, and by means of quantitative real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), the expression of mRNA and protein, phosphorylation level, and protein activity of ERK1/2, STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells were investigated in these mice. The results indicated that mRNA and protein expressions of ERK1/2 were upregulated, with significant increase of phosphorylation level and protein activity, but with insignificant differences in mRNA and protein expressions, phosphorylation level and protein activity of STAT3 and SHP-2 in bone marrow cells from gamma-ray induced leukemia mice compared to the radiation/tumor-free or control mice. It is concluded that in the pathogenesis of gamma-ray induced leukemia in Balb/C mice, activated ERK1/2 pathway may play a role, without involving STAT3 pathway; meanwhile, SHP-2 exerts no regulative effect on pathways of Ras-ERK1/2 and JAK-STAT.",Included

3334,"The maximum tolerated dose of gamma radiation to the optic nerve during gamma knife radiosurgery in an animal study. BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

3348,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986. Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
3352,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function. Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included

In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered. Biological aged-related passportization in a definite part of liquidators elucidated an accelerated aging rate.

Objectives To determine cancer mortality compared with the general population and to examine dose-response relationships between cumulative occupational radiation dose and specific cancer outcomes in the German aircrew cohort. Methods For a cohort of 26 846 aircrew personnel, standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated. Dose-response analyses were carried out using Poisson regression to assess dose-related cancer risks for the period 1960-2014. Exposure assessment comprises recently available dose register data for all cohort members and newly estimated retrospective cabin crew doses for 1960-2003. Results SMR for all-cause, specific cancer groups and most individual cancers were reduced in all aircrew groups. The only increases were seen for brain cancer in pilots (n=23, SMR 2.01, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.28) and for malignant melanoma (n=10, SMR 1.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.85). Breast cancer mortality among female cabin crew was similar to the general population (n=71, SMR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.44). Overall median cumulative effective dose was 34.2 mSv (max: 116 mSv) for 1960-2014. No dose-response associations were seen in any of the models. For brain cancer, relative risks were elevated across dose categories. An indicative negative trend with increasing dose category was seen for large intestine cancer in female cabin crew (n=23). Conclusions There was no evidence for significant dose-response patterns for the considered cancer types. Interpretation of results remains difficult as cumulative dose is closely related to age. Future work should focus on investigating radiation jointly with other risk factors that may contribute to risks for specific cancers among aircrew.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Myeloidtranslocation genes (MTGs) are transcriptional corepressorsimplicated in development, malignancy, differentiation, and stem cellfunction. While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included
3431,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells. Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included

3438,"Mortality from solid cancers other than lung, liver, and bone in relation to external dose among plutonium and non-plutonium workers in the Mayak Worker Cohort. Exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented long-term effects on cancer rates and other health outcomes in humans. While in vitro experimental studies had demonstrated that the nature of some radiation effects depend on both total dose of the radiation and the dose rate (i.e., the pattern of dose distribution over time), the question of whether or not the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure depends on the dose rate remains unanswered. Another issue of interest concerns whether or not concomitant exposure to external gamma rays and inhaled plutonium aerosols has any effect on the external exposure effects. The analyses of the present paper focus on the risk of solid cancers at sites other than lung, liver, and bone in Mayak workers. Recent findings are reviewed indicating that there is no evidence of plutonium dose response for these cancers in the Mayak worker cohort. Then the evidence for differences in the external dose effects among workers with and without the potential for exposure to alpha particles from inhaled plutonium is examined. It is found that there is no evidence that exposure to plutonium aerosols significantly affects the risk associated with external exposure. While the Mayak external dose risk estimate of an excess relative risk of 0.16 per Gy is somewhat lower than an appropriately normalized risk estimate from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the uncertainties in these estimates preclude concluding that the external dose excess relative risks of this group of solid cancers differ in the two cohorts.",Included

3491,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan. Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included

Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included

The results of the examination and monitoring of the personnel at the Siberian Chemical Plant (SChP) and adult population of Seversk are presented. The results of primary examination of the personnel who professionally contact the ionizing radiation (IR) from external sources and incorporated 239Pu showed that clinical symptoms of dysfunction of the immune system manifested themselves with a frequency of 75.30%. Infectious-inflammatory diseases (46.95%) and the combined pathology of infectious and allergic character (20.12%) were the most widespread. The allergic diseases (AD) without manifestations of an infectious component were observed not often (7.62%). The monitoring which was carried out for 10 years revealed a decrease in a percentage of persons with clinical signs of disorders of the immune system up to 60.68% among the personnel at the Chemical-Steel Plant and even more among the whole group of the studied personnel at SChP--49.68% (389 : 783). Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established. Similar dynamics of infectious and infectious and allergic syndromes is revealed when the activity of 239Pu is 40 nCi. AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included

3566,"Projected lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea. BACKGROUND: Timely assessment of cancer risk from current radiation exposure among medical radiation workers can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent excessive occupational radiation exposure. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the lifetime risk of cancers induced by occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers., METHODS: Using estimated organ doses and the RadRAT risk assessment tool, the lifetime cancer risk was estimated among medical radiation workers who were enrolled in the Korean National Dose Registry from 1996 to 2011. Median doses were used for estimating the risk because of the skewed distribution of radiation doses. Realistic representative exposure scenarios in the study population based on sex, job start year, and occupational group were created for calculating the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR)., RESULTS: The mean estimated lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure varied significantly by sex and occupational group. The highest LAR was observed in male and female radiologic technologists who started work in 1991 (264.4/100,000 and 391.2/100,000, respectively). Female workers had a higher risk of radiation-related excess cancer, although they were exposed to lower radiation doses than male workers. The higher LAR among women was attributable primarily to excess breast and thyroid cancer risks. LARs among men were higher than women in most other cancer sites. With respect to organ sites, LAR of colon cancer (44.3/100,000) was the highest in male radiologic technologists, whereas LAR of thyroid cancer (222.0/100,000) was the highest in female radiologic technologists among workers who started radiologic practice in 1991. Thyroid and bladder cancers had the highest LFR among radiologic technologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an assessment of the potential cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers, based on current knowledge about radiation risk. Although the radiation-related risk was small in most cases, it varied widely by sex and occupational group, and the risk would be underestimated due to the use of median, rather than mean, doses. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary to optimize radiation doses and protect medical radiation workers from potential health risks, particularly female radiologic technologists.",Included

3582,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency. Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included
3597,"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning in Single-Dose Total-Body Gamma-Irradiated Rhesus Monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ). In this study, the effects of a potentially lethal radiation exposure on the brain for long-term cognitive sequelae were investigated using Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) adopted from other facilities after analysis of acute radiation response via the Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR) network. Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included

3610,"Histopathologic Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence Associated with Radon Exposure among Ontario Uranium Miners. Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (Ptrend < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.",Included
3614,"Mouse spleen lymphocyte bactericidal and peroxidase activities: enhancement by whole body x-irradiation. A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included

However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

3649,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains. BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included
3653,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation. The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included

The fruit fly Drosophila provides opportunities for genetic analysis of radiation tolerance in insects. A knowledge of stage-specific sensitivity is required to understand the mechanisms and test the existing hypothesis of insect radiation tolerance., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Drosophila melanogaster were irradiated using gamma rays at different life stages. Irradiation doses were chosen to start from 100-2200 Gy with increments of 100 Gy, with a dose rate of 12.5 and 25 Gy/min. The threshold of mortality, LD50 and LD100 1 h post-irradiation was recorded for larvae and adults and 24 h post-irradiation for eggs and after 2-3 days for early and late pupae. Total antioxidant capacity for all the life stages was measured using the phosphomolybdenum method., RESULTS: Twenty-four hours post-irradiation, 100% mortality was recorded for eggs at 1000 Gy. One hour post irradiation 100% mortality was recorded at 1300 Gy for first instar larvae, 1700 Gy for second instar larvae, 1900 Gy for feeding third instar larvae and 2200 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae. Post-irradiation complete failure of emergence (100% mortality) was observed at 130 Gy for early pupae and 1500 Gy for late pupae; 100% mortality was observed at 1500 Gy for adults. The values of LD50 were recorded as 452 Gy for eggs, 1049 Gy for first instar larvae, 1350 Gy for second instar larvae, 1265 Gy for feeding third instar larvae, 1590 Gy for non-feeding third instar larvae, 50 Gy for early pupae, 969 Gy for late pupae, 1228 Gy for adult males and 1250 Gy for adult females., CONCLUSIONS: Early pupae were found to be prone to radiation, whereas the non-feeding third instar larvae were most resistant among all stages. The chromosome number being constant and total antioxidant capacity being nearly constant in all stages, we suggest that high rate of cell division during early pupae makes this stage sensitive to radiation.",Included

Although adrenal scintigraphy with 131I-6 beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NCL-6-131I) was used for the first noninvasive imaging of the adrenal glands, it has the disadvantages.

Successful images were obtained with 185 MBq (5 mCi)-260 MBq (7 mCi) of NCL-6-123I, and optimal time required for the satisfactory scan was 2-3 days after the administration. The estimate radiation dose was reduced by using 185 MBq (5 mCi) of NCL-6-123I instead of 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi) of NCL-6-131I. From the result of this clinical study, NCL-6-123I was preferred for the adrenal scintigraphy.",Excluded
151,"Association between SNPs in defined functional pathways and risk of early or late toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pathways involved in the ROS pathway, DNA repair, or TGFB1 signaling on acute or late normal toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients receiving breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy were examined either for erythema (n = 83), fibrosis (n = 123), or individual radiosensitivity (n = 123). The 17 SNPs analyzed are involved in the ROS pathway (GSTP1, SOD2, NQO1, NOS3, XDH), DNA repair (XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC6, ERCC2, LIG4, ATM) or TGFB signaling (SKIL, EP300, APC, AXIN1, TGFB1). Associations with biological and clinical endpoints were studied for single SNPs but especially for combinations of SNPs assuming that a SNP is either beneficial or deleterious and needs to be weighted., RESULTS: With one exception, no significant association was seen between a single SNP and the three endpoints studied. No significant associations were also observed when applying a multi-SNP model assuming that each SNP was deleterious. In contrast, significant associations were obtained when SNPs were suggested to be either beneficial or deleterious. These associations increased, when each SNP was weighted individually. Detailed analysis revealed that both erythema and individual radiosensitivity especially depend on SNPs affecting DNA repair and TGFB1 signaling, while SNPs in ROS pathway were of minor importance., CONCLUSION: Functional pathways of SNPs may be used to form a risk score allowing to predict acute and late radiation-induced toxicity but also to unravel the underlying biological mechanisms.",Excluded
3372,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma. PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded

Background Osteoporosis responsible for loss of bone strength and vertebral fracture (VF) rates ranged from 0% to 18% have been reported in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Objectives In this study we examined the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) and VF in patients with AS (modified New York criteria), and investigated the associations between BMD or VF and demographic, body composition or disease-related parameters. Methods Skeletal and body composition assessment included dual X-ray Absortiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine, hip and total body and radiographs of the spine. The presence of VF was established by the Genant's semi-quantitative method. Results A total of 79 AS patients, 65 males and 14 females with mean age of 43 and 49 years, respectively and with a mean disease duration of 10 years were included. Mean Z score BMD (SD below the age- and gender-matched mean reference value) were slightly decreased only in male patients, both at lumbar spine and total hip (-0,4 p=0,05; -0,3 p<0,01), while mean total body Z score BMD were positive in both genders (female +1,2 p<0,05; male +0,7 p<0,001), independent of the presence of syndesmophytes. Z score BMD values at both total hip and lumbar spine were directly and significantly (p<0.01) associated with body mass index (BMI, Kg/m2); Z score BMD were significantly correlated with both fat and lean mass (kg), measured by DXA, only at hip sites. Z score BMD were significantly lower in the 36 patients with syndesmophytes and in those (19%) with peripheral joints involvement. Despite reasonably preserved BMD values at least one VF was identified in 31% of males and 14% of females; most VF were located at thoracic-lumbar transition and were mild wedge fractures. The presence of VF was not associated with BMD values (ANOVA) but rather with peripheral joints involvement (chi-square test, p<0.01), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (logistic regression, p<0,01), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (p<0,01). Conclusions In this study we found that BMD is relatively well preserved in AS patients. The total body BMD values above the normal range suggest that the overall bone formation might be somewhat increased despite the propensity to decreased mobility. VF are very common particularly in male AS patients: its occurrence is unrelated with BMD values while it is significantly correlated with clinical parameters of disease activity and functional impairment.",Excluded
52,"Evaluation of safety of porous surface electrodes for STS Retinal prosthesis. Purpose: We have reported that our originally developed retinal prostheses with suprachoroidal-transretinal stimulation (STS) effectively elicited phosphene with current less than 1.0 mA in patients with advanced retinitis pigmentosa (Fujikado, IOVS 2010). Now we have developed a novel porous stimulating electrode (porous electrode) for retinal prostheses for STS system (Terasawa, ARVO 2012). The porous electrode has a large surface area introducing porous surface of the platinum bulk electrode with a femtosecond laser irradiation. To verify their safety, we investigated the threshold current Methods: Ten eyes of 10 pigmented rabbits were used in this study. We created a scleral pocket at the posterior pole of the eye and implanted the stimulating electrode. The stimulating electrode comprised a single-channel porous electrode (diameter, 0.5 mm; height, 0.3 mm). The rabbits were divided into four groups and stimulated with electrical currents of different intensities: 1.0 mA (n = 2), 1.5 mA (n = 3), 2.0 mA (n = 3), and 3.0 mA (n = 2). Continuous biphasic pulses of 0.5 ms/phase were applied at a frequency of 20 Hz for 48 h under general anesthesia. Fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed before and after applying the electrical currents. After the experiment was concluded, the eyes were enucleated and the retinas were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Result(s): In the 1.0 mA and 1.5 mA groups, changes were not observed on fundus photography, FA, OCT, or histological examination. Leakage of fluorescent dye was observed in one of three cases in the 2.0 mA group and in all cases in the 3.0 mA group. Probit analysis of the relationship between retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage and stimulus intensity suggested that 2.1 mA led to an RPE damage incidence rate of 50%. Conclusion(s): These results indicate that the threshold current to induce retinal damage is greater than the current to elicit phosphene in STS. Therefore, the porous electrodes are feasible as stimulating electrodes for STS retinal prostheses.",Excluded
1633,"Computer systems analysis of spaceflight induced changes in left ventricular mass. Circulatory adaptations resulting in postflight orthostasis have frequently been observed in response to space travel. It has been postulated that a decrement in left ventricular mass (LVM) found after microgravity exposure may be the central component in this cardiovascular deconditioning. However, a physiologic mechanism responsible for these changes in the myocardium has not been determined. In this study, we examined the sequential alterations in echocardiographic measured LVM from preflight to landing day and 3 days into the postflight recovery period. In a previous study in returning astronauts we found a comparative 9.1% reduction in postflight LVM that returned to preflight values by the third day of recovery. This data was further evaluated in a systems analysis approach using a well-established advanced computer model of circulatory functioning. The computer model incorporates the physiologic responses to changes in pressures, flows and hydraulics within the circulatory system as affected by gravitational forces. Myocardial muscle progression to atrophy or hypertrophy in reaction to the circulatory load conditions is also included in the model. The integrative computer analysis suggests that these variations in LVM could be explained by simple fluid shifts known to occur during spaceflight and can reverse within a few days after reentry into earth's gravity. According to model predictions, the reductions in LVM found upon exposure to microgravity are a result of a contraction of the myocardial interstitial fluid space secondary to a loss in the plasma volume. This hypothesis was additionally supported by the published ground-based study in which we followed the alterations in LVM and plasma volume in normal subjects in which hypovolemia was induced by simple dehydration. In the hypovolemic state, plasma volume was reduced in these subjects and was significantly correlated with echocardiographic measurements of LVM. Based on these experimental findings and the performance of the computer systems analysis it appears that reductions in LVM observed after spaceflight may be secondary to fluid exchanges produced by common physiologic mechanisms. Reductions in LVM observed after microgravity exposure have been previously postulated to be a central component of spaceflight-induced cardiovascular deconditioning. However, a recent study has demonstrated a return of astronauts' LVM to preflight values by the third day after landing through uncertain mechanisms. A systems analysis approach using computer simulation techniques allows for a dissection of the complex physiologic control processes and a more detailed examination of the phenomena. From the simulation studies and computer analysis it appears that microgravity induced reductions in LVM may be explained by considering physiologic fluid exchanges rather than cardiac muscle atrophy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

1918,"Shifts in broadband power and alpha peak frequency observed during long-term isolation. Prolonged periods of social isolation and spatial confinement do not only represent an issue that needs to be faced by a few astronauts during space missions, but can affect all of us as recently shown during pandemic situations. The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.",Excluded

The study group comprised 105 CBL in 105 patients. 35 consecutive CBL were treated with the Frontier system. The control group of 70 CBL (35 DES, 35 BMS) was pair matched with the former group stratified by the type of CBL (Medina classification) and the reference diameter of the main branch (MB). Clinical, procedural, and quantitative angiographic data (QCA) were obtained in all patients. A follow-up angiography 6 +/- 2-month post-index intervention was performed in 84/105 (80%) patients, clinical 6-month follow-up was available in all patients (100%). All Frontier stent procedures were clinically and angiographically successful. Post-procedural QCA analysis of the MB and the side branches revealed comparable minimal lumen diameters (MLDs) between groups. Moreover, contrast use and radiation exposure were not different between groups. DES use, however, was associated with a significantly lower late lumen (LL) loss in the main and the side branch as compared to the Frontier stent and BMS group. Likewise, MACE rates were lowest in the DES group (6%, P < 0.05 vs. BMS) as compared to the Frontier stent (9%) and the BMS group (16%). The Frontier stent accomplishes treatment of CBL with excellent acute clinical, procedural, and angiographic results. Provisional T-stenting using DES provides superior clinical and angiographic long-term results as compared to BMS and Frontier stents.

3257,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation. The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded
2100,"The effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on cortical inhibition in healthy human subjects. It has been suggested that the therapeutic effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are mediated through changes in cortical inhibition (CI). However, in healthy human subjects the effects of rTMS on CI have been inconsistent. Therefore, this study sought to improve on the methodological limitations of previous studies by exploring several different rTMS-stimulus conditions on inhibition in the human motor cortex. In the first experiment, 12 healthy control subjects were randomly assigned to receive regular 1, 10 or 20 Hz rTMS in a counterbalanced order with sessions separated by at least 1 week. In the second experiment, 10 of these 12 subjects received priming rTMS (600 stimuli at 6 Hz followed by 600 stimuli at 1 Hz). Cortical inhibition was indexed using short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and cortical silent period (CSP). Corticospinal excitability was indexed using motor threshold and MEP amplitude. We found no significant overall change in SICI, although there was a significant correlation between changes in SICI with baseline SICI. Subjects with greater SICI at baseline tended to have reduction in SICI post-rTMS, whereas subjects with less SICI tended to have increase in SICI post-rTMS. There was also a significant lengthening of the CSP with higher stimulation frequencies compared to lower stimulation frequencies.

1536,"Effects of TACE combined with precise RT on p53 gene expression and prognosis of HCC patients. To investigate the effects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with precise radiation therapy (RT) on p53 gene expression and prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 80 patients with unresectable HCC treated in the First People's Hospital of Qinhuangdao from March 2009 to March 2015 were randomly divided into TACE group (n=40) and TACE + RT group (n=40). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the levels of p53 in both groups before and after treatment. The biochemical indexes of liver function [alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)] were detected. Moreover, adverse reactions were compared between the two groups of patients, the short-term therapeutic effect was evaluated, and effects of two treatment methods on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients were detected. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical data between the two groups of patients (P>0.05). The p53 protein levels were significantly downregulated in both treatment methods, and it was decreased more significantly in TACE + RT group than that in TACE group (P<0.05). Compared with those before treatment, AFP and GGT levels in both groups of patients after treatment were decreased, but the levels of ALT were increased (P<0.05), and TACE + RT group had a better curative effect than TACE group (P<0.05). Besides, the incidence rate of adverse reactions in TACE + RT group (37.5%) was obviously lower than that in TACE group (65%) (P<0.05). The number of patients with stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) and disease control rate (DCR) in TACE + RT group were superior to those in TACE group (P<0.05). The 2-year survival rate and median PFS of patients in TACE + RT group were also significantly better than those in TACE group (P<0.05). In conclusion, TACE combined with RT has a better clinical effect than TACE alone in the treatment of HCC.Copyright © 2018, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2802,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent surgically treated acromegaly: comparison with fractionated radiotherapy. OBJECT: The authors tested the assumption that gamma knife radiosurgery is more effective than fractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have undergone unsuccessful resective surgery. Untreated and uncured acromegaly causes illness and death. Acromegalic patients in whom growth hormone and, particularly, insulin-like growth factor I are not normalized must undergo further treatment., METHODS: After unsuccessful operations, 16 patients suffering from recurrent and uncured acromegaly underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (25 Gy to the tumor margin, 50 Gy maximum), the outcome of which was compared with the result obtained in 50 patients who received fractionated radiotherapy (40 Gy). The cumulative distribution functions of the two groups (Kaplan-Meier estimate) differed significantly (p < 0.0001 in the log-rank test of Mantel). The mean time to simultaneous normalization of both parameters was 1.4 years in the group treated with the gamma knife and 7.1 years in the group treated with fractionated radiotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest the use of stereotactic radiosurgery as the preferred treatment for recurrent acromegaly resulting from unsuccessfully resected tumors.",Excluded

In order to estimate the uncertainty of the radiation risk associated with the photon energy in epidemiological studies, photon-fluence-weighted LET values were quantified for photon radiation fields with the target organs and irradiation conditions taken into consideration. The photon fluences giving a unit absorbed dose to the target organ were estimated by using photon energy spectra together with the dose conversion coefficients given in ICRP Publication 116 for the target organs of the colon, bone marrow, stomach, lung, skin and breast with three irradiation geometries. As a result, it was demonstrated that the weighted LET values did not show a clear difference among the photon radiation fields subjected to epidemiological studies, regardless of the target organ and the irradiation geometry.",Excluded
1066,"Defining Radioiodine-Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: Efficacy and Safety of Lenvatinib by Radioiodine-Refractory Criteria in the SELECT Trial. Background: While there is a clear consensus for defining radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC), it is unknown whether these criteria are equally valid for determining when radioiodine (RAI) therapy is no longer beneficial and systemic treatment should be considered. Lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in a Phase 3 trial in RR-DTC (SELECT; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.21 [99% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.31]; p < 0.001). This sub-analysis compared clinical outcomes of lenvatinib-treated patients in SELECT stratified by RR-DTC inclusion criteria. Method(s): In SELECT, patients with measurable RR-DTC and radiologic evidence of disease progression <=13 months prior to study entry were randomized 2:1 to lenvatinib (24 mg/day; 28-day cycle) or placebo. In this analysis, patients were stratified based on the following RR-DTC inclusion criteria: no RAI uptake, disease progression within 12 months of RAI therapy despite RAI avidity at the time of treatment, and extensive (>600 mCi) cumulative RAI exposure. All had disease progression as an inclusion criterion for SELECT. Result(s): Of 392 patients (261 lenvatinib; 131 placebo) enrolled, 275, 235, and 73 patients met the inclusion criteria for no RAI uptake, disease progression despite RAI avidity, and extensive RAI exposure, respectively. There was significant overlap between the patient groups, with 167 (42.6%) patients meeting more than one inclusion criterion. Lenvatinib improved median PFS compared to placebo in all groups (""no RAI uptake"": lenvatinib not quantifiable [NQ; CI 14.8-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.7 months [CI 2.5-5.3]; ""disease progression despite RAI avidity"": lenvatinib 16.5 months [CI 12.8-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.7 months [CI 1.9-5.4]; ""extensive RAI exposure"": lenvatinib 18.7 months [CI 10.7-NQ] vs. placebo, 3.6 months [CI 1.9-5.5]). Objective response rates were 71.8%, 60.0%, and 56.0% for patients with no RAI uptake, disease progression despite RAI avidity, and extensive RAI exposure, respectively. Lenvatinib-related adverse events were similar across groups. Conclusion(s): Comparable efficacy and safety profiles were observed in lenvatinib-treated patients regardless of RR-DTC criteria, possibly because of a large overlap among patients fulfilling each criterion. However, differing definitions for RR-DTC may be equally valid because both lenvatinib and placebo arms exhibited similar PFS outcomes across groups.© Copyright 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

1707,"Role of salvage radiation therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma who failed autologous stem cell transplant. Purpose: To analyze, through chart review, the efficacy of salvage radiation therapy (sRT) for relapsed or progressive Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients who failed autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Patients and Methods: Among 347 patients with recurrent/refractory HL who received ASCT from 1986-2006, 163 had post-ASCT progression or relapse. Of these, 56 received sRT and form the basis of this report. Median age at sRT was 30 years (range, 17-59 years). Disease was confined to lymph nodes in 27 patients, whereas 24 had both nodal and extranodal disease. Salvage radiation therapy alone was given in 34 patients (61%), and sRT plus chemotherapy was given in 22 (39%). Median interval from ASCT to sRT was 0.8 years (range, 0.1-5.6 years). The median dose was 35 Gy (range, 8-40.3 Gy). The sRT technique was extended-field in 14 patients (25%) and involved-field in 42 (75%). Result(s): The median follow-up from sRT was 31.3 months (range, 0.2-205.5 months). Overall response rate was 84% (complete response: 36%; partial response: 48%). The median overall survival was 40.8 months (95% confidence interval, 34.2-56.3 months). The 5-year overall survival was 29% (95% confidence interval, 14%-44%). The 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 16%; the 2-year local PFS was 65%, whereas the 2-year systemic PFS was 17%. The 1-year PFS was higher in patients in whom all diseased sites were irradiated (49%) compared with those in whom only the symptomatic site was treated (22%, P=.07). Among 20 alive patients, 5 were disease free (at 6.4, 6.8, 7.4, 7.9, and 17.1 years). Conclusion(s): For patients with HL who fail ASCT, a selective use of RT provides a durable local control rate of 65% at 2 years and should be considered as part of the standard management plan for the palliation of incurable HL. Occasionally irradiation of truly localized disease can lead to long-term survival. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
38,"Genetic and environmental components of thermal tolerance in the least killifish, Heterandria formosa. Populations of the least killifish, Heterandria formosa are found in a wide variety of habitats, including habitats that differ widely in average temperature and in range of seasonal temperatures. To determine whether this ability to exist in thermally different sites is owing to phenotypic plasticity or to population differentiation I raised fish from a spring site and a pond site under common laboratory conditions. Fish were raised at one of two temperatures during gestation and at one of two temperatures from birth to sexual maturity. Gestation temperature, rearing temperature, population of origin, and gender had complex, interacting effects on critical thermal maximum and minimum at sexual maturity, on offspring survival, and on time to maturity. In particular, the populations were strongly differentiated for offspring survival and time to maturity, although the magnitude of the differences depended on the environment. Females performed better than males when genders differed. H. formosa also exhibit superfetation, the presence of embryos in different developmental stages in the ovary at one time. There have been few comparative studies of interspecific variation in superfetation, and there have been no surveys of population variation in reproductive traits within a superfetating species. In this study I followed seasonal changes in reproductive parameters of four populations of H. formosa for all or part of 4 years. The four populations differed in breeding phenology, level of superfetation, total volume of embryos carried, and brood size. This variation does not correspond to either general habitat similarities among the populations (ponds versus rivers), or to habitat stability. I also discovered that first, females must hold back some same-stage embryos while advancing others and second, that size of females, as measured by standard length, clearly influences the total number of embryos, brood size, and number of embryos carried in each stage. Yet despite this relationship between body size and embryo capacity, brood size is not constrained by space available for late-stage embryos. ProQuest Subject Headings: Ecology, Remote sensing.

3662,"Gender-related significance of time interval between radiotherapy and surgery in hypofractionated preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer patients' survival. Aim and background: An optimal break between radiotherapy (RT) and surgery in short-course of RT (SCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer is not clearly established.The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of the break in the preoperative SCRT and overall treatment time (OTT) for locally advanced rectal cancer patients (whole group and male/female subgroups) on patients overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS). Material(s) and Method(s): 131 patients were treated with SCRT (5 Gy/5 days), followed by surgery 3-53 days later. Break was calculated as the time interval between the end of irradiation to surgery and OTT as time interval from the beginning of RT to surgery. Result(s): Mean break was 21.5 (range 3-53.0) days and mean OTT was 26.5 (range 7-58.0) days. In univariate analysis, a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days were negative prognostic factors for OS for all patients, and particularly for the male patients' subgroup. RFS was non-significantly higher (P = 0.066) for patients treated with a break <=15 days and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.099), irrespectively of patients' sex. Patients treated with a break longer than 15 days and OTT >23 days had non-significantly lower level of MFS than those treated with a shorter break (P = 0.269) and OTT <=23 days (P = 0.498). Conclusion(s): In SCRT, a break in the treatment longer than 15 days, especially in the male patients subgroup, should be avoided, because it negatively affects patients' survival.Copyright © 2016 Greater Poland Cancer Centre.",Excluded

124,"Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer causes prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency. PURPOSE: A worsened anorectal function after chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer is often attributed to radiation damage of the anorectum and pelvic floor. Its impact on pudendal nerve function is unclear. This prospective study evaluated the short-term effect of preoperative combined chemoradiation on anorectal physiologic and pudendal nerve function. METHOD(S): Sixty-six patients (39 men, 27 women) with localized resectable (T3, T4, or N1) rectal cancer were included in the study. All patients received 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m2/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m2/day) concurrently on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin within 6 cm of the anal verge had the anus included in the field of radiotherapy (Group A, n = 26). Patients who had rectal cancer with a distal margin 6 to 12 cm from the anal verge had shielding of the anus during radiotherapy (Group B, n = 40). The Wexner continence score, anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency were assessed at baseline and four weeks after completion of chemoradiation. RESULT(S): The median Wexner score deteriorated significantly (P < 0.0001) from 0 to 2.5 for both Groups A (range, 0-8) and B (range, 0-14). The maximum resting anal pressures were unchanged after chemoradiation. The maximum squeeze anal pressures were reduced (mean = 166.5-157.5 mmHg) after chemoradiation. This change was similar in both Groups A and B. Eighteen patients (Group A = 7, Group B = 11) developed prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency after chemoradiation. These 18 patients similarly had a worsened median Wexner continence score (range, 0-3) and maximum squeeze anal pressures (mean = 165.5-144 mmHg). The results obtained were independent of tumor response to chemoradiation. CONCLUSION(S): Preoperative chemoradiation for rectal cancer carries a significant risk of pudendal neuropathy, which might contribute to the incidence of fecal incontinence after restorative proctectomy for rectal cancer. © The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons 2005.",Excluded
1353,"Radical radiation treatment of invasive and locally advanced bladder carcinoma in elderly patients. A total of 146 patients with invasive or locally advanced carcinoma of the bladder (T2-T4) underwent radiation treatment. A significantly higher complete response rate was observed with doses equal to or above 55 Gy and with doses corresponding to cumulative radiation effect (CRE) values of 1700 radiation effect units (reu) or more. In multivariate analysis, decreasing time from the first diagnosis of bladder carcinoma to radiation treatment and 1 or more transurethral resections was associated with a significant increase in survival; increases in T category and sedimentation rate were negative prognostic factors. Although both radiation dose and CRE levels had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis, an increase in CRE levels alone was associated with a significant increase in survival in multivariate analysis. However, the most important predictor of survival was whether the patient showed a complete local response or not. This study emphasises the importance of treating patients with an adequate radiation dose over a short period of time in order to achieve the maximum radiobiological effect and thereby increase the possibility of cure.",Excluded

Method(s): Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field. Result(s): The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded.

3517,"Clinical outcomes of graves' ophthalmopathy treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy. BACKGROUND: Radiation for Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) has traditionally utilized lateral opposing fields (LOF) or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique. The current study was conducted to report clinical outcomes and therapeutic effects of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in treating GO patients., METHODS: One hundred sixteen patients with GO were treated with IMRT as initial local therapy between July 2010 and August 2013, with a median follow-up of 62 months (range 45-81 months). Radiotherapy dose was 20 Gy in 10 fractions within two to three weeks. The immediate and long-term response to IMRT was evaluated in GO severity score and in each category of symptoms. Acute and long-term complications were recorded to assess its safety., RESULTS: Symptom severity score significantly fell from the start of treatment to 4- or 6- month post-IMRT (P < 0.01). In total, 85 patients (73.3%) experienced improvement of GO symptoms in the first half-year, and only 4 of them (4.7%) suffered recurrence of the GO symptoms during the subsequent follow-ups. Orbital pain, tearing and extraocular muscle dysfunction had the best treatment reaction to IMRT, while proptosis and blurred vision were the most refractory symptoms. Acute complications were slight and self-limited, mainly including intermittent eye redness in 9 patients (7.8%), sideburns hair loss in 19 patients (16.4%), increased milphosis or madarosis in 23 patients (19.8%) and pseudo-progression of GO symptoms in 15 patients (12.9%). For long-term complications, chronic xerophthalmias occurred in 7 patients (6.03%), cataract developed in 2 patients (1.72%), and all were well-managed by medical interventions. Radiation retinopathy and secondary malignancy was not presented in the cohort., CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that IMRT could serve as a viable option in treating GO patients, with a satisfactory symptom control ability, and relatively slight and acceptable post-radiotherapeutic complications.",Excluded

1661,"Short-term Automated Quantification of Radiologic Changes in the Characterization of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Versus Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia and Prediction of Long-term Survival. Purpose: Fibrotic interstitial lung diseases presenting with nonspecific and overlapping radiologic findings may be difficult to diagnose without surgical biopsy. We hypothesized that baseline quantifiable radiologic features and their short-term interval change may be predictive of underlying histologic diagnosis as well as long-term survival in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presenting without honeycombing versus nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Material(s) and Method(s): Forty biopsy-confirmed IPF and 20 biopsy-confirmed NSIP patients with available high-resolution chest computed tomography 4 to 24 months apart were studied. CALIPER software was used for the automated characterization and quantification of radiologic findings. Result(s): IPF subjects were older (66 vs. 48; P<0.0001) with lower diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and higher volumes of baseline reticulation (193 vs. 83 mL; P<0.0001). Over the interval period, compared with NSIP, IPF patients experienced greater functional decline (forced vital capacity, -6.3% vs. -1.7%; P=0.02) and radiologic progression, as noted by greater increase in reticulation volume (24 vs. 1.74 mL; P=0.048), and decrease in normal (-220 vs. -37.7 mL; P=0.045) and total lung volumes (-198 vs. 58.1 mL; P=0.03). Older age, male gender, higher reticulation volumes at baseline, and greater interval decrease in normal lung volumes were predictive of IPF. Both baseline and short-term changes in quantitative radiologic findings were predictive of mortality. Conclusion(s): Baseline quantitative radiologic findings and assessment of short-term disease progression may help characterize underlying IPF versus NSIP in those with difficult to differentiate clinicoradiologic presentations. Our study supports the possible utility of assessing serial quantifiable high-resolution chest computed tomographic findings for disease differentiation in these 2 entities.Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Background: The impact of novel alternative access and valve type on radiation exposure during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to determine the impact of a transarterial approach and prosthesis type on physician and patient exposure to radiation during TAVR. Method(s): This was a prospective study including 140 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR by transfemoral (n = 102) or transcarotid (TC) (n = 38) access at 2 centers. Implanted valves were the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; n = 38) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA; n = 102). The primary endpoint was first operator radiation exposure. The secondary endpoint was patient radiation exposure. Result(s): First operator radiation exposure was 4-fold greater during TC TAVR (P < .001). The use of a self-expanding valve was associated with a longer x-ray time (P = .015) and a 2-fold greater first operator radiation dose (P = .018). Patient radiation dose was not significantly affected by arterial approach (P = .055) or valve type (P = .095). After adjustment for potential confounders, the TC approach remained associated with a 174.8% (95% confidence interval, 80.6-318.3, P < .001) increase in first operator radiation dose, whereas the use of a self-expanding valve no longer influenced the first operator dose (P = .630). Conclusion(s): TC access and the use of a self-expanding valve were associated with a 4- and 2-fold greater first operator radiation exposure during TAVR procedures, respectively. Unlike the arterial approach, the effect of bioprosthesis type on radiation exposure was mainly related to x-ray time and was no longer significant after adjustment.Copyright © 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded

The administration of pre-operative chemotherapy with S-1 and concurrent radiotherapy at a total dose of 30 Gy was clinicopathologically evaluated as a treatment for locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) in the present study. The participants comprised 81 patients with OSCC, consisting of 29 patients with stage II disease, 12 patients with stage III disease and 40 patients with stage IV disease. All patients received a total radiation dose of 30 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy, 5 times a week, for 3 weeks, and the patients were concurrently administered S-1 at a dose of 80-120 mg, twice daily, over 4 consecutive weeks. Radical surgery was performed in all cases at 2-6 weeks subsequent to the end of pre-operative chemoradiotherapy. The most common adverse event was oropharyngeal mucositis, but this was transient in all patients. No severe hematological or non-hematological toxicities were observed. The clinical and histopathological response rates were 70.4 and 75.3%, respectively. Post-operatively, local failure developed in 6 patients (7.4%) and neck failure developed in 2 patients (2.5%). Distant metastases were found in 7 patients (8.6%). The overall survival rate, disease-specific survival rate and locoregional control rate at 5 years were 87.7, 89.9 and 90.6%, respectively. Locoregional recurrence occurred more frequently in patients that demonstrated a poor histopathological response compared with patients that demonstrated a good response (P<0.01). These results indicate that pre-operative S-1 chemotherapy with radiotherapy at a total dose of 30 Gy is feasible and effective for patients with locally advanced OSCC, and that little or no histopathological response may be a risk factor for locoregional recurrence in this treatment.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

Objectives: The prognosis for highly advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains poor, and there is currently no standard treatment. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits of trimodality therapy [chemoradiation plus surgery, (CRT + S)] by evaluating the surgical outcomes of patients with ESCC in Keiyukai Sapporo Hospital, Japan. We assessed the preoperative and postoperative adverse events, treatment effects of preoperative CRT, metastatic diagnosis of the dissected lymph nodes, and survival. Patients and Methods: Between 2012 and 2018, 148 patients with highly advanced ESCC who underwent preoperative CRT + S were analyzed for diagnosis and staging, preoperative complications, clinical and histopathological effects of CRT in the resected specimens, survival rates, and recurrences. Result(s): The grade 3 and higher complications of preoperative CRT were neutropenia in 3 cases and thrombocytopenia in 1 case. Among the postoperative complications, there were 2 cases (1.4%) of direct surgical death, only tracheobronchial bleeding and liver failure. Using the 11th edition of the classification of esophageal cancer by the Japanese Esophageal Society, 60 patients (40.5%) were classified as grade 3 (negative for cancer cells, pathological complete response). However, 20 of them (33.3%) had metastatic tumor cells in the lymph nodes. The overall 5-year survival rate was 58.5%.

Conclusion: The tumor's grade, rather than the tumor's location, was related to the opportunity of preserving laryngeal functions in patients with pyriform sinus cancer. The survival rate decreased significantly with the increase of tumor grade or node grade. Preservation of laryngeal functions is a safe and promising method without compromising the survival rate of patients with pyriform sinus cancer. Objective(s): Surgical resection of pyriform sinus carcinoma has a profound influence on the preservation of laryngeal functions. The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the surgical treatment of pyriform sinus carcinoma in the preservation of laryngeal functions without compromising the survival rate. Method(s): Two hundred and thirty patients with pyriform sinus cancer had been operated from March 1978 to December 2002. Of them, 158 cases had been operated with the preservation of laryngeal functions and 72 cases had been undergone total laryngectomy. In addition, 216 cases had received adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. All cases were followed up for 6-12 months (mean 51 +/- 26) after surgery. The survival rate was calculated on the basis of Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the factors that influenced the survival rate of patients with and without preservation of laryngeal functions were analyzed with the log-rank test. Result(s): Laryngeal functions were preserved completely (speech, respiration, and deglutition) in 70.9% (112/158) cases, and partially (speech and deglutition) in 29.1% (46/158) cases. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 75.4% and 59.0%, respectively, for the group with laryngeal function preservation, and 58.6% and 41.5%, respectively, for the group without preservation. There was no statistically significant difference in the survival rate between the two groups within the follow-up period (p > 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade resulted in a proportional decrease of patients with preservation of laryngeal function (p < 0.05). Increase in the tumor grade (p < 0.05) or node grade (p < 0.05) also led to significant decrease in the survival rate.

Rapid progress in the field of Cardiac CT is fostered by the advances in CT scanner technology as well as multiple clinical trials demonstrating its role in coronary artery disease and other indications like congenital heart disease, pulmonary vein assessment and pre transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The cardiovascular imager today is responsible for delivering diagnostic image quality while striking a balance with optimized radiation dose. Radiation dose is the result of multiple scanner and patient related factors. Achieving a justifiable radiation dose according to the ALARA principle requires an adept understanding of the factors affecting radiation dose. We review different scan factors and their effect on radiation dose and present strategies for radiation dose optimization in cardiac CT.Copyright © 2017 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
287,"Reliability and validity of a telephone questionnaire for estimating lifetime personal sun exposure in epidemiologic studies. Our Australia-wide case-control study of ocular melanoma diagnosed in 1996 to 1997 needed a short telephone interview on sun exposure. We constructed one by examining data from 700 controls ages 40 to 64 years in the Geraldton Skin Cancer Survey in 1988; they had answered a ""whole-of-life"" questionnaire in a face-to-face interview. Sun exposure in their first 4 decade years of age best predicted their lifetime annual average sun exposure, so the shortened questionnaire asked about sun exposure in these 4 decade years only. Retesting 60 participants 1 year later with the whole-of-life questionnaire gave an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.78) for ranked total sun exposure between the two interviews; the intraclass correlation coefficient was higher in men (0.73) than in women (0.54). Correlations were also high between parallel measurements of sun exposure on working days in the decade years and in outdoor occupations throughout life in the telephone interview of the ocular melanoma study (Spearman's R = 0.75) and in another study of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (R = 0.71). Agreement between simultaneous parallel measures of total exposure (nonworking + working day and recreational + occupational exposure) was slightly weaker and of nonworking day and recreational exposure much weaker. Occupational exposure in women was much less strongly correlated with total exposure than it was in men possibly because of their frequently combined work and family roles, which the questionnaires did not try to separate. Research is needed into how this might be done to improve sun exposure measurement in women.",Excluded
2424,"Phase I study of pemetrexed and cisplatin with concurrent high-dose thoracic radiation after induction chemotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Purpose: This is a phase I, escalating-dose trial targeting exclusively patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), investigating pemetrexed and fixed-dose cisplatin concurrently administered with high-dose radiotherapy (RT) after induction chemotherapy (CT). Primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of pemetrexed. Patients and Materials: Patients with unresected stage III NSCLC, planned V20<=35%, and FEV>=1.3L, were treated every 21 days for 2 cycles (pemetrexed 500mg/m2; cisplatin 75mg/m2), followed by 2 cycles of concurrent CT-RT: pemetrexed starting dose was 400mg/m2, escalated up to 800mg/m2 per 100mg/m2 dose level (DL), cisplatin at 75mg/m2 and RT at fixed dose of 66Gy/33 fractions. Result(s): Nine of 10 enrolled patients (age range 46-68 years; 6 men; ECOG PS 0 [6 patients], PS 1 [4]; stage IIIA [1], IIIB [9]; 6 adenocarcinomas, 3 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 large cell carcinoma) were entered on 3 DLs. Dose escalation of pemetrexed was conducted up to 600mg/m2 based on the independent safety monitoring board recommendation. One dose-limiting toxicity occurred at DL3: Grade 4 septic shock. Grade 3 related toxicities: 2 neutropenia at DL3, 2 lymphopenia per DL (3 recurrent), 2 leukopenia (1 recurrent) at DL3, 1 gastric pain (DL3), 1 nausea and 1 recurrent vomiting (DL2). No Grade 3/4 radiation-related toxicities were observed. No toxic death was observed. Disease control rate was 77.7% (1 CR, 4 PR, 2 SD). One-year survival rate was 90%. Conclusion(s): This phase I report of pemetrexed is dedicated to NSCLC with induction therapy and fixed high-dose RT. Pemetrexed at 500mg/m2, concurrently given with cisplatin and RT was well tolerated and appears to be the only third-generation agent that can likely be recommended safely at full dose in future trials with concurrent RT. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1172,"Three- Versus Five-Fraction Regimens of Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Peripheral Early-Stage Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: A Two-Institution Propensity Score-Matched Analysis. We compared the outcomes of 3- versus 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy regimens for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. Analysis was performed on 192 eligible lesions and a propensity score-matched 94 lesion subgroup. There were no statistically significant differences in outcomes between regimens, and both regimens are reasonable treatment options. Purpose(s): To evaluate differences in outcomes of early-stage peripheral non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with either 3- or 5-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) at 2 institutions. Patients and Methods: Patients diagnosed with peripherally located early-stage NSCLC who received either a median dose of 60 Gy (interquartile range [IQR], 60-60, biologically effective dose, 151-151) in 3 fractions or a median dose of 50 Gy (IQR, 50-50, biologically effective dose, 94-94) in 5 fractions were included in this study. All data were retrospectively collected and reviewed in an institutional review board-approved database. Result(s): A total of 192 lesions in 192 patients were identified: 94 received 3-fraction SBRT and 98 received 5-fraction SBRT. Patients in the 5-fraction cohort had significantly smaller tumors (P =.0021). Larger tumor size was associated with worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.40, P =.0013) for all patients. A single grade 3 toxicity was reported in each cohort. A propensity score-matched cohort of 94 patients was constructed with a median follow-up of 29.3 months (IQR, 17.3-44.6) for the 3-fraction cohort and 31.0 months (IQR, 17.0-48.5) for the 5-fraction cohort (P =.84). There were no statistically significant differences between these 2 cohorts in overall survival (P =.33), progression-free survival (P =.40), local failure (P =.86), and nodal or distant failure (P =.57) at 2 years. Conclusion(s): The 3- and 5-fraction SBRT regimens for early-stage peripheral NSCLC had comparable clinical outcomes. Both regimens were well tolerated.

1725,"Chemosterilization of Culex pipiens fatigans Wiedemann by exposure of aquatic stages. I. Sterilization potential of certain aziridinyl compounds. The sterile-male technique has been considered to be a promising tool for the control of mosquito populations. Many chemosterilants are known to sterilize insects effectively in the same way as ionizing radiations. The sterilizing activity of 8 alkylating aziridinyl compounds has been assessed on the tropical house-mosquito, Culex pipiens fatigans Wiedemann. The chemosterilants employed for larval and pupal treatments were apholate, metepa, tepa and 5 diaziridinyl alkoxyphosphine oxides. In general, metepa was least toxic to the various life stages of C. p. fatigans during the treatment. Apholate was toxic only in pupal treatments while tepa was less toxic in pupal treatments and more toxic in larval treatments. Diaziridinyl compounds were moderately toxic in both larval and pupal treatments. The tepa and apholate treatments caused certain structural and moulting abnormalities in pupae and adults and also induced abnormalities in eggs and larvae.Among the polyaziridinyl compounds, non-toxic doses of apholate could produce about 100% sterility with larval treatment. Tepa was inferior to apholate, and metepa was least effective in larval treatment. Among the diaziridinyl compounds, the methyl ester was most promising. For pupal treatment, tepa was more effective than apholate and metepa at non-toxic doses, inducing almost complete sterility. The propyl and isopropyl esters of the diaziridinyl compounds also induced very high sterility in pupal treatments.",Excluded

To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prospective ECG-triggering 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography for evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-two patients (31 males, 11 females, mean age 64 years) underwent cardiac CT and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Patients with a heart rate of <65 beats/min with stable heart rhythm were included in the study sample. We used a prospective ECG-triggering protocol. Luminal narrowing over 50% was considered to be significant according to a modified 17-segment AHA model, using invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the standard of reference. The mean radiation dose was 3.5 mSv +/- 0.3 (range, 3.3-4.2 mSv), and 542 of 549 segments (98.7%) in the 42 patients were diagnostic. In contrast, 119 of 542 segments (22%) were diagnosed as significant by ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and NPV were 95.0, 96.2, 96, 85.8 and 98.8%, respectively. False positive results were affected by densely calcified plaques, whereas false negatives were caused by motion artifact with poor vessel attenuation at the distal segments or near the bifurcation area of the coronary arteries.

2400,"Dynamic hybrid synthesis in the treatment of lumbosacral pathology: Preliminary experience with dto. Introduction: Adult patients suffering from degenerative lumbosacral pathology may present different stages of mechanical alteration of the tripod joint in contiguous levels and in selected cases may be considered for associate a instrumented arthrodesis of unstable segment and systems that aim at restoring the physiological movement of the minor symptomatic instability or to prevent junctional disorders in the presence of risk factors in imaging. After a long experience with the Dynesys in treatment of degenerative instability of lumbar spine authors report their experience and preliminary results of a new hybrid system of dynamic stabilization and fusion which has two solutions with a single online system, the Dynesys system to Optima (DTO Zimmer Spine). Material(s) and Method(s): At the Department of Orthopedic A.S.U.S. Giovanni Battista Molinette of Turin since 3-2008 to 12-2009 17 patients with lumbosacral degenerative pathology were surgically treated, 7 males, 10 females, mean age 51 (35-69). All complained of low back pain (VAS 8) with radicular pain in 9 (VAS 7) and claudicazio in 8, ODI 53 %, in 9 patients imaging showed instability in adjacent segments of lumbar stenosis, in 6 junctional dynamic stenosis results of instrumented L4-L5 fusion, one case with 2degree grade L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had degenerative changes at higher levels, one case of pseudoarthrosis in fusion of L5-S1 isthmic spondylolisthesis had junctional instability. Dynamic synthesis has always included a single proximal segment of the instrumented fusion area which extended distally in S1 in 15 cases, in L5 in 2 cases (L5 sacralised). In 11 cases direct decompression was performed within the stenosis area (3 revisions of previous decompression), in 6 cases with functional stenosis indirect decompression was performed by disc-ligament tension with Dynesys. All patients have worn a lumbar corset for 2 months. One case needed revision surgery for a misplaced screw after 7 days. Result(s): For an average f. up 32 months (43-12), back pain almost improved in all patients a VAS 3 (2-6), 12 % ODI. The neurological impairment resolved in all patients (VAS 1). Patients with spondylolisthesis concerned of pain in the iliac crest donor side and higher back pain for insufficient proximal extension of the dynamic synthesis. Good fusion was observed on the X-ray in all cases of the instrumented area, we have not seen any hardware failure nor pedicular screws mobilisation or periprosthetic osteolysis and junctional disorders. Conclusion(s): The experience is short and requires a longer f. up but good clinical results encourage the application of the system in selected cases, often in young adults. This hybrid synthesis does not lengthen the operative time for ease assembly and provides the benefits of limiting the extent of fusion which is coupled to a dynamic system of proven efficacy on adjacent levels reducing the probability of occurrence of future junctional diseases.",Excluded
2091,"Removal of Antiscatter Grids for Spinal Digital Subtraction Angiography: Dose Reduction without Loss of Diagnostic Value. Background Spinal digital subtraction angiography (DSA) exposes patients and operators to substantial amounts of radiation. Antiscatter grid (ASG) removal is used to decrease radiation exposure but may reduce image quality. Purpose To determine whether ASG removal during spinal DSA in adults reduces radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality and whether dose reduction is related to body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study included adults undergoing spinal DSA between January and December 2016. Each procedure included an additional angiographic acquisition performed twice, once with and once without ASG, either documenting the artery of Adamkiewicz (no pathology group) or the condition leading to the procedure (pathology group). Dose differences between study acquisitions and the influence of BMI were evaluated via paired t test. Two neurointerventionalists blinded to acquisition protocols were asked to independently evaluate a sample of 40 study acquisitions (20 with ASG, 20 without ASG) from 20 randomly selected participants to (a) rate image quality, (b) categorize findings, and (c) determine whether images had been obtained with or without ASG. Percentage agreement on image quality, findings categorization, and ability to correctly identify the acquisition protocol was calculated for both readers. Results Fifty-three participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 51 years +/- 15.2; 32 men) were evaluated. ASG removal reduced the mean dose per acquisition by approximately 33% (mean dose-area product and air kerma decreased from 202 to 135.6 microGy/m2 and from 35.3 to 24 mGy, respectively; P < .001) independently of BMI (P = .3). Both readers evaluated all images (40 of 40) as being of diagnostic quality and correctly categorized findings in 19 of 20 (95%) cases. Overall percentage agreement for correct protocol identification was 60% (12 of 20) for grid-in and 45% (nine of 20) for grid-out images.

771,"Low Intensity laser therapy in patients with burning mouth syndrome: a randomized, placebo-controlled study. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of low intensity laser therapy in patients with Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS). Thirty BMS subjects were randomized into two groups - Laser (LG) and Placebo (CG). Seven patients dropped out, leaving 13 patients in LG and 10 patients in CG. Each patient received 4 irradiations (laser or placebo) twice a week, for two consecutive weeks (blinded to the type of irradiation received). Infrared laser (AsGaAI) irradiations were applied to the affected mucosa in scanning mode, wavelength of 790 nm, output power of 20 mW and fluence of 6 J/cm2. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess the therapeutic effect before and after each irradiation, and at all the control time periods: 7, 14, 30, 60 and 90 days after the last irradiation. One researcher delivered irradiation and another recorded the results. Both researchers were blinded, the first to the results, and the second to the type of radiation applied. The results were categorized according to the percentage of symptom level variation, and showed a statistically better response in LG in only two categories of the control checkpoints (p=0.02; Fisher's Exact Test). According to the protocol used in this study, low intensity laser therapy is as beneficial to patients with BMS as placebo treatment, indicating a great emotional component of involvement in BMS symptomatology. Nevertheless, there were positive results in some statistical analyses, thus encouraging further research in BMS laser therapy with other irradiation parameters.",Excluded
1401,"Pathogen reduction by ultraviolet C light effectively inactivates human white blood cells in platelet products. BACKGROUND: Residual white blood cells (WBCs) in cellular blood components induce a variety of adverse immune events, including nonhemolytic febrile transfusion reactions, alloimmunization to HLA antigens, and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Pathogen reduction (PR) methods such as the ultraviolet C (UVC) light-based THERAFLEX UV-Platelets system were developed to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection. As UVC light targets nucleic acids, it interferes with the replication of both pathogens and WBCs. This preclinical study aimed to evaluate the ability of UVC light to inactivate contaminating WBCs in platelet concentrates (PCs)., STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The in vitro and in vivo function of WBCs from UVC-treated PCs was compared to that of WBCs from gamma-irradiated and untreated PCs by measuring cell viability, proliferation, cytokine secretion, antigen presentation in vitro, and xenogeneic GVHD responses in a humanized mouse model., RESULTS: UVC light was at least as effective as gamma irradiation in preventing GVHD in the mouse model. It was more effective in suppressing T-cell proliferation (>5-log reduction in the limiting dilution assay), cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation than gamma irradiation., CONCLUSIONS: The THERAFLEX UV-Platelets (MacoPharma) PR system can substitute gamma irradiation for TA-GVHD prophylaxis in platelet (PLT) transfusion. Moreover, UVC treatment achieves suppression of antigen presentation and inhibition of cytokine accumulation during storage of PCs, which has potential benefits for transfusion recipients.

Several studies suggest that dietary supplementation with antioxidant can influence the response to chemotherapy as well as the development of adverse side effects caused by treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. Using CBA mouse model, we investigated a clinically potential use of a water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP) in the treatment of various cytopenias induced by radiation and/or chemotherapy. Also, the antimetastatic efficiency of WSDP given intraperitoneally alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents and their effects on the blood leukocytes count as well as on hematopoiesis were studied. Tumor was a transplantable mammary carcinoma (MCa) of CBA mouse. Metastases in the lung were generated by injecting viable tumor cells intravenously (iv). WSDP (50 or 150 mg/kg) exerted a significant antimetastatic effect (P < 0.001) when given either before or after tumor cell inoculation. In combined treatment WSDP and Epirubicin profoundly inhibited metastasis formation; this synergistic effect is maximal when Epirubicin and WSDP were administrated after tumor cell inoculation. Positive outcome of combined treatment with WSDP and Epirubicin was also found regarding the number of red and white blood cells in peripheral blood while in mice treated with Epirubicin alone the significant drop in all hematological parameters was noticed on day 13 after tumor cell inoculation. Furthermore, when WSDP (50 mg/kg) was given perorally (po) for 20 consecutive days an increased number of exogenous CFUs was found in treated mice. WSDP given either for 20 or 40 days increased cellularity of hematopoietic tissue and the number of leucocytes in peripheral blood; prolonged treatment with WSDP also elevated myeloid and megakaryocytic types of CFUs. To conclude, these findings indicate that the combination of WSDP with chemotherapeutics could increase the antimetastatic potential of chemotherapeutic agents; these findings suggest the benefits of potential clinical trials using WSDP combined with chemotherapeutic agents in order to maximize their antitumor activity and minimize postchemotherapeutic or radiotherapeutic deteriorated reactions.",Excluded

3320,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study. Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
3198,"Randomized phase II study of temozolomide and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme. Purpose: Surgery remains the standard treatment for glioma, followed by radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy. Despite multidisciplinary approaches, the median survival time for patients with glioblastoma multiform (GBM) remains at less than 1 year from initial diagnosis. Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, has shown promising activity in the treatment of malignant gliomas. We conducted a multicenter randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy and safety of TMZ administered concomitantly and sequentially to RT versus RT alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Patients and Methods: One hundred thirty patients with pathologically confirmed, newly diagnosed GBM were randomly assigned (110 assessable patients) to receive either TMZ 75 mg/m2/d orally, concomitantly with RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group A, n = 57), followed by six cycles of TMZ (150 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5 and 15 to 19 every 28 days), or RT alone (60 Gy in 30 fractions; group B, n = 53). Result(s): Median time to progression was 10.8 months in group A and 5.2 months in group B (P = .0001). One-year progression-free survival rate was 36.6% in group A and 7.7% in group B. Median overall survival (OS) time was also significantly better in group A versus group B (13.4 v 7.7 months, respectively; P < .0001), as was the 1-year OS at 56.3% v 15.7% (P < .0001), respectively. Toxicity was mainly hematologic. One patient with grade 4 myelotoxicity died as a result of sepsis. The other side effects were mild.

3468,"A hypothetical protocol for the provisional use of perfusion imaging with exercise stress testing. Background: Previous literature suggests that the results of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) add little to the prognosis of patients who exercise >10 metabolic equivalents (METS) during stress testing. With this in mind, we attempted to determine if a provisional injection protocol could be developed in which a patient would not receive an injection of radioisotope if adequate exercise was achieved without symptoms and a negative ECG response. This protocol would save a substantial amount of time, radiation exposure, and cost. Method(s): All patients who underwent a stress SPECT MPI over a 6.5-year period from 2004 to 2010 were included. Patients who would have been considered for a standby injection protocol were: exercise stress, age < 65, no known coronary artery disease (CAD), and an interpretable ECG. Patients were retrospectively divided into two groups based on whether they would have received radioisotope or not. Criteria for not injecting included a maximal predicted heart rate >= 85%, >=10 METS of exercise, no symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath, and no ECG changes (ST depression or arrhythmia). The two groups were then compared based on MPI results and all-cause mortality derived from the Social Security Death Index. Result(s): A total of 24,689 patients underwent SPECT MPI during this period, and 5,352 would have been eligible for a provisional injection protocol. There were 3,791 (70.8%), who would have been injected and 1,561 (29.2%), who would not have been. Perfusion results were abnormal in 5.9% of non-injected group compared to 14.4% in those who would have been injected. After a mean follow-up of 60.6 +/- 21.4 months, 1.1% had died in the non-injected cohort compared to 2.2% in the injected group. Conclusion(s): A provisional injection protocol defined as age < 65, normal rest ECG, no history of CAD, and high level exercise with a negative ECG response and no symptoms has a very low 5-year all-cause mortality and low yield of MPI.

Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is one of the common late adverse effects that follow radiation therapy for head and neck cancers. ORN usually develops on the mandible and less frequently on the maxilla. We present three cases of ORN of the cervical vertebrae, which is rarely reported. Two patients suffered from secondary osteomyelitis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy with a hyperfractionated and an accelerated hyperfractionated regimen, respectively. For these patients, the high intensity of treatment was considered the cause of ORN. The third patient underwent concurrent chemoradiation therapy for upper thoracic esophageal cancer and subsequently underwent endoscopic laser resection and radiation therapy for hypopharyngeal cancer. ORN developed in the area of reirradiation. In this case, an excessive radiation dose was considered the cause. ORN of cervical vertebrae, different from that of the mandible and maxilla, has a risk of radiculopathy and myelopathy. In the future, ORN of cervical vertebrae will increase because metachronous double cancers will increase and opportunities for reirradiation, in turn, will increase. To prevent this, it is necessary to optimize the treatment schedule for radiation therapy, including the total dose, fractionation, and concurrent chemotherapy, and to decrease the volume of cervical vertebrae within the irradiation field. © 2010 Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
2766,"Low frequency rTMS over posterior parietal cortex impairs smooth pursuit eye tracking. The role of the posterior parietal cortex in smooth pursuit eye movements remains unclear. We used low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to study the cognitive and neural systems involved in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements. Eighteen participants were tested on two separate occasions. On each occasion we measured smooth pursuit eye tracking before and after 6 min of 1 Hz rTMS delivered at 90% of motor threshold. Low frequency rTMS over the posterior parietal cortex led to a significant reduction in smooth pursuit velocity gain, whereas rTMS over the motor cortex had no effect on gain. We conclude that low frequency offline rTMS is a potentially useful tool with which to explore the cortical systems involved in oculomotor control.",Excluded
806,"Long-term survival and symptom palliation in small primary bronchial carcinomas following treatment with intraluminal radiotherapy alone. Between April 1988 and December 1992, 37 patients with small, previously unirradiated, primary non-small cell carcinomas of the bronchus causing symptoms due to endobronchial disease were treated at the Christie Hospital, Manchester, with a single fraction of high dose rate intraluminal radiotherapy (ILT) using the microSelectron-HDR machine. Small primary (SP) lesions were defined as being less than 2 cm in diameter in a direction perpendicular to the central axis of the iridium-192 treatment source. Fifteen patients (41%) were treated to a dose of 15 Gy and 22 patients (59%) to 20 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the central axis of the source. At 6 weeks following ILT, improvement in symptoms was seen in the following percentages of patients: haemoptysis 96%, pulmonary collapse 69%, cough 55% and dyspnoea 52%. The magnitude of improvement in these symptoms was largely maintained in patients surviving to 4 months and then 12 months post-ILT. Median actuarial survival was 709 days, 2-year survival 49.4% and 5-year survival 14.1%. Overall, there was no significant difference in survival after treatment with 20 Gy compared with 15 Gy at 1 cm. At the close of study, there were four patients still alive without disease recurrence with survivals of 38, 48, 49 and 63 months. All had had biopsy-proven squamous cell carcinomas and all had been treated with 20 Gy at 1 cm. Five patients died from massive haemoptysis as a terminal event at 4, 9, 9, 10 and 11 months post-ILT, well below the median survival for this group of patients. Again, all had been treated with 20 Gy as opposed to 15 Gy at 1 cm. Over the same time period, 287 patients with non-small cell carcinomas of more than 2 cm in diameter (large primary lesions, LP), were treated with a single fraction of ILT only, as their initial treatment. A consistently greater percentage of patients with SP lesions showed an improvement in the symptoms of haemoptysis and pulmonary collapse when compared with patients with LP lesions. Patients with LP lesions demonstrated a decreased actuarial survival when compared with SP lesions, with median survival being 156 days, 2-year survival 3.1% and no survivors beyond 39 months. This study demonstrates that, in patients with small endobronchial carcinomas a single fraction of ILT can give efficient palliation of symptoms and lead to long term disease-free survival, but that a dose of 20 Gy may be at the limit of bronchial radiation tolerance for a single dose technique employing a high dose rate source.",Excluded
2234,"Computed tomography indicators of cerebral microperfusion improve long term after carotid stenting in symptomatic patients. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that computed tomography (CT) perfusion markers of cerebral microcirculation would improve 36 months after internal carotid artery stenting for symptomatic carotid stenosis while results obtained 6-8 weeks after the stenting procedure would yield a predictive value. METHOD(S): We recruited consecutive eligible patients with >70% symptomatic carotid stenosis with a complete circle of Willis and normal vertebral arteries to the observational cohort study. We detected changes in the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP) and permeability surface area-product (PS) before and after carotid stenting. We have also compared the absolute differences in the ipsilateral and contralateral CT perfusion markers before and after stenting. The search for regression models of ""36 months after stenting"" results was based on a stepwise analysis with bidirectional elimination method. RESULT(S): A total of 34 patients completed the 36 months follow-up (15 females, mean age of 69.68+/-S.D. 7.61 years). At 36 months after stenting, the absolute values for CT perfusion markers had improved: CBF (ipsilateral: +7.76%, contralateral: +0.95%); CBV (ipsilateral: +5.13%, contralateral: +3.00%); MTT (ipsilateral: -12.90%; contralateral: -5.63%); TTP (ipsilateral: -2.10%, contralateral: -4.73%) and PS (ipsilateral: -35.21%, contralateral: -35.45%). MTT assessed 6-8 weeks after stenting predicted the MTT value 36 months after stenting (ipsilateral: R2=0.867, contralateral R2=0.688). CONCLUSION(S): We have demonstrated improvements in CT perfusion markers of cerebral microcirculation health that persist for at least 3 years after carotid artery stenting in symptomatic patients.

1224,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer. Late results of a pilot study. BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has recently been proven that postoperative radiotherapy combined with fluorouracil showed an increase of survival and local control in patients with rectal cancer. However, hematological and intestinal toxicity also increased. Experimental and clinical studies showed an increased radiation effect with an acceptable toxicity by delivering drug via a continuous intravenous infusion., METHODOLOGY: From 1988 to 1998, 80 patients radically operated on for stages B2-C rectal cancer were irradiated with 3 fractions of 100 cGy per day to a total dose of 5,600 cGy. 34 out of these 80 patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy alone and 46 received radiotherapy combined with concomitant protracted infusion of fluorouracil at doses of 250 mg/m2 per day., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 59% and 54%, respectively, in the combined modality group, as compared to 42% and 34%, respectively, in the radiation alone group. The differences were not significant, but the incidence of local relapse and patients' survival showed a better trend for combined approach., CONCLUSIONS: The data from international literature are in favor of a combined approach, both in preoperative and postoperative treatment of advanced rectal cancer. Adjuvant therapy must be re-evaluated in trials using total mesorectal excision as the standard operative technique.",Excluded
2564,"Role of Angiogenesis in Chronic Radiation Proctitis: New Evidence Favoring Inhibition of Angiogenesis Ex Vivo. Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP), a common complication after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies, compromises patient quality of life. Vascular damage and aberrant angiogenesis in the mucosal layer are essential histological features, but changes to the submucosal layer are unclear. Thus, we evaluated the histological characteristics and distribution changes of key angiogenic factors in full-layered human CRP samples. Method(s): Thirty paraffin-embedded CRP and twenty-nine non-CRP tissues were used to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody was performed to calculate microvascular density (MVD). Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

1852,"Effective time window in reducing pituitary adenoma size by gamma knife radiosurgery. Objectives: Although the effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in controlling the size of pituitary adenomas has been well demonstrated in many studies, the time period in which significant changes in tumor size occurs has been investigated in a limited fashion. It is important to determine the therapeutic window of GKRS in treating pituitary adenomas, i.e., the effective timeframe during which significant size reduction of these tumors occurs, so that alternative treatments such as further GKRS or microsurgery might be prescribed in a timely manner if clinically indicated. Method(s): This was a nested sample of an ongoing local cohort study on GKRS for pituitary adenomas at the University of Virginia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using dedicated sequences was employed. Only patients with a baseline MRI (TP0) and at least 1 follow-up study performed in the University Hospital after GKRS were included. The follow-up scans were performed at five time-points (TP1-TP5) which were 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after GKRS. The dimensional indices of the tumors were measured in three orthogonal planes, i.e., transverse (TR), antero-posterior (AP) and cranio-caudal (CC). The volumes of the tumors were estimated by using the following formula: $${\text{V}} = \pi\,({\text{TR}} \times {\text{AP}} \times {\text{CC}})/6$$V=pi(TRxAPxCC)/6. Tumor volume decrease by more than 25 % from baseline was considered as 'shrinkage', <25 % tumor size increase or decrease was considered 'static', and more than 25 % increase as 'increment'. Our cohort consisted of 21 patients, with functioning adenomas in 13 subjects i.e. six adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-secreting and seven growth hormone (GH)-secreting, and non-functioning (NF) adenomas in eight subjects. Result(s): In 26 adenomas (8 ACTH, 9 GH and 9 NF), tumor control (tumor shrinkage or static) were achieved in 21 tumors (80.8 %); 89, 75, and 78 % for GH-secreting, ACTH-secreting and NF adenomas respectively, at the end of the 4-year follow-up period. Analysis of variance showed significant differences of GKRS margin dose among different types of tumors (p = 0.013), but not of baseline tumor volumes (p = 0.240). Logistic regression analysis showed no significant association of margin dose, baseline volume or tumor type with the tumor control outcome. Comparison of tumor change using dimensional indices relative to the base time point (TP0) showed that in the sample there was an average reduction of 1.290 mm at TP1 (6 months) with p values 0.155 (parametric t test) and 0.098 (non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-ranked test) respectively, showing a moderate reduction in tumor dimensional indices. The change in dimensional indices at later time points (TP2-TP5) showed an average reduction ranging from 1.930 to 2.471 mm. Significant reduction in the mean dimensional indices was firstly observed at TP2 (1 year) with p values 0.013 (t test) and 0.018 (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Such scale of reduction in the dimensional indices appeared to be maintained along the time axis (from TP2 to TP5). Conclusion(s): Significant decrease in tumor dimensional indices tended to occur at 1 year post-GKRS. Although to a lesser extent, such decrease in dimensional indices continued up to the end of our follow-up period.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: In the emergency department, fish and chicken bone impactions are typically evaluated with screening x-rays. We sought to determine whether this modality ultimately improves system outcomes, including length of stay (LOS), cost, and radiation dosage., METHODS: We reviewed patients >= 18 years old presenting to an urban academic emergency department over a 4-year period who received a screening soft-tissue x-ray to determine the presence of a retained fish or chicken bone. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of x-ray and computed tomography (CT) evaluations, respectively, in addition to system outcomes., RESULTS: Twenty-seven of the 78 patients included for analysis were ultimately positive for bone impaction. Initial x-ray interpretations demonstrated a sensitivity of 24.0% (95% CI, 9.4%-45.1%) and a specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 78.2%-96.7%). However, initial CT interpretation (ie, a preliminary read from on-call residents) demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 19.4%-99.4%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59.0%-100%). LOS, cost, and radiation dosage were not significantly different between patients who ultimately had true bone impactions and those who did not (P > .05)., CONCLUSIONS: X-rays are poor screening tools in determining fish or chicken bone impactions with poor diagnostic and system utility.

733,"[Topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. Protection against increased expression of interstital collagenase and reduced collagen-I expression after single exposure to UVA irradiation]. Photoaged skin is characterized by a decrease of dermal collagen fibers, resulting from an increased breakdown and a diminished de novo synthesis. The increased breakdown results from an increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The main building blocks involved in de novo synthesis of collagen fibers are collagen 1A1 and 1A2, the expression of which is reduced in photoaged skin. We studied the effect of topical application of vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides on UV-induced up-regulation of the expression of MMP-1 and on UV-induced down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2. The study was conducted with 10 subjects with healthy skin who were comparatively treated for 10 days with (i) a basic preparation containing jojoba oil, (ii) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, (iii) the basic preparation supplemented with phytosterols and ceramides, and (iv) the basic preparation supplemented with vitamins, phytosterols and ceramides. All four preparations inhibited the UV induced up-regulation of MMP-1. Neither the basic product nor that supplemented with vitamins inhibited down-regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2, but addition of phytosterols and ceramides caused a decreased down-regulation of the expression of these genes. Our results indicate that phytosterols and ceramides are effective in blocking the reduced collagen synthesis after UV irradiation and even stimulating synthesis. They may be useful additions to anti-aging products.",Excluded
1403,"Life on mars from a Self-Determination Theory perspective: How astronauts' needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness go hand in hand with crew health and mission success - Results from HI-SEAS IV. With the advent of long-duration interplanetary space missions, astronauts face new psychological challenges never observed before. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory, the objective of the present research was to study how astronauts' basic psychological needs relate to astronaut well-being and mission success, and how Mission Support could foster astronaut need satisfaction. Specifically, we examined how weekly ups and downs in astronauts' need for autonomy, competence and relatedness related to week-to-week fluctuations in a set of positive (i.e., self-endorsed motivation to follow operating procedures, cooperation with Mission Support members, happiness and performance) and negative outcomes (i.e., oppositional defiance towards operating procedures, irritation with Mission Support members and stress) during the Mars simulation HI-SEAS mission 4. Additionally, we examined whether variations in astronauts' needs could be predicted by variations in Mission Support's communication style in interacting with the crew. The study comprised six volunteers, three women and three men, between 25 and 36 years of age (M = 30, SD = 4). The HI-SEAS IV mission simulated a yearlong stay on Mars. During the simulation, measures of autonomy, competence, relatedness with crewmembers and loved-ones at home, well-being, motivation, crew-ground interactions and performance were taken on a weekly basis. The data were analyzed using multilevel analyses. Overall, results indicated significant decreases in the experiences of autonomy as well as relatedness with both crewmembers and loved-ones at home, which aggravated as the mission progressed. Weekly experiences of all three need satisfactions, but in particular autonomy and relatedness with fellow crewmembers, were found to relate positively to weekly variations in self-endorsed motivation, cooperation, happiness and performance, and negatively to weekly variations in oppositional defiance, irritation, and stress. Moreover, week-to-week fluctuations in an autonomy-supportive communication style from Mission Support were found to relate positively, and a controlling style negatively, to weekly fluctuations in the crew's experience of autonomy, competence, and relatedness with crewmembers. Implications for future studies and human spaceflight are discussed. 2019 IAA",Excluded

Purpose: To determine whether an iterative reconstruction (IR) technique (iDose, Philips Healthcare) can reduce image noise and improve image quality in obese patients undergoing computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA). Material(s) and Method(s): The study was Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant and approved by our institutional review board. A total of 33 obese patients (average body mass index: 42.7) underwent CTPA studies following standard departmental protocols. The data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and 3 iDose strengths (iDoseL1, iDoseL3, and iDoseL5) for a total of 132 studies. FBP data were collected from 33 controls (average body mass index: 22) undergoing CTPA. Regions of interest were drawn at 6 identical levels in the pulmonary artery (PA), from the main PA to a subsegmental branch, in both the control group and study groups using each algorithm. Noise and attenuation were measured at all PA levels. Three thoracic radiologists graded each study on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (ideal) by 4 categories: image quality, noise, PA enhancement, and ""plastic"" appearance. Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test, 1-way analysis of variance, and linear weighted kappa. Result(s): Compared with the control group, there was significantly higher noise with FBP, iDoseL1, and iDoseL3 algorithms (P<0.001) in the study group. There was no significant difference between the noise in the control group and iDoseL5 algorithm in the study group. Analysis within the study group showed a significant and progressive decrease in noise and increase in the contrast-to-noise ratio as the level of IR was increased (P<0.001). Compared with FBP, readers graded overall image quality as being higher using iDoseL1 (P=0.0018), iDoseL3 (P<0.001), and iDoseL5 (P<0.001). Compared with FBP, there was subjective improvement in image noise and PA enhancement with increasing levels of iDose.

PURPOSE: Prevalence of skin cancer is rapidly increasing. There is a need for non-invasive biomarkers to assess efficacy of prevention strategies aiming at reduction of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Recently, stratum corneum (SC) biomarkers were applied in various inflammatory skin diseases. Here, we explore their suitability as candidate biomarkers for UVR., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve volunteers were exposed to a UVB-dose of 0.72 SED, three times a week, during three weeks. As candidate biomarkers, cis-isomers of urocanic acid (cUCA) and 25 immunological mediators were measured in the SC., RESULTS: Eight immunological markers significantly changed from baseline. Of them, IL-1RA/IL-1alpha and a placental growth factor (PIGF) showed gradual changes during UVR-exposure (p < 0.01 for linear trend). cUCA increased sharply already after the first exposure, however, reached a plateau in the second week., CONCLUSIONS: SC represents a promising, non-invasive alternative to skin biopsy in detecting UVR-induced changes. cUCA is the marker of choice for assessment of single UVR-exposure; however, it is less suitable for cumulative UVR-dose. Immunological markers including IL-1RA/IL-1alpha and PIGF showed gradual changes, and therefore are convenient for monitoring chronic UVR-exposure. These candidate biomarkers might facilitate assessment of the efficacy of preventive measures in the workplace and general population.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The intrahepatic recurrence rate after curative hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is high, and management of recurrence is thus important for long-term survival. The use of radiation therapy has been relatively uncommon in the treatment of recurrent HCC., METHODS: Eight patients underwent radiation therapy for recurrent HCC 12-98 months after hepatectomy. Five of them were treated with protons (250 MeV; 68.8-84.5 Gy), and three were treated with X-rays (6 MV; 60 or 70 Gy). One patient received radiation therapy twice for another lesion with a 79-month interval. The target tumors were 1.2-4.5 cm. All patients also underwent transcatheter arterial embolization or other regional therapy., RESULTS: Although transient ascites was found in three patients after radiation therapy, no patient died as a result of the irradiation. Seven patients died 9 months to 4 years (median 1 year 6 months) after radiation therapy. Re-recurrence was observed in the irradiated liver in two patients (local control 78%). Four patients died of lung metastasis after radiation therapy. The median survival time was 3 years 3 months (range 1 year 1 month to 8 years 6 months) after recurrence., CONCLUSION: Multimodality therapy is necessary for the management of recurrence. Radiation therapy could be beneficial when other therapies present some difficulty regarding application or are performed incompletely. It must be emphasized that radiation therapy should be considered in addition to other regional therapies for the treatment of recurrent or re-recurrent HCC, and that radiation therapy can be repeated in selected patients.",Excluded
1795,"A novel method of continuous cage-side monitoring of hyperthyroid cats treated with radio-iodine. A continuous monitoring system (MGP DM2000X) was assessed for monitoring gamma radiation emissions and determining appropriate isolation times for hyperthyroid cats treated with radioactive iodine (I(131)). Daily radiation emitted by 12 cats who had received a range of doses of I(131) (80-200 MBq) was measured and average background radiation readings deducted. The effective half-lives of the I(131) in the cats were found to have a median of 2.54 days (range 1.40-3.24 days). Cats treated with 200 MBq emitted 5 microGy/day more exposure than cats treated with lower doses throughout the study period (P=0.032). All cats were found to emit a total radiation dose exposure less than 100 microGy (range 0-43 microGy) during days 18-21 of isolation. The potential additional dose exposure to owners was calculated at various days that might be considered for the cats to be returned to their owners. Using this provisional data, maximum isolation periods at this institution could be safely reduced to 17 days as long as certain precautions are followed. This preliminary study demonstrated that this novel cage-side monitoring system can be used to calculate the effective half-life of I(131) and to measure gamma radiation exposure from treated cats, which may assist other institutions in determining appropriate isolation times for individual cats.Copyright British Veterinary Association.",Excluded
2106,"A novel screw guiding method with a screw guide template system for posterior C-2 fixation: Clinical article. Object. Accurate insertion of C-2 cervical screws is imperative; however, the procedures for C-2 screw insertion are technically demanding and challenging, especially in cases of C-2 vertebral abnormality. The purpose of this study is to report the effectiveness of the tailor-made screw guide template (SGT) system for placement of C-2 screws, including in cases with abnormalities. Methods. Twenty-three patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion surgery with C-2 cervical screw insertion using the SGT system were included. The preoperative bone image on CT was analyzed using multiplanar imaging software. The trajectory and depth of the screws were designed based on these images, and transparent templates with screw guiding cylinders were created for each lamina. During the operation, after templates were engaged directly to the laminae, drilling, tapping, and screwing were performed through the templates. The authors placed 26 pedicle screws, 12 pars screws, 6 laminar screws, and 4 C1-2 transarticular screws using the SGT system. To assess the accuracy of the screw track under this system, the deviation of the screw axis from the preplanned trajectory was evaluated on postoperative CT and was classified as follows: Class 1 (accurate), a screw axis deviation less than 2 mm from the planned trajectory; Class 2 (inaccurate), 2 mm or more but less than 4 mm; and Class 3 (deviated), 4 mm or more. In addition, to assess the safety of the screw insertion, malpositioning of the screws was also evaluated using the following grading system: Grade 0 (containing), a screw is completely within the wall of the bone structure; Grade 1 (exposure), a screw perforates the wall of the bone structure but more than 50% of the screw diameter remains within the bone; Grade 2 (perforation), a screw perforates the bone structures and more than 50% of the screw diameter is outside the pedicle; and Grade 3 (penetration), a screw perforates completely outside the bone structure. Results. In total, 47 (97.9%) of 48 screws were classified into Class 1 and Grade 0, whereas 1 laminar screw was classified as Class 3 and Grade 2. Mean screw deviations were 0.36 mm in the axial plane (range 0.0-3.8 mm) and 0.30 mm in the sagittal plane (range 0.0-0.8 mm). Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the SGT system provided extremely accurate C-2 cervical screw insertion without configuration of reference points, high-dose radiation from intraoperative 3D navigation, or any registration or probing error evoked by changes in spinal alignment during surgery. A multistep screw placement technique and reliable screw guide cylinders were the key to accurate screw placement using the SGT system. ©AANS, 2014.",Excluded
72,"The outcome of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated with R-CHOP is not predicted by interim evaluation of 18-FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET). Background: In DLBCL patients PET evaluation has a defined role to assess the final response, but the predictive value of interim PET is contradictory. Standardized criteria of interpretation of Interim PET have not been well established yet and the visual analysis of PET results by dichotomous evaluation as positive or negative is difficult to apply. Aim of study. to determine the predictive value of interim (I-PET) and final PET (F-PET) on Progression Free Survival (PFS) in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP. Patients and Methods: From April 2004 to December 2008, 82 newly diagnosed DLBCL patients treated in five Hematology Departments were included. Clinical features were as follows: median age 56 years (19-81); 42 males and 40 females, 29 stage I-II and 53 stage III-IV; 47 L/LI and 35 I/IH IPI score. All patients were treated according to the planned therapy, not modified by I-PET results, with 6-8 RCHOP. IF-RT was planned to areas of bulky disease and given to 13 patients. All patients had PET scan performed at the diagnosis, during treatment (I-PET) and at the end of therapy (F-PET). All PET results were centrally reviewed and defined as positive or negative by visual dichotomous response criteria according to the First Consensus Conference (Deauville 2009). Result(s): All patients were evaluable for response. I-PET was performed after two R-CHOP in 46 pts, after three in 13 and after four in 23. At the end of therapy 73 pts (89%) achieved a CR and nine (11%) were non responders. Fifty-five patients (67%) were negative and 27 (33%) positive at the I-PET; 69 pts (84%) were negative and 13 (16%) positive at the F-PET. 15/27 (56%) I-PET positive patients became F-PET negative at the end of the therapy. The concordance between clinical CR and F-PET negativity was 99%: one CR pt was false F-PET positive due to parothid carcinoma. The prognostic impact of PET results on the outcome was evaluated. With a median FU of 18 months, Progression-free survival (PFS) was 80%. PFS did not correlate with I-PET results, 18-months PFS rates were: 84% in I-PET negative patients and 74%in I-PET positive patients (p.198) (Figure 1A). Conversely F-PET strongly predicted PFS (p.015): 84% in F-PET negative patients and 61% in F-PET positive patients. (Figure 1B). A further analysis for progression was performed to adjust the effect of I-PET analysis for other known risk factors (age >=60, stage, PS, IPI, LDH, bulky, number of extranodal sites, Bone Marrow involvement): only LDH (p.005) and IPI 0-2 vs. 3-5 (p.001) were confirmed as independent predictors for progression. The use of G-CSF during treatment did not influenced IPET results. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that in DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP a positive interim PET did not predict a worse outcome. Conversely, final PET results strongly correlate with PFS. A longer follow up is necessary to validate our data. Prospective larger studies and standarditation of criteria for interim PET are needed to assess the prognostic value of interim PET in DLBCL patients. (Graph presented).",Excluded
1150,"Clinical and dosimetric factors of radiation-induced esophageal injury: Radiation-induced esophageal toxicity. Aim: To analyze the clinical and dosimetric predictive factors for radiation-induced esophageal injury in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) during three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 208 consecutive patients (146 men and 62 women) with NSCLC treated with 3D-CRT. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range 35-87 years). The clinical and treatment parameters including gender, age, performance status, sequential chemotherapy, concurrent chemotherapy, presence of carinal or subcarinal lymph nodes, pretreatment weight loss, mean dose to the entire esophagus, maximal point dose to the esophagus, and percentage of volume of esophagus receiving >55 Gy were studied. Clinical and dosimetric factors for radiation-induced acute and late grade 3-5 esophageal injury were analyzed according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. Result(s): Twenty-five (12%) of the two hundred and eight patients developed acute or late grade 3-5 esophageal injury. Among them, nine patients had both acute and late grade 3-5 esophageal injury, two died of late esophageal perforation. Concurrent chemotherapy and maximal point dose to the esophagus >=60 Gy were significantly associated with the risk of grade 3-5 esophageal injury. Fifty-four (26%) of the two hundred and eight patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Among them, 25 (46%) developed grade 3-5 esophageal injury (P=0.0001<0.01). However, no grade 3-5 esophageal injury occurred in patients who received a maximal point dose to the esophagus <60 Gy (P=0.0001<0.01). Conclusion(s): Concurrent chemotherapy and the maximal esophageal point dose >=60 Gy are significantly associated with the risk of grade 3-5 esophageal injury in patients with NSCLC treated with 3D-CRT. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

2829,"Effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction on computer-aided detection of pulmonary nodules: Intra-individual comparison. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of radiation dose reduction and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) for pulmonary nodules., METHODS: In this prospective study twenty-five patients were included who were scanned for pulmonary nodule follow-up. Image acquisition was performed at routine dose and three reduced dose levels in a single session by decreasing mAs-values with 45%, 60% and 75%. Tube voltage was fixed at 120 kVp for patients >= 80 kg and 100 kVp for patients < 80 kg. Data were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), iDose(4) (levels 1,4,6) and IMR (levels 1-3). All noncalcified solid pulmonary nodules >= 4 mm identified by two radiologists in consensus served as the reference standard. Subsequently, nodule volume was measured with CAD software and compared to the reference consensus. The numbers of true-positives, false-positives and missed pulmonary nodules were evaluated as well as the sensitivity., RESULTS: Median effective radiation dose was 2.2 mSv at routine dose and 1.2, 0.9 and 0.6 mSv at respectively 45%, 60% and 75% reduced dose. A total of 28 pulmonary nodules were included. With FBP at routine dose, 89% (25/28) of the nodules were correctly identified by CAD. This was similar at reduced dose levels with FBP, iDose(4) and IMR. CAD resulted in a median number of false-positives findings of 11 per scan with FBP at routine dose (93% of the CAD marks) increasing to 15 per scan with iDose(4) (95% of the CAD marks) and 26 per scan (96% of the CAD marks) with IMR at the lowest dose level., CONCLUSION: CAD can identify pulmonary nodules at submillisievert dose levels with FBP, hybrid and model-based IR. However, the number of false-positive findings increased using hybrid and especially model-based IR at submillisievert dose while dose reduction did not affect the number of false-positives with FBP.

2706,"Optimization of CT protocols for thyroid and parathyroid SPECT/CT imaging. The first national survey of patient exposures from hybrid imaging in Nuclear Medicine, performed in Bulgaria in 2014, revealed that SPECT/CT imaging of either thyroid or parathyroid glands was performed by applying a CT scan of the whole anatomical region, neck and chest, subject to SPECT. In most cases it was not necessary to perform a CT scan matching the whole SPECT region. The aim of this study is to propose an optimized CT protocol by reducing the CT scan length. The standard CT protocols for both types of examinations included neck and chest scan with the same exposure data. After the optimization the CT scan was restricted to the region of radiopharmaceutical uptake. Comparison of scan length, dose-length product (DLP) and effective dose from the old and the new protocols was performed. Software was used to estimate effective dose from the CT scan separately for males and females. A total of 17 patients undergoing either thyroid or parathyroid examination received CT of the neck and chest before the optimization. After the introduction of the optimized protocol, data were collected for a total of 70 patients. The mean scan length for males was reduced from 39 to 22 cm (42% reduction) and for females the reduction was from 44 to 22 cm (50%). The mean DLP was decreased by about 34% (from 138 to 91 mGy.cm) for * males and 48% (from 147 to 77 mGy.cm) for females respectively. The effective dose was reduced by 67 % (from 1.8 to 0.6 mSv) for males and 79% (from 2.8 to 0.6 mSv) ! for females. f The introduction of the optimized CT protocol for hybrid SPECT/CT imaging of the thyroid or parathyroid glands led to significant decrease of the total effective dose of the patients from these examinations.Copyright © 2018 Izdatelstvo Medicina i Fizkultura.

2541,"Radioprotective effect of sulfasalazine on mouse bone marrow chromosomes. Sulfasalazine (SAZ), a prescribed drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species. The present study was undertaken to ascertain its ability to protect against gamma radiation-induced damage. Acute toxicity of the drug was studied taking 24-h, 72-h and 30-day mortality after a single intraperitoneal injection of 400-1200 mg/kg body weight (b.wt.) of the drug. The drug LD(50) for 24- and 72-h/30-day survival were found to be 933 and 676 mg/kg b.wt., respectively. The optimum time of drug administration and drug dose-dependent effect on in vivo radiation protection of bone marrow chromosomes was studied in mice. Injection of 30-180 mg/kg SAZ 30 min before gamma irradiation (RT) with 4 Gy produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h after exposure, with a corresponding decrease in the different types of aberrations. The optimum dose for protection without drug toxicity was 120 mg/kg b.wt. At this dose, SAZ produced >60% reduction in the RT-induced percent aberrant metaphases and micronucleated erythrocytes. SAZ also produced a significant increase in the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythrocytes from that of irradiated control. Injection of 120 mg/kg of the drug 60 or 30 min before or within 15 min after 4 Gy whole-body RT resulted in a significant decrease in the percent of aberrant metaphases and in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes at 24 h post-irradiation; the maximum effect was seen when the drug was administered 30 min before irradiation. These results show that SAZ protect mice against RT-induced chromosomal damage and cell cycle progression delay. SAZ also protected plasmid DNA (pGEM-7Zf) against Fenton's reactant-induced breaks, suggesting free radical scavenging as one of the possible mechanism for radiation protection.",Excluded
1375,"Acute toxicity in 14 patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with concurrent cetuximab and radiotherapy. PURPOSE: The authors report acute toxicity in 14 patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiotherapy and cetuximab., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data collection was performed prospectively on patients treated from September 2007 to March 2009. Treatment consisted of 64.8-70 Gy radiotherapy in conventional fractions and cetuximab., RESULTS: Two out of 14 patients did not complete the planned combined treatment; radiotherapy was temporarily suspended in six other patients. Seven of 12 patients received cetuximab until the end of radiotherapy. Treatment breaks were principally due to severe acute cutaneous or mucous toxicity. Any grade acneiform rash occurred in all patients. In-field G3-4 cutaneous toxicity occurred in five (36%) patients and G3-4 mucous toxicity in seven (50%). One patient died of sepsis., CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, severe acute toxic reactions are common in patients treated with radiotherapy and concurrent cetuximab, resulting in frequent breaks or incomplete treatment with potential reduction in disease control.",Excluded
2136,"Comparison of nodal irradiation dose using radiotherapy for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer. The present study aimed to compare incidental nodal irradiation (INI) doses using volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), 5-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (5F-IMRT) and 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) treatment plans for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer (EC). A total of 15 patients with thoracic EC were selected for participation between October 2016 and July 2017 at the Hangzhou Cancer Hospital. Regional lymph nodal stations were contoured according to 3D CT-based images of the Japan Esophageal Society Guidelines. All patients were treated with 60 Gy using VMAT, 5F-IMRT and 3D-CRT plans. Dose-volume histograms of planning target volume (PTV), lung, heart, spinal cord and incidental nodal irradiation were compared between the three plans. 5F-IMRT was superior in PTV_V95% (the volume of the PTV receiving 95% of the prescription dose, P=0.003) and the VMAT plan was best in terms of conformal index (P=0.005). V20 and V30were reduced by 10.7-22.6% (P=0.002) and 12.8-21% (P=0.026), respectively, in normal lung tissue using the VMAT plan. 5F-IMRT demonstrated the lowest maximum dose (Dmax) for the spinal cord (P=0.037). For the INI, 3D-CRT exhibited the highest equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values for 106pre (P=0.014) and 106tb-L (P=0.03) in upper-thoracic EC. The mean EUD of all lymph nodal regions in middle-thoracic EC were >40 Gy in VMAT and 5F-IMRT plans; the VMAT plan had higher EUD values in lower-thoracic EC compared with 5F-IMRT, 3D-CRT plans for INI. VMAT were comparable to the 5F-IMRT plan with respect to dosimetric characteristics for planning and INI doses to thoracic nodal levels NO 105-112 are considerable for thoracic EC.Copyright © 2020 Spandidos Publications.

3442,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of lesions occupying renal space. Indications, limits, personal experience. In focal kidney disease, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using 2 nd generation contrast enhancement allows continuous dynamic assessment of the arterial, venous and late perfusion phases of the renal parenchyma, as well as of focal lesions. CEUS is particularly useful in cases of an uncertain diagnosis after the performance of unenhanced ultrasound (US) and echocolorDoppler (ECD) (e.g. dromedary humps, hypertrophic column of Bertin, outcomes of pyelonephritis), and for differential diagnosis of simple cysts with a suspicious appearance (e.g. cysts with a dense content, calcified cysts) and complex cysts of Bosniak types 2, 3 and 4. Instead, lesions shown to be solid at unenhanced US must be directly evaluated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), both to gain a panoramic view and because CEUS is often unable to reveal the precise nature of such lesions. In agreement with the literature, this experience (18 cases) confirms the utility of CEUS in the diagnosis of renal pseudolesions and complex cystic formations, reducing both the risk of radiation exposure and the use of the more costly CT and MRI methodologies.",Excluded
1045,"Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia After Corneal Graft. Purpose: To describe the clinical features and management of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) after corneal graft. Design(s): Retrospective case series of 4 patients. Method(s): Four eyes of 4 patients treated for OSSN after corneal graft in an institutional setting were included. All 4 patients were treated with topical chemotherapy and additionally 1 patient each was treated with excisional biopsy and photodynamic therapy. The main outcome measure was the recurrence of OSSN and the clarity of corneal graft after treatment. Result(s): The mean time interval between corneal graft and diagnosis of OSSN was 36 months (range, 2 to 73 months). All 4 eyes were on chronic treatment with topical steroids for a minimum duration of 2 months and 2 eyes had previous herpes keratitis. Misdiagnosis of graft rejection was found in 2 cases. The mean tumor basal diameter was 18 mm (range, 14- to 25-mm) and the tumor involved a mean of 76% of the corneal surface (range, 15% to 90%). Management was successful in all cases using topical mitomycin C (n = 1), topical interferon alpha2b (n = 4), and photodynamic therapy (n = 1). At mean follow-up of 20 months, tumor control was achieved in all cases and all 4 eyes showed chronic graft opacification with vascularization but no intraocular tumor. Conclusion(s): Corneal OSSN should be considered in patients using chronic topical steroids for corneal graft. Nonsurgical management with topical chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy can achieve tumor control. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
296,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies. Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded
2269,"Regulation of the metastasis of murine ocular melanoma by natural killer cells. In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed. This study demonstrates the importance of the NK cell as a primary effector cell for the control of metastasis from in vivo derived ocular B16F10 melanoma.",Excluded
2251,"Performance ramifications of abnormal functional connectivity of ventral posterior lateral thalamus with cerebellum in abstinent individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder. The extant literature supports the involvement of the thalamus in the cognitive and motor impairment associated with chronic alcohol consumption, but clear structure/function relationships remain elusive. Alcohol effects on specific nuclei rather than the entire thalamus may provide the basis for differential cognitive and motor decline in Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). This functional MRI (fMRI) study was conducted in 23 abstinent individuals with AUD and 27 healthy controls to test the hypothesis that functional connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus would be compromised in those with an AUD diagnosis and related to mnemonic deficits. Functional connectivity between 7 thalamic structures [5 thalamic nuclei: anterior ventral (AV), mediodorsal (MD), pulvinar (Pul), ventral lateral posterior (VLP), and ventral posterior lateral (VPL); ventral thalamus; the entire thalamus] and 14 functional regions"" was evaluated. Relative to controls, the AUD group exhibited different VPL-based functional connectivity: an anticorrelation between VPL and a bilateral middle temporal lobe region observed in controls became a positive correlation in the AUD group; an anticorrelation between the VPL and the cerebellum was stronger in the AUD than control group. AUD-associated altered connectivity between anterior thalamus and hippocampus as a substrate of memory compromise was not supported; instead, connectivity differences from controls selective to VPL and cerebellum demonstrated a relationship with impaired balance. These preliminary findings support substructure-level evaluation in future studies focused on discerning the role of the thalamus in AUD-associated cognitive and motor deficits.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.""",Excluded
86,"Treatment of symptomatic atrial tachycardia in complex anatomic conditions: Use and outcome of ablation in patients after damus-kaye-stansel surgery. Background: Atrial tachycardias (AT) are amongst the most frequent complications in adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD). Their incidence mainly depends on age and complexity of underlying defect. AT has a marked impact on morbidity and mortality and is associated with sudden cardiac death particularly in complex ACHD patients. The arrhythmic substrate can be variable from re-entry to multifocal resulting in demanding requirements for electrophysiologic ablation procedures (EP) and thus, relatively high rates of recurrence. Methods and Results: Retrospective analysis of ACHD patients with prior Damus-Kaye-Stansel (DKS) surgery treated at one of the largest specialized tertiary centers for ACHD patients worldwide. Analysis focussed on occurrence of AT, respective treatment and outcome of EP. Over a median observation time of 15 years, 13 patients with prior DKS surgery and complex congenital heart defects of different types but uniformly Fontan circulation, were identified (median age 22.0 years (IQR 20.5 - 25.5), 76.9% male, 92.3% NYHA Class I, median systemic ventricular ejection fraction 58.5%, 69.2% extracardiac tunnel). Seven patients (53.8%) presented with symptomatic AT (median cyclic length 440 ms (IQR 360.0 - 517.5)). Of these, six patients underwent EP. Median procedure time was 180.5 min (IQR 160.8 - 274.5), median fluoroscopy time 1.56 min (IQR 0.51 - 4.73) and radiofrequency time 851 sec (265.0 -2005.0). Remote magnetic navigation was used to access ablation site through a retrograde access via the aortic as well as the neo-aortic valve. Three-dimensional image integration aided in mapping and ablation. Throughout the procedure as well as in follow-up visits, no reportable complications were observed. After a mean of 1.5 procedures, all analysed patients stayed complaint-free throughout a median time-interval of 13 months. Conclusion(s): AT are frequent in complex univentricular situations after Damus-Kaye-Stansel surgery (53.8%). Although more than one procedure (mean 1.5) was necessary to achieve satisfactory results even in experienced hands, EP appears to be an appropriate treatment strategy in this young and otherwise healthy patient cohort. According to our analysis, EP is feasible and safe in centers with knowledge of specific anatomic characteristics of congenital heart disease and when the appropriate technical infrastructure is present. Access to ablation site was performed by remote magnetic navigation in the majority of procedures. The floppy catheter was navigated through the neo-aortic as well as through the aortic valve without observable peri- or postinterventional complications. Mapping with three-dimensional image integration facilitated EP and led to a relatively low radiation exposure with the known benefits for the patient as well as for the healthcare professionals involved in the procedure.",Excluded
936,"The epicondylar ratio can be reliably used on X-ray of the knee to determine the joint line. Purpose: The epicondylar ratio (ER) is used to restore the individual joint line (JL), especially in revision total knee arthroplasty. It was first described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but is usually applied to a.p. radiographs of the knee for preoperative planning. The objective of the current study was to define reliable landmarks in MRI and X-ray images of the knee, which allow comparison of the image modalities. Furthermore, the correlation of the measured ER in MRI and X-rays of the knee was calculated. Method(s): A consecutive series of 87 patients who underwent an arthroscopical intervention of the knee were included into the present study. The lateral epicondyle was defined as the most lateral and distal prominence. On the medial side, the measurement was aligned to the epicondylar sulcus. The medial and lateral ER were calculated by dividing the perpendicular distance from the JL to the epicondyle by the transepicondylar distance. One observer determined the ER twice to calculate the intramethod intraobserver agreement, and a second observer obtained the intramethod interobserer agreement. The ER obtained from X-ray and MRI was compared to calculate the intermethod correlation. Result(s): The average lateral ER was 0.29 on X-ray versus 0.28 on MRI. The average medial ER was 0.33 and 0.33, respectively. Intramethod agreement ranged from 0.66 to 0.88 and intermethod correlation from 0.49 to 0.57. Conclusion(s): The ER can be determined reliably on MRI and X-ray images of the knee.

1304,"Analysis of radiation therapy in 1054 patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) treated during 1985-2009. Purpose/Objective(s): Since 15 years ago, our group has conducted nationwide surveys of PCNSL seen at radiation therapy (RT) departments in Japan. The vast majority of the surveyed institutions are university hospitals. So far, data on 1,054 patients treated between 1985 and 2009 have been collected. The purpose of this study was to analyze RT and evaluate treatment outcome in these patients. Materials/Methods: Subjects of the survey were patients with histologically- proven PCNSL who received RT, including those who did not complete planned treatment. Clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of the patients were asked using a detailed questionnaire. Data on 466 patients seen between 1985 and 1994 were collected from 62 institutions, and 273 patients seen between 1995 and 2004 were collected from 30 institutions. Most recently, 315 patients seen between 2005 and 2009 were collected from 20 institutions. Thus, 1,054 patients (630 men and 424 women; median age, 62 years) were evaluable. No patients had AIDSrelated PCNSL. Among the patients, 696 were dead and 358 were alive or lost to follow-up. Median follow-up period for living patients was 37 months. Result(s): For all 1,054 patients, the median survival time (MST) was 24 months and the 5-year survival rate (5YSR) was 25.8%. The MST and 5YSR were 23 months and 24.8%, respectively, for 969 patients treated with whole-brain RT and 25.5 months and 29%, respectively, for 85 patients treated with partial-brain RT (p = 0.80). Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the total radiation dose: (1) 30-39.9 Gy; (2) 40- 49.9 Gy; (3) 50-53.9 Gy; and (4) >= 54 Gy. Patients receiving < 30 Gy were excluded. The MST and 5YSR were significantly better in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy than in the other groups (5YSR was 24%, 32%, 25%, and 21% for groups 1-4, respectively; all p < 0.05 against group 2 receiving 40-49.9 Gy). Even when the analysis was limited to patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and RT, the survival rate was similarly the best in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy (5YSR was 41%, 51%, 37%, and 37% for groups 1-4, respectively). Patients receiving a whole-brain dose < 40 Gy had better survival than those receiving >= 40 Gy (5YSR: 32% vs 20%, p = 0.0005). For patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and partial brain RT (>= 30 Gy), the 5YSR was 51%. Conclusion(s): This large retrospective analysis suggests that the optimal total dose to the tumor may be in the range 40-49.9 Gy, even in combination with methotrexate-containing chemotherapy. Patients receiving partial-brain RT had a prognosis similar to those receiving while-brain RT. The whole-brain dose >= 40 Gy did not seem to be associated with better survival. Partial-brain RT with high-dose methotrexate may worth consideration for patients with a single PCNSL.",Excluded
2769,"Pulmonary nodules: effect of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) technique on performance of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system-comparison of performance between different-dose CT scans. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of ASIR on CAD system of pulmonary nodules using clinical routine-dose CT and lower-dose CT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients (body mass index, 22.17 +/- 4.37 kg/m(2)) were scanned by multidetector-row CT with tube currents (clinical routine-dose CT, automatically adjusted mA; lower-dose CT, 10 mA) and X-ray voltage (120 kVp). Each 0.625-mm-thick image was reconstructed at 0%-, 50%-, and 100%-ASIR: 0%-ASIR is reconstructed using only the filtered back-projection algorithm (FBP), while 100%-ASIR is reconstructed using the maximum ASIR and 50%-ASIR implies a blending of 50% FBP and ASIR. CAD output was compared retrospectively with the results of the reference standard which was established using a consensus panel of three radiologists. Data were analyzed using Bonferroni/Dunn's method. Radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product by conversion coefficient of 0.021., RESULTS: The consensus panel found 265 non-calcified nodules <= 30 mm (ground-glass opacity [GGO], 103; part-solid, 34; and solid, 128). CAD sensitivity was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 71% (overall), 49% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 52% (overall), 67% (solid)] than at 0%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 54% (overall), 25% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 36% (overall), 50% (solid)] (p<0.001). Mean number of false-positive findings per examination was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 8.5; lower-dose CT, 6.2) than at 0%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 4.6; lower-dose CT, 3.5; p<0.001). Effective doses were 10.77 +/- 3.41 mSv in clinical routine-dose CT and 2.67 +/- 0.17 mSv in lower-dose CT., CONCLUSION: CAD sensitivity at 100%-ASIR on lower-dose CT is almost equal to that at 0%-ASIR on clinical routine-dose CT. ASIR can increase CAD sensitivity despite increased false-positive findings. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1851,"Clinical implementation of an emergency department coronary computed tomographic angiography protocol for triage of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Objectives: To evaluate the efficiency and safety of emergency department (ED) coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) during a 3-year clinical experience. Method(s): Single-center registry of coronary CTA in consecutive ED patients with suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The primary outcome was efficiency of coronary CTA defined as the length of hospitalization. Secondary endpoints of safety were defined as the rate of downstream testing, normalcy rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), absence of missed ACS, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) during follow-up, and index radiation exposure. Result(s): One thousand twenty two consecutive patients were referred for clinical coronary CTA with suspicion of ACS. Overall, median time to discharge home was 10.5 (5.7-24.1) hours. Patient disposition was 42.7 % direct discharge from the ED, 43.2 % discharge from emergency unit, and 14.1 % hospital admission. ACS rate during index hospitalization was 9.1 %. One hundred ninety two patients underwent additional diagnostic imaging and 77 underwent ICA. The positive predictive value of CTA compared to ICA was 78.9 % (95 %-CI 68.1-87.5 %). Median CT radiation exposure was 4.0 (2.5-5.8) mSv. No ACS was missed; MACE at follow-up after negative CTA was 0.2 %. Conclusion(s): Coronary CTA in an experienced tertiary care setting allows for efficient and safe management of patients with suspicion for ACS. Key points: * ED Coronary CTA using advanced systems is associated with low radiation exposure. * Negative coronary CTA is associated with low rates of MACE. * CTA in ED patients enables short median time to discharge home. * CTA strategy is characterized by few downstream tests including unnecessary ICA.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
1636,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded
3330,"Synaptic plasticity in the adult spinal dorsal horn: the appearance of new functional connections following peripheral nerve regeneration. Peripherally regenerated fibers were impaled in the dorsal columns. Each impaled fiber's adequate stimulus was determined and the fiber was activated by passing brief (200 ms) current pulses through the microelectrode. Cord dorsum potentials (CDPs) elicited by fiber stimulation were recorded at 8 sites, and then the fiber was injected with Neurobiotin (NB). In the same preparations, dorsal horn cells were impaled and their receptive fields (RFs) mapped; areas of skin from which the most vigorous responses were elicited were noted. Needle electrodes inserted into these cutaneous ""hot spots"" were used to electrically activate minimal numbers of peripherally regenerated fibers while simultaneously recording the resulting CDPs and any intracellular EPSPs. This allowed determination of connectivity between regenerated fibers and dorsal horn cells with overlapping RFs. In agreement with findings in intact animals, NB revealed long-ranging collaterals which were not seen using intraaxonally injected horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Although there was no qualitative difference in their morphology compared to those seen in controls, the correlation between spatial distribution of boutons and amplitudes of the monosynaptic CDPs of peripherally regenerated fibers revealed significant shifts in the functional efficacy of many central connections. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation revealed a significantly higher incidence of connectivity between regenerated fibers and cells with overlapping RFs at 9-12 months (86%) than at 5-6 months (34%). Although there was no obvious anatomical reorganization of afferent projections in the dorsal horn, the observed functional changes with time following transection show the formation of new functional central connections.",Excluded
2727,"Radiosurgery for re-irradiation of brain metastasis: Results in 54 patients. Purpose: To evaluate in terms of probabilities of local-regional control and survival, as well as of treatment-related toxicity, results of radiosurgery for brain metastasis arising in previously irradiated territory. Patients and Methods: Between January 1994 and March 2000, 54 consecutive patients presenting with 97 metastases relapsing after whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) were treated with stereotactic radiotherapy. Median interval between the end of WBRT and radiosurgery was 9 months (range 2-70). Median age was 53 years (24-80), and median Karnofski performance status (KPS) 70 (60-100). Forty-seven patients had one radiosurgery, five had two and two had three. Median metastasis diameter and volume were 21 mm (6-59) and 1.2 cc (0.1-95.2), respectively. A Leksell stereotactic head frame (Leksell Model G, Elektra, Instrument, Tucker, GA) was applied under local anesthesia. Irradiation was delivered by a gantry mounted linear accelerator (linacs) (Saturne, General Electric). Median minimal dose delivered to the gross disease was 16.2 Gy (11.8-23), and median maximal dose 21.2 Gy (14- 42). Result(s): Median follow-up was 9 months (1-57). Five metastases recurred. One- and 2-year metastasis local control rates were 91.3 and 84% and 1- and 2-year brain control rates were 65 and 57%, respectively. Six patients died of brain metastasis evolution, and three of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. One- and 2-year overall survival rates were 31 and 28%, respectively. According to univariate analysis, KPS, RPA class, SIR score and interval between WBRT and radiosurgery were prognostic factors of overall survival and brain free-disease survival. According to multivariate analysis, RPA was an independent factor of overall survival and brain free-disease survival, and the interval between WBRT and radiosurgery longer than 14 months was associated with longer brain free-disease survival. Side effects were minimal, with only two cases of headaches and two of grade 2 alopecia. Conclusion(s): Salvage radiosurgery of metastasis recurring after whole brain irradiation is an effective and accurate treatment which could be proposed to patients with a KPS > 70 and a primary tumour controlled or indolent. We recommend that a dose not exceeding 14 Gy should be delivered to an isodose representing 70% of the maximal dose since local control observed rate was similar to that previously published in literature with upper dose and side effects were minimal. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1088,"Impact of Hybrid Operating Rooms on Long-Term Clinical Outcomes Following Fenestrated and Branched Endovascular Aortic Repair. Purpose: Evaluate the impact of hybrid operating room (HOR) guidance on the long-term clinical outcomes following fenestrated and branched endovascular repair (F-BEVAR) for complex aortic aneurysms. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospectively collected registry data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the procedural, short- and long-term outcomes of consecutive F-BEVAR performed from January 2010 to December 2014 under standard mobile C-arm versus hybrid room guidance in a high-volume aortic center. Result(s): A total of 262 consecutive patients, including 133 patients treated with a mobile C-arm equipped operating room and 129 with a HOR guidance, were enrolled in this study. Patient radiation exposure and contrast media volume were significantly reduced in the HOR group. Short-term clinical outcomes were improved despite higher case complexity in the HOR group, with no statistical significance. At a median follow-up of 63.3 months (Q1 33.4, Q3 75.9) in the C-arm group, and 44.9 months (Q1 25.1, Q3 53.5, p=0.53) in the HOR group, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of target vessel occlusion and limb occlusion. When the endograft involved 3 or more fenestrations and/or branches (complex F-BEVAR), graft instability (36% vs 25%, p=0.035), reintervention on target vessels (20% vs 11%, p=0.019) and total reintervention rates (24% vs 15%, p=0.032) were significantly reduced in the HOR group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences for long-term death and aortic-related death between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that better long-term clinical outcomes could be observed when performing complex F-BEVAR in the latest generation HOR.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded

2014,"Effects of proton pump inhibitor use on the esophageal microbial community. Background: Changes in the esophageal microbiome correlate with esophageal disease, but the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are incompletely characterized. Our objective was to identify the effects of PPI use on the microbial community of the esophagus. Method(s): Mucosal biopsies of the distal esophagus were analyzed using a customized esophageal microbiome qPCR panel array (EMB). Patient demographics, use of PPIs, duration of use and dose were recorded. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients were included. Mean age was 60.5 years. Ninety percent (52/58) of patients were on PPIs. Mean dose was 42.7 mg. Mean duration of use was 2.5 years. The use of PPIs led to a significant difference in absolute levels of only one organism, Actinomyces, in the entire array (p < 0.01). Among patients who used proton pump inhibitors, there was no significant association between dose and absolute levels of any organism. Similarly, there was no association between duration of use and absolute levels of any organism. Conclusion(s): PPI use does not seem to cause significant changes in the distal esophageal microbial community. Future studies with larger sample sizes and esophageal pH testing should be performed to determine the level of acidity and its relationship to the microbial community.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
1361,"Pilot study of concurrent 5-fluorouracil/paclitaxel plus radiotherapy in patients with carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Preoperative concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be highly effective but are often associated with significant rates of morbidity and even mortality. We studied the toxicity of continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and weekly paclitaxel combined with radiotherapy. Patients had histologic proof of local-regional carcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal (GE) junction, a Karnofsky performance status of 70 or greater, and normal liver, renal, and bone marrow functions. Chemotherapy consisted of continuous infusion of 5-FU (300 mg/m2/d) for 5 days a week for 5 weeks, plus paclitaxel (45 mg/m2) given during 3 hours every week for 5 weeks. Based on the tumor location and its resectability, the total dose of concurrent radiation varied between 45 Gy and 50.4 Gy. Nine men and one woman, with a median age of 61 years, were evaluated. One had GE junction cancer, six had distal esophageal cancer, and three had midesophageal cancer. Weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and dysphagia of grades I and II were noted. The hematologic toxicity was mild. No patients required transfusion. There was no leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. None of the patients was hospitalized during chemoradiation; all patients completed treatment as outpatients. Five patients had subsequent surgical resections: one had a pathologically complete response, and two had a partial response (>90% necrosis). Continuous infusion of 5-FU plus paclitaxel given concurrently with radiotherapy was well tolerated. We plan to study this regimen further in upper gastrointestinal cancers.",Excluded
1149,"Targeted therapy for metastatic kidney cancer at a urologic outpatient clinic: Experience of partly nurse administrated treatment. Introduction and Objectives: Since 2006 patients from Gothenburg with metastatic kidney cancer have been treated with targeted therapy at the outpatient clinic of the Urologic department, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Therapy was started by a senior urologist and thereafter administrated by two specialized nurses conducting frequent visits for handing out medicine, blood checks, weight and blood pressure controls, patient education and tending of side effects. The responsible doctor was contacted when adjustment of the treatment was needed. All medicine was handed to the patients to ensure that a minimum of the drugs were wasted. Visits to the doctors were conducted every 4th to 6th month mostly at the time of X-ray or when needed. The objective of the study was to report our experience with targeted therapy at a urologic outpatient clinic performed as partly nurse administered. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2006 and 2012, 82 patients in total were treated with targeted therapy and registered in a database. All treatment and survival data were recorded. There were 56 men and 26 women. Result(s): Eighty-two patients were treated in first line. Treatment time on targeted therapy ranged from 9 days to 3 years and 10 months (median 11.5 months). In the first line 58 (71%) of the patients had sunitinib, 13 (16%) sorafenib, 7 (8%) bevacizumab+interferon, 3 (4%) pazopanib and 1 (1%) had temsirolimus. Thirty-four treatments were started in the second line. Ten treatments were given in the third and 2 in the fourth line. In 2012 33 patients were treated. During that year 213 visits were conducted by the specialized nurses and 54 visits by a senior urologist. Conclusion(s): A partly nurse administrated outpatient treatment with targeted therapy is possible when performed in close contact with the responsible doctor. It makes it possible to follow up the patients with short intervals and provides a close contact which they can always turn to with the numerous problems these patients have without consuming too much of doctor time.",Excluded
1760,"A Prospective Study of Distal Microscopic Spread in Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Pinned and Unpinned Specimen. The most important margin in determining the prognosis of rectal cancer is circumferential resection margin (CRM). But, the type of surgery is determined by distal rectal margin (DRM), whether sphincter saving procedure is possible or patient needs an abdominoperineal resection. There are no standardized uniform guidelines for measurement of DRM. The purpose of this study is to assess the distal microscopic spread beyond gross margin after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) in rectal cancers, the factors influencing the distal microscopic spread, the shrinkage of the distal margin in pinned and unpinned fresh and fixed specimen, and to find out the best method of measurement of distal rectal margin. A prospective analytical study was conducted from May 2013 through February 2015 in 47 cases of carcinoma rectum (both AR and APR) who had received neoadjuvant CCRT. Fresh specimen was collected within 30 min of specimen retrieval and a longitudinal cut was made in the distal margin of all specimens. One side of the specimen was pinned onto a cork board and the other side was left unpinned. Measurements were made from the distal end of clinical gross tumor. DRM was determined in both pinned and unpinned sides in fresh and fixed specimen. Of the 47 patients, 2 patients (4.2%) had small focus of tumor beyond gross margins, 1 at 6 mm and another at 3.5 mm on the unpinned side. The average margin for fresh and fixed pinned specimens was 3.67 and 3.47 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 5.4% for the pinned specimens. The average margin for fresh and fixed unpinned specimens was 3.32 and 2.84 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 14.4% for the unpinned specimens. Six patients (12.7%) had complete pathological response. Correlation of distal margin was better in pinned specimen. A correction factor of 15% for shrinkage needs to be taken into account while assessing unpinned specimen. Only in 4.2% of patients, there was distal submucosal spread beyond gross margin. Long-term follow up is required for assessing adequacy of DRM post neoadjuvant CCRT.Copyright © 2017, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
1961,"Surgical management of osteoradionecrosis of the jaws. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate our 10-year clinical experience in surgical management of patients with osteoradionecrosis (ORN) unresolved with conservative nonoperative treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 120 patients who had been surgically treated for ORN during a 10-year period (January 2003 to January 2013) were retrospectively reviewed., RESULTS: The most predilection ORN site was mandible (82.5%), followed by the maxilla (11.7%). ORN developed within initial 12 months in 39.2% and within the first 3 years in 68.3%. The median radiation dose was 68.1 Gy (range, 35-148 Gy), but 51 patients (42.5%) experienced ORN even though radiation doses were controlled under 60 Gy. Surgical trauma, as we believed, was the most important factor leading to this result. Among all the patients, 12 (10.0%) patients were found ineligible for operative treatment due to comorbid systematic diseases whereas none healed or improved. In terms of surgical management of the rest of the 108 patients, 90 (75.0%) patients underwent radical resection (4 patients unhealed), and 18 (15.0%) patients underwent mild surgical procedures such as sequestrectomy or debridement (1 patient unhealed). Of the 90 radical resection patients, 58 patients underwent radical resections and immediate microvascular flap reconstruction (19 bone flaps and 39 soft flaps), and 32 patients only experience radical resection (5 patients received second-stage reconstruction). According to follow-up information, 55 patients were free of disease., CONCLUSION: Though priority should be given to surgical treatment for the patient whose ORN does not respond to conservative nonoperative treatment, we may as well take into account more individualized regimens based on ORN severity. A hard lesson learned from our article is that the oral maxillofacial surgeon should minimize the trauma for jaws as possible as he can, especially to patients who need to receive postoperative radiotherapy.",Excluded
3360,"[Dental care in patients undergoing radiotherapy of the head and neck]. Radiotherapy involving the oral cavity and salivary glands induces a wide range of alterations in oral tissues and salivary gland functions which may result in oral side effects. Some of these are inevitable and transient such as radiation mucositis, some however may be permanent such as xerostomia. Others however are preventable, and are caused by poor radiation techniques, application of excessive radiation doses or lack of necessary preventive measures. Frequent complications in these patients are development of caries, dental hypersensitivity, rapidly progressive periodontal disease and loss of taste. Occasionally, trismus and osteoradionecrosis may develop. Careful treatment planning before start of radiotherapy with adequate dosimetry and careful shielding of the healthy tissues as well as close monitoring of the oral cavity with strict application of preventive measures (dental care protocol) can significantly reduce the incidence of these complications. The private practitioner should keep in mind the life-long precautions that are necessary when treating these patients.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To propose national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for radiotherapy (RT) computed tomography (CT) localization purposes, compare both CT units used in the largest RT department in the country and to compare gathered results with other published DRLs in order to discover any need of optimization., METHODS: In total, 1631 patient data (time spend of 4 months) regarding sex, examination type, total dose-length product (DLP) and CTDIvol was collated on two CT units. Those simulation procedures account for more than 80 % of all simulation procedures performed nationwide. Then, total DLP and CTDIvol was calculated and mean, median and 3rd quartile for both units together were presented to determine national DRLs for simulation procedures. The same data was later compared between both units to discover any potential need for optimization., RESULTS: 3rd quartile values of DLP for abdomen, breast, chest, head, head and neck, pelvis and spine were 1116.2, 606.6, 832.4, 1942.4, 969.2, 677.1 and 1042.4 mGy.cm, respectively. 3rd quartile CTDIvol values for the same sequence of procedures were 18.7, 13.3, 19.2, 76.9, 22.6, 17.9 and 22.2mGy, respectively. Among the two units, the mentioned dose values were on average significantly higher on one CT unit than on the other unit., CONCLUSIONS: When comparing collected dose values with other studies, RT CT DRLs showed that radiation doses from our institution were similar or even lower. Some variations were found between both CT units in certain protocols, so exposure parameters should be reviewed and optimized. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

322,"Impacts of ionising radiation on sperm quality, DNA integrity and post-fertilisation development in marine and freshwater crustaceans. Crustaceans have been designated as internationally important model organisms in the development of environmental radioprotection measures. Despite the known sensitivity of sperm to ionizing radiation, the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility in crustaceans have not been studied. For the first time, the present study aimed to assess the impacts of chronic radiation exposure on male fertility, sperm DNA damage and concomitant impacts on breeding in two amphipod crustaceans. Echinogammarus marinus and Gammarus pulex (male fertility only) were exposed to phosphorus-32 at dose rates of 0, 0.1, 1 and 10mGy/d and sperm parameters, DNA damage and knock-on impacts on breeding were assessed. Sperm quality parameters and DNA damage were assessed using a fluorescent staining method and single cell gel electrophoresis respectively. Concomitant effects of male exposure to radiation on fecundity were determined by pairing phosphorus-32 exposed males to unexposed sexually mature females. In E. marinus, a statistically significant reduction of 9 and 11% in the quality of sperm was recorded at dose rates of 1 and 10mGy/d respectively, with no significant effects recorded on sperm counts. Conversely in the freshwater G. pulex, no significant impact of radiation on sperm quantity or quality was recorded. For E. marinus, a statistically significant increase in DNA damage was recorded at doses of 10mGy/d. Reduced fecundity and an increase in the frequency of abnormal embryos was recorded in female E. marinus breeding with males exposed to radiation. These findings suggest sperm quality may be a sensitive indicator of radiation exposure in invertebrates with potential impacts on the unexposed embryo, though unclear dose-response and differences between two closely related species necessitate further study before robust conclusions can be drawn.

1298,"Individual radiosensitivity and correlation with tumoral regression. Purpose/Objective(s): On the one hand, higher individual radiosensitivity increases the risk for side effects of radiotherapy, on the other hand it could also lead to improved tumor response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Our point of interest was the correlation of individual radiosensitivity (gH2AX as a reliable factor of radiosensitivity) and regression of the rectal cancer. Materials/Methods: We investigated a total of 22 patients (19 male, 3 female, all in stage T3 N0/N + M0) with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (RCT) followed by resection. Before treatment, 2ml of blood was collected, lymphocytes were isolated and irradiated with 2 Gy. After 24 hours, lymphocytes were stained with gH2AX antibodies. We compared our results with untreated lymphocytes of the same patient. At least 500 lymphocytes (and the included gammaH2AX -foci) were microscopically analyzed per patient. Subsequently, we statistically evaluated the correlation of the number of gammaH2AX foci (gammaH2AX as a sign for unrepaired DNA DSB), and tumor regression (RG) by Dworak et al. (RG 0 to 4; RG 0: no regression, RG 4: complete regression). Result(s): Five of 22 (23%) had a complete (RG 4), and 11 (50%) patients an almost complete tumoral regression (RG 3); However, 6 patients showed only a minor regression (RG1-2). In the untreated lymphocytes an average of 0.36 (+/- 0.21) foci was counted; after irradiation with 2 Gy and a 24 hour delay 2.25 Foci were still present. Tumoral regression (RG 3 + 4 vs. RG 0-2) correlated positively (p = 0.05) with the number of gammaH2AX-foci. However, regression did not correlate with other parameters such as age, weight, tumor size, dose and volume. Conclusion(s): In patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum there is an obvious positive correlation of remaining gH2AX foci in peripheral lymphocytes and histopathological regression of primary tumor. These findings could be an indication that patients of rectal cancer with increased radiosensitivity benefit of better response to neoadjuvant RCT.",Excluded

Purpose/Objective(s):We are developing real-time 3D/4D video guidance to reduce breast and chest wall setup errors and track target motion during post-mastectomy chest wall/nodal irradiation, breast only irradiation, and breast nodal irradiation in a clinical trial. We have also compared the reliability, accuracy, and precision of camera-based IGRT with results of weekly portal image verification and weekly CBCT volumetric matching. Materials/Methods: One-hundred forty patients, 102 breast only, 23 breast + nodal, and 15 chest wall + nodal, were accrued in an IRB-approved clinical trial of IGRT using 3D/4D optical images at daily setup and beamon time. Breast board and vacuum bag were used for all patients. Eleven patients with left-side diseases were treated under deep inspiration breath hold using ABC device and twenty-two patient using IMRT. Target shifts and rotations relating to CT-based planned reference surface were determined with real-time optical surface images using modified iterativeclosest-point alignment. A selected light ray intersecting the middle-upper abdominal surface and the anterior surface of the target projected onto the principal components were used as the real-time point/marker-based and surface/volume-based motion tracking, respectively. The optical guidance and real-time respiratory motion tracking were completely performed by therapists and results were semi-automatically saved in the camera-control computer. The target displacements (shifts and rotations) were compared with results of the weekly CBCT and portal images from EPID. Motion curves of surface Intersection point and surface principal components were also compared with breathing volume curves from the ABC system. Result(s): Daily target setup errors were reduced from 0.9 cm to <0.4 cm by using the 3D/4D video surface-guidance that was always consistent with results of portal images and CBCT if there were no big body motion during CBCT scanning. Higher accuracy and precision of 0.2 cm and longer stability without hardware change for clinical usage in four years were achieved for the video camera operated at the imaging speed and tracking rate of 15 frames per second. The novel intersection point and surface motion trackings were also more sensitive and accurate than that of commercial RPM and ABC systems. UP to 2 cm body sag on the slant breast board during longer IMRT treatments and surface deformation for five large breasts and some patients undertaken deep breath hold irradiation were detected. Conclusion(s): Accurate and precise optical image-guided setup of breast and chest wall targets was clinically validated with thousands of portal images and CBCT scans on 140 patients. More importantly, one can reliably track irregular target motion during daily dose delivery and detect gross target deformation during the entire course of treatment.

BACKGROUND: HIV status may affect outcomes after definitive chemoradiotherapy for anal cancer. OBJECTIVE(S): Here, we report a large series in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era comparing outcomes between HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients with anal cancer. DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review. SETTINGS: The study was conducted at an outpatient oncology clinic at large academic center. PATIENTS: A total of 107 patients were reviewed, 39 HIV positive and 68 HIV negative. All of the patients underwent definitive chemoradiation for anal cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on patient characteristics, treatment, toxicity, and outcomes were collected. Overall survival, colostomy-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were analyzed. RESULT(S): Median follow-up was 15 months. HIV-positive patients were younger (median, 52 vs 64 years; p < 0.001) and predominantly men (82% men vs 49% men; p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in T, N, or stage groups. HIV-positive patients had a significantly longer duration from biopsy to start of chemoradiation (mean number of days, 82 vs 54; p = 0.042). There were no differences in rates of acute toxicities including diarrhea, fatigue, or dermatitis. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher rates of hospitalization (33% vs 15%; p = 0.024). The 3-year overall survival rate was 42% in HIV-positive and 76% in HIV-negative patients (p = 0.037; HR, 2.335 (95% CI, 1.032-5.283)).

One year after 131I therapy, 56.7% were euthyroid, 33.9% were still thyrotoxic and 9.4% were hypothyroid. Discriminant analysis of all pretreatment variables identified thyroid mass, presenting free thyroxine index and 4 h 131I uptake as the three variables most helpful in discriminating the early outcome group of 131I therapy. The findings suggest that patients with large goitres and severe disease may require higher doses of 131I for treatment of Graves' disease.",Excluded
144,"Ultra-low-dose computed tomography and its utility in wrist trauma in the emergency department. Background: The use and frequency of computed tomography (CT) are increasing day by day in emergency departments (ED). This increases the amount of radiation exposed. Purpose(s): To evaluate the image quality obtained by ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) in patients with suspected wrist fractures in the ED and to investigate whether it is an alternative to standard-dose CT (SDCT). Material(s) and Method(s): This is a study prospectively examining 336 patients who consulted the ED for wrist trauma. After exclusion criteria were applied, the patients were divided into the study and control groups. Then, SDCT (120 kVp and 100 mAs) and ULDCT (80 kVp and 5 mAs) wrist protocols were applied simultaneously. The images obtained were evaluated for image quality and fracture independently by a radiologist and an emergency medical specialist using a 5-point scale. Result(s): The effective radiation dose calculated for the control group scans was 41.1 +/- 2.1 microSv, whereas the effective radiation dose calculated for the study group scans was 0.5 +/- 0.0 microSv. The effective radiation dose of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01). The CT images in the study group showed no significant differences in the mean image quality score between observer 1 and observer 2 (3.4 and 4.3, respectively; P = 0.58). Both observers could detect all fractures using the ULDCT images. Conclusion(s): ULDCT provides high-quality images in wrist traumas while reducing the radiation dose by approximately 98% compared to SDCT without any changes in diagnostic accuracy.Copyright © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2021.",Excluded

This system is an ergometer to be flown and installed in the International Space Station in the year 2004. The system consists of a control electronics that controls a motor, to which a subject is connected by means of a restraining system named HRS (Human Restraint System). This ergometer can be used for 11 movements (wrist flexion/extension, wrist pronation/supination, and wrist radial/ulnar deviation; trunk flexion/extension; arm pull/press, leg pull/press; elbow flexion/extension; Shoulder flexion/extension; hip flexion/extension; knee flexion/extension; and ankle dorsal/plantar flexion). The HRS must meet the following anthropometric range: from 5 percentile Japanese female to 95 percentile American male. The complete MARES system follow the verification of the specifications set at the start of the project. As part of this verification, it was necessary to perform what we have called a ""Population Testing"", that is a test verifying those specifications where the interaction with a human being is unavoidable to check the compliance: Anthropometric range Supported movements Nominal position Impairment Body position reproducibility Electrodes compatibility Joint alignment stability Comfort These verification tests included a population sample of six people per movement covering from 5 percentile Japanese female to 95 percentile American. Tests referring to the design of the HRS were described in a previous SAE paper. The results of these tests on the electrode compatibility, joint alignment stability and comfort are presented and discussed for three movements: wrist prono/supination, trunk flexion/extension and ankle dorsi/plantarflexion. The results of the tests allow a complete evaluation of the HRS of the MARES system that will be flown in the International Space Station. Copyright 2003 SAE International.",Excluded
2750,"Decreasing the dose of radioiodine for remnant ablation does not increase structural recurrence rates in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Background Our aim was to compare the rate of structural recurrence between patients who had lesser doses of radioactive iodine (RAI) and those who had traditional greater doses for remnant ablation after total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods A retrospective cohort study of patients who had undergone thyroidectomy and RAI for PTC was undertaken. We divided the cohort into those who had <=3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group A) and those who had >3 GBq (75 mCi) RAI (group B). The primary outcome measure was the rate of structural recurrence. Results Of 1,171 patients with PTC from 1990 to 2012 who were followed for a mean of 60 months, 970 with T1-T3 tumors underwent RAI in addition to thyroidectomy. The mean first dose of RAI was 2.5 GBq (68 mCi) for group A (n = 153) and 4.7 GBq (127 mCi) for group B (n = 817; P <.001). The overall rate of recurrence was 8%. When corrected for T stage, the recurrence rates were not different for T1 tumors (2% group A versus 4% group B; P =.54) nor for T2 and T3 tumors (P =.36 and.55, respectively). On multivariate analysis, the dose of RAI was not an independent predictor for structural recurrence. Conclusion Decreasing the dose of RAI at initial ablation for patients with pT1-pT3 PTC does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of structural cancer recurrence. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.

2344,"Investigation of PKC isoform-specific translocation and targeting of the current of the late afterhyperpolarizing potential of myenteric AH neurons. AH neurons in the enteric nervous system play an essential role in initiating intestinal reflexes and factors that control AH neuron excitability therefore influence the state of the digestive system. Prominent afterhyperpolarizations that follow action potentials in these neurons strongly affect their excitability. In the present work, we have investigated the regulation of the afterhyperpolarizing current (I(AHP)) by protein kinase C (PKC). Electrophysiological responses and protein translocation were investigated in AH neurons of freshly dissected preparations of myenteric ganglia from the guinea-pig ileum. The activator of conventional and novel PKCs, phorbol dibutyrate, but not the activator of novel PKCs, ingenol, blocked the I(AHP). Phorbol dibutyrate had no effect on the hyperpolarization-activated current (I(h)) or on the A current (I(A)). Stimulation of synaptic inputs to the neurons also reduced the I(AHP), and had no effect on I(h) or I(A). Phorbol dibutyrate also reduced a background outward current that was present after the I(AHP) current had been blocked by clotrimazole. Both phorbol dibutyrate and ingenol caused translocation of the novel PKC, PKCepsilon, in these neurons. Only phorbol dibutyrate caused translocation of PKCgamma, a conventional PKC. The studies thus indicate that the activation of PKC by phorbol esters and by nerve stimulation affects AH neurons in a similar way, and that PKC activation targets both the I(AHP) and another background K(+) current. The I(AHP) is targeted by a conventional PKC, suggested to be PKCgamma, as this is the only conventional PKC that is prominent in AH neurons.",Excluded
1089,"Chest Computed Tomography Radiation Dose Optimization: Comparison of Automatic Exposure Control Strength Curves. PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to compare radiation dose and image quality between the ""average"" and the ""very strong"" automatic exposure control (AEC) strength curves., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Images reconstructed with filtered back-projection techniques and radiation dose data of unenhanced helical chest computed tomography (CT) examinations obtained at 2 hospitals (hospital A, hospital B) using the same scanner devices and acquisition protocols but different AEC strength curves were evaluated over a 3-month period. The selected AEC strength curve applied to ""slim"" patients (diameter <32 cm estimated from the attenuation automatically measured on the topogram) was ""average"" and ""very strong"" in hospital A and hospital B, respectively. Two radiologists with 13 and 24 years of experience scored the image quality of the lung parenchyma and the mediastinum on a 5-point scale. The patients' effective diameter, the delivered CT dose index volume, and dose-length products were recorded., RESULTS: A total of 410 patients were included. The average body mass index was 24.0 kg/m in hospital A and 24.8 kg/m in hospital B. There was no significant difference between hospitals with respect to age, sex ratio, weight, height, body mass index, effective diameters, and image quality scores for each radiologist (P ranging from 0.050 to 1.000). The mean CT dose index volume for the entire population was 2.0 mGy and was significantly lower in hospital B with the ""very strong"" AEC curve as compared with hospital A (-11%, P=0.001). The mean dose-length product delivered in this 70 kg-weight population was 68 mGy cm, corresponding to an effective dose of 0.95 mSv., CONCLUSION: Changing the AEC strength curve from ""average"" to ""very strong"" for slim patients maintains image quality and reduces the radiation dose to <1 mSv in routine chest CT examinations reconstructed with filtered back-projection techniques.",Excluded

Our results show considerable variability concerning age and activity applied. Also, the number of MN and the number of binucleated cells with micronuclei (BNMN) showed Poisson regression adjust for within subject correlation overdispersion. Log dose alone was not significant. The interaction of time and dose was significant at higher doses, while the rate of MN changing was slower. Relative risk time was calculated for the lowest dose (259 MBq). By doubling the dose, the rate of daily increase in the number of MN and BNMN decreases by approximately 5% (Relative risk MN = 0.955; Relative riskBNMN = 0.954).",Excluded
2172,"Establishing a local computed tomography dose reference level for adults based on acceptable quality dose approach. Introduction The present study attempted to establish local Computed Tomography DRL by collecting radiation doses of the three most frequently performed CT examinations at our institute. The present study focuses on the local DRLs which are based on clinical indications as the main determinants of patient radiation dose in correlation with acceptable image quality within facility. Method The present study included a total 125 patient imaged on Helical MDCT Ingenuity (Philips Healthcare, Cleveland, USA) 42 detector rows 128 slice. The CT examinations performed were for CT head for acute stroke, routine chest CT and routine abdomen CT examinations. A set of common data was collected for each CT examinations such as patient ID, age, weight, beam width, rotational time, image quality score (IQS). The CT dose parameters displayed CTDIvol and DLP were also measured for scout image and diagnostic CT respectively during each single phase CT examination. The median value was calculated for individual clinical CT examination based on standard of adequate image quality. Results The patients underwent CT in this study were in the range of 25 to 70 years of age with mean +/- SD age (49.8 +/- 15.3). The medium DLP calculated was 1195.8 mGy.cm, 333.2 mGy.cm and 512.9 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3. The scout image median DLP calculated was 4.2 mGy.cm, 3.8 mGy.cm and 3.7 mGy.cm for acute stroke head, routine chest and routine abdomen CT examination respectively for IQS of 3. Conclusion The purpose of this study was integration of DRL with clinical image quality. The optimization of doses was correlated with diagnostic adequacy of clinical image. Further the study is ongoing to collect data and categorize on the basis of different weight group to further optimize the dose index for CT.",Excluded
1991,"The Value of Computed Tomography Imaging of the Head After Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Surgery in Adults. BACKGROUND: Patients with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for hydrocephalus often undergo multiple follow-up computed tomography (CT) scans of the head, increasing the risk for long-term effects of ionizing radiation. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the necessity as a routine diagnostic procedure and cost analysis of routine postoperative CT scan of the head after ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery. METHODS: In this study, we comprised adults with ventriculoperitoneal shunt operations who underwent early CT scans within 48 hours postoperatively. We reviewed the correlation between revision surgery rate and the experience of surgeons who performed surgery and provided a cost analysis. RESULTS: In total, 479 surgeries were performed in 439 patients. Early revision surgery was performed in 11 (2.3%) patients. Reason for revision surgery was malposition in 9 cases and intracerebral hemorrhage in 2 patients. There was no significant correlation between the surgeon's experience and the rate of revision surgery. Placement of the ventricular catheter via an approach other than a standard right or left frontal burr hole resulted in risk of need for surgical shunt revision (P >= 0.002, odds ratio 54, confidence interval 13.5-223). A total of 468 CT scans of the head revealed a normal finding; thus, ~$562,000 could be saved by omitting postoperative head CT scans. CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative head CT scans after fentriculoperitoneal shunting are not necessary in all cases. The reduction of exposure to ionization radiation and the beneficial economic factor are main advantages.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate whether single-fraction radiotherapy is equal to multiple fractions in the treatment of painful metastases., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study planned to recruit 1000 patients with painful bone metastases from four Norwegian and six Swedish hospitals. Patients were randomized to single-fraction (8 Gy x 1) or multiple-fraction (3 Gy x 10) radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of the study was pain relief, with fatigue and global quality of life as the secondary endpoints., RESULTS: The data monitoring committee recommended closure of the study after 376 patients had been recruited because interim analyses indicated that, as in two other recently published trials, the treatment groups had similar outcomes. Both groups experienced similar pain relief within the first 4 months, and this was maintained throughout the 28-week follow-up. No differences were found for fatigue and global quality of life. Survival was similar in both groups, with median survival of 8-9 months., CONCLUSIONS: Single-fraction 8 Gy and multiple-fraction radiotherapy provide similar pain benefit. These results, confirming those of other studies, indicate that single-fraction 8 Gy should be standard management policy for these patients.",Excluded
375,"Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Percutaneous microwave coagulation therapy (PMCT) has recently been introduced as a new treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Japan. This study was performed to evaluate its efficacy and safety., METHODOLOGY: Thirteen patients with 17 nodules of unresectable HCC were subjected to PMCT under ultrasonic guidance. The tumors ranged from 1.2-4.4 cm in size. Assessment of the efficacy of PMCT was made by follow-up with dynamic computed tomography (CT)., RESULTS: In the patients with small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm), 5 out of 7 nodules developed local recurrence after PMCT. Regarding assessment of the necrotic area after PMCT, dynamic CT revealed enhancement that was possibly caused by congestion of the liver parenchyma surrounding the area of necrosis due to PMCT in the early phase of the treatment. Therefore, the necrotic area must be assessed carefully. Although a slight heat sensation and/or pain during microwave irradiation (a common effect of PMCT) occurred in all patients, there were no serious adverse effects., CONCLUSIONS: Complete remission of small HCC ( or = 2.1 cm). There were no serious adverse effects from PMCT and the therapy can be safely carried out even in patients with poor liver function.",Excluded

Background: To evaluate the safety of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of bone metastases in oligometastatic disease and to investigate prognostic factors of local control (LC), progression/disease-free survival (PDFS), and overall survival (OS). Method(s): Eligibility criteria were number of metastates <=5, controlled primary tumor without evidence of progression under systemic therapy, exclusion of surgery, and no previous radiotherapy of the lesion of interest. Oligometastatic status was classified into only bone (BOD) and outside bone disease (OBOD), whereas SBRT was delivered to bone lesions using 2 different schedules: 24 Gy/1 fraction or 27 Gy/3 fractions. A positron emission tomography study of the lesion of interest was performed at baseline and at 3 months after SBRT to evaluate metabolic response according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria. A Cox regression model was used for univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): Between January 2010 and December 2013, 40 patients were enrolled. Only 1 patient experienced severe late toxicity (radiation-related fracture). Local control was longer among responders' than nonresponders' lesions (94.2% and 91.2% versus 63% and 35% at 1 and 2 years, respectively) (p = 0.004; hazard ratio = 9.958). The multivariate analysis of PDFS showed a significant correlation with planning target volume (PTV) size (p = 0.003) and oligometastatic status (p = 0.002). The multivariate analysis of OS confirmed a statistically significant value of the oligometastatic status (p = 0.002) and a significant trend for PTV size (p = 0.065). Conclusion(s): Stereotactic body radiotherapy is safe with a low incidence of severe toxicity. Positron emission tomography response was a strong prognostic factor of LC whereas BOD status and small PTV size could identify a subset of oligometastatic patients at better prognosis.Copyright © 2015 INTM, Italy.",Excluded
1806,"Outcomes of a COVID-19 respiratory follow up clinic in a large tertiary referral centre. Introduction Current guidelines for follow up of COVID-19 patients are based on experience with outbreaks with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), with the aim to identify patients likely to develop post infectious fibrosis. The COVID-19 pandemic is on a much larger scale and requires investigation regarding the most effective way to follow up these patients. Methods We set up a pathway to allow us to screen selected discharged patients to identify those who required further investigations. Discharged patients were identified following admission between March and June 2020 using electronic hospital records. Patients who were not suitable to be called were excluded, and a letter was written to their GP explaining this. All other patients were called approximately 6 weeks after discharge. Information was collected including ongoing symptoms, admission radiological changes, and selected questionnaires. Patients with ongoing symptoms were invited back for investigations and face-to-face appointment, and anyone without symptoms but x-ray changes was invited for repeat X-ray at 10 weeks. Results Of the 828 admissions, 281 died, and a further 182 were unsuitable to call. Of those called, 88% (321) answered, and 65 remained symptomatic and were seen in clinic. 154 people required a repeat chest x-ray, 8 subsequently had a CT thorax and clinic review. 56 people did not attend for follow-up x-ray and were discharged. Of the 73 people seen, 59 had interstitial changes based on radiological criteria; 29 of these were resolving inflammation which did not require further follow up as the patients were also clinically improving. 30 patients, 11 with fibrotic changes, required observation or treatment. Four patients received oral prednisolone and 7 had received intravenous methylprednisolone earlier. In the symptomatic group, PEs, pulmonary hypertension, adenocarcinoma in situ and breathing pattern disorders were also diagnosed. Conclusion Less than 10% of patients required treatment with steroids after admission with COVID-19 infection. This is lower than previous estimates following MERS/SARS infection. Interestingly, severe radiology changes did not predict the likelihood of developing fibrosis. The screening telephone clinic was a useful way of identifying those with ongoing symptoms who required further investigation.",Excluded
2641,"Agreement between SPECT V/Q scan and CT angiography in patients with high clinical suspicion of PE. Objective: To track agreement between single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT) V/Q and CT angiography in patients with high clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism (PE). If significant agreement occurs, a case could be made for more frequent use of chest radiography followed by SPECT V/Q scanning given its lower risk profile. Introduction: Diagnosis of PE can be difficult. CT pulmonary angiography (CTA) is the preferred initial test, but may be indeterminate, is a significant source of ionizing radiation, and is contraindicated in renal insufficiency. SPECT ventilation/perfusion imaging (V/Q) is therefore preferred in certain patients. Method(s): Two thousand nine hundred and twenty patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in New York City were screened and 100 consecutive high-risk patients who required both CTA and V/Q for an initial indeterminate or negative imaging test despite a high pre-test probability were identified. The agreement between these tests was evaluated. Result(s): There was no significant agreement between CTA and V/Q when positive, negative and indeterminate results were included (K = 0.18, SE = 0.09, p = 0.051). However, in the presence of a positive finding on either test, there was substantial agreement between the two (K = 0.62, SE = 0.27, p = 0.02). In 30 cases in which CTA was indeterminate, V/Q was diagnostic 93 % of the time. In 12 cases in which V/Q was indeterminate, CTA was diagnostic 83 % of the time and negative in 100 % of those cases. Conclusion(s): In the presence of an indeterminate CTA in patients with high clinical suspicion of PE, SPECT V/Q often provides a diagnosis. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Excluded
3578,"Time-related changes in computed tomographic appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency ablation of the rabbit lung: Preliminary experimental study. PURPOSE: To evaluate correlations between computed tomographic (CT) appearance and pathologic findings after radiofrequency (RF) ablation of lungs and to determine whether CT appearance could predict the extent of the effective therapeutic area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The lungs of 14 rabbits were subjected to RF ablation and CT scans were obtained immediately and at various intervals thereafter. Four rabbits were killed immediately after the initial CT imaging (n = 4). The remaining 10 rabbits were killed after additional CT scans at intervals of 3 days (n = 2), 1 week (n = 4), 2 weeks (n = 2), and 3 weeks (n = 2) after RF ablation. Pathologic findings were correlated with CT appearance. RESULT(S): Immediately after RF ablation, a restricted area of central dense opacity enclosed by an extensive area of ground-glass opacity was noted in the ablated region on CT images. Pathologically, the former corresponded to destructive tissue and the latter corresponded to tissue with some degree of injury. After 1 week, the entire ablated region appeared as a well-demarcated homogeneous dense opacity on CT that corresponded to necrotic tissue and its surrounding rim of granulation tissue on histopathologic examination, indicating that the enclosing extensive area of ground-glass opacity on the initial CT scan represented an ongoing necrosis. Within 2-3 weeks, the ablated region gradually contracted on the CT images, representing a tissue repairing process in which the granulation tissue was encroaching on the inner necrotic tissue. CONCLUSION(S): Ground-glass opacity of the ablated region on CT immediately after RF ablation represents an ongoing necrosis. © SIR, 2005.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To develop a real-time dose-monitoring system to measure the patient's eye lens dose during neuro-interventional procedures., METHODS: Radiation dose received at left outer canthus (LOC) and left eyelid (LE) were measured using Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor dosimeters on 35 patients who underwent diagnostic or cerebral embolization procedures., RESULTS: The radiation dose received at the LOC region was significantly higher than the dose received by the LE. The maximum eye lens dose of 1492 mGy was measured at LOC region for an AVM case, followed by 907 mGy for an aneurysm case and 665 mGy for a diagnostic angiography procedure. Strong correlations (shown as R(2)) were observed between kerma-area-product and measured eye doses (LOC: 0.78, LE: 0.68). Lateral and frontal air-kerma showed strong correlations with measured dose at LOC (AKL: 0.93, AKF: 0.78) and a weak correlation with measured dose at LE.

PURPOSE: This trial was undertaken to compare the rates of resectability between patients treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation vs. boosted radiotherapy alone., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically unresectable rectal cancer were randomized to receive external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to pelvis (45 Gy) with concurrent oral Capecitabine (CRT group; Arm 1) or EBRT to pelvis (45 Gy) alone followed by 20 Gy dose of localized radiotherapy boost to the primary tumor site (RT with boost group, Arm 2). All patients were assessed for resectability after 6 weeks by clinical examination and by CT scan and those deemed resectable underwent surgery., RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were randomized, 46 to Arm 1 and 44 to Arm 2. Eighty seven patients (44 in Arm 1 and 41 in Arm 2) completed the prescribed treatment protocol. Overall resectability rate was low in both the groups; R0 resection was achieved in 20 (43 %) patients in Arm 1 vs. 15 (34 %) in Arm 2. Adverse factors that significantly affected the resectability rate in both the groups were extension of tumor to pelvic bones and signet ring cell pathology. Complete pathological response was seen in 7 and 11 %, respectively. There was greater morbidity such as wound infection and delayed wound healing in Arm 2 (16 vs. 40 %; p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Escalated radiation dose without chemotherapy does not achieve higher complete (R0) tumor resectability in locally advanced inoperable rectal cancers, compared to concurrent chemoradiation.",Excluded
3550,"Radiation pneumonitis in breast cancer patients treated with taxanes: does sequential radiation therapy lower the risk?. Taxanes are now routinely used in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT) as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Recent publications have reported several cases of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving RT and taxane chemotherapy, thus raising concern as to the safety of this combination. To decrease the potential risk of RP, we sequenced RT after taxane chemotherapy with a target interval of 3-4 weeks in two consecutive institutional breast protocols. Forty patients were treated on two adjuvant systemic protocols consisting of modified radical mastectomy (n = 9) or breast-conserving surgery (n = 31), followed by adjuvant doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and a sequential taxane (ACT), followed by RT. All patients had either node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer and were treated between October 2000 and September 2002. Postmastectomy, a median dose of 5040 cGy was delivered to the chest wall. After breast-conserving surgery, a median dose of 4680 cGy was delivered to the breast plus a 1400 cGy boost to the surgical cavity. Information regarding RP was gathered retrospectively by reviewing patient records. With a median follow-up of 28 months (range 6-42 months), no cases of clinical RP were identified and no local failures had occurred. The median time interval for all patients between the completion of chemotherapy and the initiation of RT was 34 days (range 5-70 days). At the latest follow-up, 2 patients were diagnosed with metastatic disease and 38 patients were without evidence of disease. Sequencing of RT after taxane therapy with a target interval of 3-4 weeks does not appear to result in increased pulmonary toxicity and is associated with good local control.",Excluded
3292,"Cost-effectiveness of computed tomography screening for lung cancer in the United States. INTRODUCTION: A randomized trial has demonstrated that lung cancer screening reduces mortality. Identifying participant and program characteristics that influence the cost-effectiveness of screening will help translate trial results into benefits at the population level.
METHODS: Six U.S. cohorts (men and women aged 50, 60, or 70 years) were simulated in an existing patient-level lung cancer model. Smoking histories reflected observed U.S. patterns. We simulated lifetime histories of 500,000 identical individuals per cohort in each scenario. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained ($/QALY) were estimated for each program: computed tomography screening; stand-alone smoking cessation therapies (4-30% 1-year abstinence); and combined programs.
RESULTS: Annual screening of current and former smokers aged 50 to 74 years costs between $126,000 and $169,000/QALY (minimum 20 pack-years of smoking) or $110,000 and $166,000/QALY (40 pack-year minimum), when compared with no screening and assuming background quit rates. Screening was beneficial but had a higher cost per QALY when the model included radiation-induced lung cancers. If screen participation doubled background quit rates, the cost of annual screening (at age 50 years, 20 pack-year minimum) was below $75,000/QALY. If screen participation halved background quit rates, benefits from screening were nearly erased. If screening had no effect on quit rates, annual screening costs more but provided fewer QALYs than annual cessation therapies. Annual combined screening/cessation therapy programs at age 50 years costs $130,500 to $159,700/QALY, when compared with annual stand-alone cessation.
CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of computed tomography screening will likely be strongly linked to achievable smoking cessation rates. Trials and further modeling should explore the consequences of relationships between smoking behaviors and screen participation.",Excluded
3012,"The expression of PDGF-BB predicts curative effect in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated by radiotherapy. Radiotherapy is the major approach and is well tolerated in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). And nowadays, no effective biological markers have been identified for predicting the prognosis of patients with ESCC. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is associated with a poor prognosis of various malignancies. The present study aimed to assess the effect of PDGF-BB on radiotherapeutic responses of ESCC and the underlying mechanisms of its roles in ESCC. Serum from 68 cases that received neoadjuvant or radical radiotherapy was obtained before and during radiotherapy. Gene expression analyses were validated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The prognosis of patients with significantly reduced PDGF-BB was probably better than that of the others found in the progression-free survival and overall survival groups. Depletion of PDGFB significantly suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of cancer cells. Inhibiting PDGFB induced cellular apoptosis and promoted the sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR). Furthermore, IR inhibited PDGF-BB-induced migration by blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway in ESCC cells. We found that the expression of PDGF-BB provided a possible model for predicting ESCC radiotherapy. It can also be used as a prognostic indicator for locally advanced ESCC that was treated by radiotherapy.",Excluded
645,"TRAIL enhances efficacy of radiotherapy in a p53 mutant, Bcl-2 overexpressing lymphoid malignancy. Background and purpose: Resistance to apoptosis is a contributing factor in the response to radiotherapy. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether TRAIL - in a soluble isoleucine zippered form - enhances the cytotoxic effect of irradiation on tumour cells with a blockade in the mitochondrial apoptosis route and/or a dysfunctional p53 pathway. Material(s) and Method(s): The p53 mutant human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia line Jurkat transduced with the Bcl-2 gene was used as model system in vitro and in a subcutaneous transplant setting in immunodeficient mice. Sensitivity to single and combined treatment was read out by apoptosis hallmarks and clonogenic survival in vitro, and by bioluminescence and palpation in vivo. Result(s): Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 did not undergo apoptosis after irradiation, but the combination with TRAIL synergistically induced apoptosis without breaking mitochondrial resistance. TRAIL also reduced clonogenic survival after irradiation. In vivo, radiotherapy or TRAIL alone delayed tumour outgrowth, but combination treatment had the most profound effect. Conclusion(s): Isoleucine zippered TRAIL can strongly enhance the efficacy of tumour therapy with ionising radiation in an unfavourable setting of p53 mutation and Bcl-2 overexpression. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2207,"Optimization of tube current in coronary multidetector computed tomography angiography: assessment of a standardized method to individualize current selection based on body habitus. UNLABELLED: This study sought to extract information on individual patient habitus from scout imaging and to correlate radiograph tube current settings with enhancement of the coronaries as a function of patient profiles for coronary multidetector computed tomography., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients underwent coronary 64-slice multidetector computed tomography consisting of 2-plane scouts and electrocardiography-gated coronary studies at 64 x 0.625 mm, radiograph voltage of 120 kVp, and radiograph currents of 295 to 788 mA, which were reconstructed during 65%, 75%, and 85% R-R intervals. Patients' weight was recorded. On scout imaging, chest diameters were determined, and circumferences were calculated. To determine whether body weight showed sex-specific characteristics, t test was used. Pearson correlation determined whether cross-sectional measurements reflected female/male body habitus. On coronary imaging, contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of the aorta and the coronaries were calculated. To assess whether CNRs differed throughout the diastolic phase, t test was used. Data triplets of CNRs and the corresponding current and circumference were plotted; CNRs less than 250 Hounsfield unit (HU) were discarded, dissecting lines as 95th percentiles correlating radiograph currents and patients' circumferences were calculated., RESULTS: Female/male weights differed significantly (P = 0.0006); circumferences based on scouts adequately reflected body weight (coefficients, 0.86 male/0.87 female). Homogenous vascular enhancement of the aorta (mean +/- SD, 344.4 +/- 81.8 HU) and the right (292.3 +/- 82.8 HU) and left (285.8 +/- 81.3 HU) coronaries was achieved (P > 0.005). Ninety-fifth percentile cutoffs identified linear relationships between patient's circumference and the minimal adequate radiograph current achieving CNR less than or equal to 250 HU., CONCLUSION: Scout imaging can be used to determine individual patient habitus; habitus-adjusted minimal radiograph tube current cutoff levels identified in this study ensuring clinically required levels of coronary enhancement can be used for future coronary CT angiography optimization of tube current based on scout imaging.",Excluded
1872,"Automatic, three-segment, MR-based attenuation correction for whole-body PET/MR data. PURPOSE: The combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) tomography in a single device is anticipated to be the next step following PET/CT for future molecular imaging application. Compared to CT, the main advantages of MR are versatile soft tissue contrast and its capability to acquire functional information without ionizing radiation. However, MR is not capable of measuring a physical quantity that would allow a direct derivation of the attenuation values for high-energy photons., METHODS: To overcome this problem, we propose a fully automated approach that uses a dedicated T1-weighted MR sequence in combination with a customized image processing technique to derive attenuation maps for whole-body PET. The algorithm automatically identifies the outer contour of the body and the lungs using region-growing techniques in combination with an intensity analysis for automatic threshold estimation. No user interaction is required to generate the attenuation map., RESULTS: The accuracy of the proposed MR-based attenuation correction (AC) approach was evaluated in a clinical study using whole-body PET/CT and MR images of the same patients (n = 15). The segmentation of the body and lung contour (L-R directions) was evaluated via a four-point scale in comparison to the original MR image (mean values >3.8). PET images were reconstructed using elastically registered MR-based and CT-based (segmented and non-segmented) attenuation maps. The MR-based AC showed similar behaviour as CT-based AC and similar accuracy as offered by segmented CT-based AC. Standardized uptake value (SUV) comparisons with reference to CT-based AC using predefined attenuation coefficients showed the largest difference for bone lesions (mean value +/- standard variation of SUV(max): -3.0% +/- 3.9% for MR; -6.5% +/- 4.1% for segmented CT). A blind comparison of PET images corrected with segmented MR-based, CT-based and segmented CT-based AC afforded identical lesion detectability, but slight differences in image quality were found., CONCLUSION: Our MR-based attenuation correction method offers similar correction accuracy as offered by segmented CT. According to the specialists involved in the blind study, these differences do not affect the diagnostic value of the PET images.",Excluded
3658,"Dissecting the hematopoietic microenvironment. V: limitations of repair following damage to the hematopoietic support stroma. Damage and repair of the hematopoietic microenvironment of the spleen was studied using X-irradiation, anoxic necrosis induced by splenic ligation, or a combination of the two, as the destructive agents. Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other. The exhaustion of regenerative capacity displayed by repeatedly ligated spleens suggested a maximal limit for stromal cell replications commensurate with Hayflick's hypothesis.",Excluded
146,"Comparing outcomes of stereotactic body radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. OBJECTIVES: Survival in patients with locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer (LAUPC) is poor, and local recurrence continues to be a major problem in the management of this disease. Radiotherapy (RT) using different RT techniques, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), may lead to different clinical outcomes for patients with LAUPC. Here, we compared SBRT with IMRT for patients with LAUPC with respect to survival rate, local control (LC) rate, and toxicity-related dose distribution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study from March 2007 to March 2011 included 41 patients with LAUPC who were divided into two groups, with 20 patients receiving SBRT and 21 patients receiving IMRT. The median follow-up time was 16 months. RESULT(S): For the IMRT and SBRT groups, the median survival times were 13 and 20 months, and 1-year overall survival (OS) rates were 70.7 and 80.0%, respectively. There was no difference in OS between the two RT techniques. RT with SBRT showed significantly better local disease-free survival than IMRT for patients with LAUPC. Tobacco use had a borderline effect on LC. Thus, further statistical analysis showed that patients who used tobacco had better LC after receiving SBRT than IMRT. CONCLUSION(S): SBRT improved LC for LAUPC patients and had similar radiation toxicity compared with IMRT. Further study is required to define the effects of administered radiation dose and fractionation, as well as to further expand the sample size, to use a prospective study, and to observe the long-term efficacy of these techniques..Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

1659,"Blood pressure variability in normotensive patients-correlation to body mass index and age. The aim of the study was to show the differences in BPV regarding gender, age and body mass index (BMI) in normotensive patients. The study included 40 normotensive patients (22 women and 18 men. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was performed using Space-lab 90217 monitor. From these measurements we obtained data on overall (o), wake (w) and sleep (s) systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP) heart rate (HR) and percentage of time when SBP, DBP and MAP were above limits (%TAL). Patients were divided into groups regarding gender, BMI 25 kg/m2 and age 40. Three ABPMs were not technically acceptable, and three cases of hypertension were detected (2 men and 1 woman). Thirty-four ABPMs were statistically analyzed (21 female, 13 male). There were no significant differences in age or BMI between men and women or within groups. oSBP (p=0.028), oPP and oPP variability (p=0.023, p=0.005, respectively), o%TAL of SBP (p=0.048), wSBP and BPV of wSBP (p=0.031 and p = 0.005, respectively) were significantly higher in group of patients withBMI > 25kg/m2. BPV of wDBP correlated to BMI in women (p=0.008). Men had significantly higher oSBP compared to women (p = 0.029) as well as BPV of oSBP (P =0.01). They had significantly greater o%TAL of SBP (p=0.02) and o%TAL ofDBP (p=0.018) as well as wSBP (p=0.02). oSBP and o%TAL of SBP correlated to BMI in women (p=0.012, p=0.02, respectively), but not in men. Both absolute blood pressure values and BPV of systolic blood pressure during the daytime correlated with BMI in all patients. This study showed connection between BPV of diastolic blood pressure during the nighttime and BMI of female patients. No difference in BPV was detected regarding the age of patients.

202,"Need for neck dissection after radiochemotherapy? A study of the French GETTEC group. Background/Hypothesis: The need for a neck dissection after radiochemotherapy (RCT) for patients with unresectable cancer of the head and neck remains questionable. We evaluated our strategy to perform a neck dissection in patients with a controlled primary tumor based on the response to RCT according to regional control, survival rates, and morbidity. Study Design: The French Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs de la Tete et du Cou"" (GETTEC) group retrospectively performed a multicenter review. One hundred and three stage III (N=7) or IV (N=96) patients with unresectable primary tumors and node-positive disease and no distant metastases treated between 1996 and 2002. Tumors were considered unresectable or with poor surgical curability based on advanced stage, or patients were surgically unfit for medical reasons. Result(s): With a median follow-up of 30 months, the complete clinical and radiological nodal response rate was 61%. Among 39% (N=40) of patients with residual neck disease, 70% (N=28) underwent a neck dissection, whereas the remaining 30% either underwent watchful follow-up for probable scary nodes, or were deemed unresectable or medically unfit for surgery. Half of the neck dissection specimens showed pathological evidence of viable tumor. Grade 3 to 4 complications were recorded in four patients (14%) after neck dissection. Regional control was better for complete responders. Disease-free survival and overall survival were similar between patients with a complete response in the neck and no neck dissection, and patients with a neck dissection for residual neck disease. Conclusion(s): The strategy to avoid a neck dissection is safe in patients with a complete response in the neck, regardless of initial nodal stage. In patients with residual neck disease, postRCT neck dissection can be performed with limited morbidity. Progress is warranted to optimize the pathological response in the nodes and to better assess ambiguous nodal responses with multi-modal imaging. © 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.""",Excluded

3356,"Protocol of a thyroid cancer longitudinal study (t-calos): A prospective, clinical and Epidemiological study in Korea. Introduction: Thyroid cancer incidence in Korea is the highest in the world and has recently increased steeply. However, factors contributing to this sudden increase have not been fully elucidated, and few studies have explored the postoperative prognosis. The Thyroid Cancer Longitudinal Study (T-CALOS) was initiated with three aims: (1) to identify factors predicting quality of life, recurrence, and incidence of other diseases after thyroid cancer treatments; (2) to investigate environmental exposure to radiation, toxicants and molecular factors in relation to tumour aggressiveness; and (3) to evaluate gene-environment interactions that increase thyroid cancer in comparison with healthy participants from a pool of nationwide population-based healthy examinees. Methods and analysis: T-CALOS enrols patients with incident thyroid cancer from three general hospitals, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital and National Medical Center, Korea. The study is an ongoing project expecting to investigate 5000 patients with thyroid cancer up until 2017. Healthy examinees with a normal thyroid confirmed by sonography have been enrolled at the Healthy Examination Center at Seoul National University Hospital. We are also performing individual matching using two nationwide databases that are open to the public. Follow-up information is obtained at patients' clinical visits and by linkage to the national database. For statistical analysis, we will use conditional logistic regression models and a Cox proportional hazard regression model. A number of stratifications and sensitivity analyses will be performed to confirm the results. Ethics and dissemination: Based on a large sample size, a prospective study design, comprehensive data collection and biobank, T-CALOS has been independently peer-reviewed and approved by the three hospitals and two funding sources (National Research Foundation of Korea and Korean Foundation for Cancer Research).

1529,"Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP regimen) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus cisplatin in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background and Objective: Clinical trials on docetaxel plus cisplatin (DDP) (TP regimen) in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still uncertain due to limited samples. This study was to compare the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus DDP in treating locally advanced NPC. Method(s): Fifty-seven patients with stage T3-4N2-3M0 NPC diagnosed pathologically from December 2005 to December 2006 were randomized into TP group (30 patients) and DDP group (27 patients). Both groups received TP regimen as induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2, repeating every 21 days for two cycles. For concurrent chemotherapy, TP group were administered docetaxel (60 mg/ m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2; DDP group were administered DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 1. Both schedules were repeated every 21 days for two cycles. Linear accelerator was used as radioactive source. Irradiation field was designed with CT-simulation and conventional fractions. Result(s): The 57 patients received 111 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and 53 of them received 103 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy; four patients ceased induction chemotherapy and three ceased concurrent chemotherapy. All patients completed radiotherapy. The major toxicity of induction chemotherapy was hematologic toxicity; the main toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were hematologic toxicity and mucositis. The occurrence rates of Grade 3-4 leucopenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in DDP groups (p < 0.05). In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the application rate of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in TP group than in DDP group (100% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.05). After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rates of the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes were 93.3% and 92.9% in TP group, and were 96.3% and 91.3% in DDP group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The short-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen on locally advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with DDP. The toxicity of the former schedule is severer than that of the latter, but it is tolerable with the use of G-CSF. The long-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen need to be further studied. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded

Purpose To investigate morphological changes of the corneal epithelium and subbasal nerves in patients with corneal allodynia using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Design Case-control study of patients with corneal allodynia and healthy controls. Methods Ten eyes of six patients were diagnosed with corneal allodynia at a single center and compared to fifteen healthy eyes. IVCM of the central cornea was performed on all subjects and controls. Images were retrospectively analyzed numbers of total corneal subbasal nerves, main trunks and branches, total nerve length and density, nerve branching, and tortuosity, superficial and basal epithelial cell densities, and superficial epithelial cell size. Results Corneal allodynia was seen in patients with dry eye disease, recurrent corneal erosion syndrome, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and Accutane use. Compared to controls, patients with corneal allodynia had a significant decrease in the total numbers of subbasal nerves (P=.014), nerve branches (P=.006), total nerve length (P=.0029), total nerve density (P=.0029) and superficial and basal epithelial cell densities (P=.0004, P=.0036) with an increase in superficial epithelial cell size (P=.016). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of subbasal nerve main trunks (P=.09), nerve branching (P=.21), and nerve tortuosity (P=.05). Conclusions Corneal IVCM enables near-histological visualization and quantification of the cellular and neural changes in corneal allodynia. Regardless of etiology, corneal allodynia is associated with decreased corneal epithelial cell densities, increased epithelial cell size, and decreased numbers and lengths of subbasal nerves despite an unremarkable slit-lamp examination.

Purpose: To determine the factors that affect mean absorbed dose and fluoroscopic times during renal artery stent placement. Material(s) and Method(s): After institutional review board approval, the HI-IQ database was queried for patients undergoing renal artery stent placement only from January 2007 to June 2010. Procedures that were performed as part of other procedures such as iliac artery stents were excluded. The HI-IQ data included fluoroscopy time (f) and radiation dose (mGy). Demographic, medical history, procedural details, and advanced preprocedural renal artery stent imaging were obtained. Variables (number of stents, average body mass index , number of stents placed per year and number of years service of an interventional physician, pre-procedural imaging, and use of embolic protection device) were analyzed using a t test after log transformation and testing for variance with an F test. Result(s): A total of 134 patients (75 males, 70.6 +/- 10.5 years old) underwent the placement of 177 renal artery stents (unilateral [n =95], average stent per patient =1.3). Mean fluoroscopy time was 15.6 minutes and mean absorbed dose to the patient was 1729 mGy. The average fluoroscopic time and absorbed dose was significantly higher with bilateral stent placement compared to unilateral placement (13.8 vs 19.7 minutes, P =.002; 1803 vs 2380 mGy, P =.03).

3164,"Exploring lag and duration effect of sunshine in triggering suicide. BACKGROUND: Sunshine is considered to have a beneficial impact on mood. Interestingly, it has been consistently found that the incidence of suicide reaches a peak during early summer., METHODS: In order to explore the pattern of sunshine and suicide risk in a time frame of up to nine days and investigate possible lag and duration parameters of sunshine in the triggering of suicide, Greek daily suicide and solar radiance data were analyzed for a 10-year period using logistic regression models., RESULTS: The solar radiance during the day before the suicide event was significantly associated with an increased suicide risk (OR=1.020 per MW/m2). The average solar radiance during the four previous days was also significantly associated with an increased suicide risk (OR=1.031 per MW/m2). Differences among genders include the longer sunshine exposure needed in males to trigger suicide, compared to females and a lag period of three to four days that was found to lapse in females till the suicide. The increase in suicide risk in June compared to December, attributable to the daily sunshine effect, varies from 52% to 88%, thus explaining the already known suicide monthly seasonality., LIMITATIONS: No individual data on solar radiance exposure, mental disorders, alcohol consumption or suicide method were available., CONCLUSION: The effect of sunshine in the triggering of suicide may be mediated through a mechanism with a specific lag and duration effect, during the nine days preceding suicide. We hypothesize that sunshine acts as a natural antidepressant which first improves motivation, then only later improves mood, thereby creating a potential short-term increased risk of suicide initially upon its application.",Excluded

To determine whether female patients operated on for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have a survival advantage compared to male patients. Methods and study design. We analyzed data from 1,426 prospectively collected patients submitted to lung resection for NSCLC between 1999 and 2008. Results. Two groups, including 1,014 male and 412 female patients, were compared. Female patients were significantly younger, were more frequently asymptomatic, were less likely to be smokers, had better preoperative respiratory function, had a lower frequency of COPD, and were less commonly affected by cardiovascular comorbidity than men. Adenocarcinoma was more frequently present and early pathological stage (stage IA) more frequently detected in women at diagnosis. The operative mortality was significantly lower among women (1.6% vs 4.6%) (P = 0.012), and women underwent significantly more segmentectomies and fewer pneumonectomies (P = 0.001). The disease-related 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in women (66% vs 51%) (P = 0.0008). At univariate analysis the absence of symptoms at presentation, lower pathological stage, squamous cell type, and female gender were positive factors influencing long-term survival. At multivariate analysis low pathological stage, squamous cell type and female gender were confirmed as independent positive prognostic predictors. Women had a significant survival advantage irrespective of the histological subtype at pathological stage IA, IB, IIB and IIIA disease (P <0.05). Conclusions. Female gender was confirmed to be a particular subset amongst patients affected by NSCLC and exerted a positive effect on disease-related survival of patients submitted to surgical resection. This important effect of gender should be cautiously kept in mind in analyzing the results of current and future trials for lung cancer therapy.",Excluded
2035,"A Radiation Dose Reduction Technology to Improve Patient Safety During Cardiac Catheterization Interventions. OBJECTIVES: A novel radiation dose reduction technology was evaluated in a cardiac catheterization laboratory during routine clinical care to determine if it could reduce radiation dose to patients undergoing coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. These results were compared to patients undergoing similar procedures in a cardiac catheterization laboratory without this technology., BACKGROUND: There is a safety priority in clinical care to reduce X-ray radiation dose to patients in order to lower the risk of deterministic and stochastic effects. Dose reduction technologies must be verified in clinical settings to prove if they reduce X-ray radiation dose and to what extent., METHODS: Radiation dose data and procedure characteristics of 268 consecutive patients were collected and analyzed from a cardiac catheterization laboratory with dose reduction technology installed (referred to as Lab A, n = 135) and from a cardiac catheterization laboratory without this technology (referred as Lab B, n = 133)., RESULTS: For diagnostic procedures, the median total dose-area product in Lab A was reduced by 46% (P < 0.0001) compared to Lab B, with no differences in terms of body mass index (P = 0.180), total fluoroscopy times (P = 1), number of acquired images (P = 0.920), and contrast medium (P = 0.660).

Visual acuity (VA) was measured using VA charts, and contrast VA and that with glare (glare VA) were examined using a contrast sensitivity tester. Ocular higher-order aberrations (HOAs) were measured using a Hartmann-Shack aberrometer., RESULTS: Mean scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix of the optic was significantly higher in the acrylic group than in the silicone and PMMA groups (P < .0001). Mean uncorrected VA, photopic and mesopic contrast VA and glare VA, and HOAs did not differ significantly among groups, although mean corrected VA in the acrylic group was significantly better than that in the other groups (P = .0023). Scattering light intensity of the surface and internal matrix did not correlate with VA, contrast VA, or glare VA, and did not correlate with ocular and internal optic HOAs in the acrylic group., CONCLUSIONS: At more than 10 years postoperatively, visual function, including contrast sensitivity, and ocular HOAs were comparable among eyes that received acrylic, silicone, and PMMA IOLs. Surface scattering and glistenings with the acrylic IOLs were not significantly correlated with visual function and optical aberrations. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1012,"Irradiated male tsetse from a 40-year-old colony are still competitive in a Riparian forest in Burkina Faso. BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies are the cyclical vectors of African trypanosomosis that constitute a major constraint to development in Africa. Their control is an important component of the integrated management of these diseases, and among the techniques available, the sterile insect technique (SIT) is the sole that is efficient at low densities. The government of Burkina Faso has embarked on a tsetse eradication programme in the framework of the PATTEC, where SIT is an important component. The project plans to use flies from a Glossina palpalis gambiensis colony that has been maintained for about 40 years at the Centre International de Recherche-Developpement sur l'Elevage en zone Subhumide (CIRDES). It was thus necessary to test the competitiveness of the sterile males originating from this colony., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the period January-February 2010, 16,000 sterile male G. p. gambiensis were released along a tributary of the Mouhoun river. The study revealed that with a mean sterile to wild male ratio of 1.16 (s.d. 0.38), the abortion rate of the wild female flies was significantly higher than before (p = 0.026) and after (p = 0.019) the release period. The estimated competitiveness of the sterile males (Fried index) was 0.07 (s.d. 0.02), indicating that a sterile to wild male ratio of 14.4 would be necessary to obtain nearly complete induced sterility in the female population. The aggregation patterns of sterile and wild male flies were similar. The survival rate of the released sterile male flies was similar to that observed in 1983-1985 for the same colony., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that gamma sterilised male G. p. gambiensis derived from the CIRDES colony have a competitiveness that is comparable to their competitiveness obtained 35 years ago and can still be used for an area-wide integrated pest management campaign with a sterile insect component in Burkina Faso.",Excluded
1067,"Simulator training reduces radiation exposure and improves trainees' performance in placing electrophysiologic catheters during patient-based procedures. Background: Currently, training in interventional electrophysiology is based on conventional methodologies, and a paucity of data on the usefulness of simulation in this field is available. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulator training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Method(s): Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7.0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1.5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1-3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Result(s): Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1.71 +/- 1.24 to 0.42 +/- 0.68 (P <.001), from 121 +/- 88 seconds to 76 +/- 54 seconds (P <.001), and from 175 +/- 138 seconds to 102 +/- 74 seconds (P <.001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 +/- 220 seconds to 305 +/- 111 seconds (P <.0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures. Conclusion(s): During the early phase of the trainees' learning curve, simulator training significantly improves the independent trainees' performance with reduction in radiation exposure. © 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

Male offspring from OW dams gained greater (p < 0.005) body weight and %fat mass assessed by NMR, X-ray CT and adipose tissue weights when fed high fat diet (45% fat). Hepatic microarray analyses at postnatal day 21 revealed 147 transcripts were significantly (+/-1.8-fold, p < 0.05) altered by maternal OW, including expression of 20 known SREBP-1-regulated transcripts. Expression of SREBP-1 mRNA and lipogenic transcripts was confirmed using real-time PCR. Increased nuclear levels of SREBP-1 and recruitment to the FASN promoter were confirmed via ELISA and ChIP analyses, respectively. Decreased expression of 10 PPARalpha regulated genes including FGF21 was also uncovered. FGF21 serum levels were lower (p< 0.05) in OW dam offspring. Further serum levels of high mol wt adiponectin (p < 0.05) were decreased in OW dam offspring at weaning. While no changes in %fat mass or adipose tissue adiponectin mRNA were observed, hepatic expression of AdipoR1 and R2 were lower in OW dam offspring. Finally, phosphorylation of the adiponectin target AMPK was significantly decreased in livers of OW dam offspring. Our data suggest that maternal OW at conception leads to increased lipogenic gene expression in concert with decreased PPARalpha-adiponectin-AMPK signaling in the liver of young offspring.",Excluded
3433,"Resistance exercise as a countermeasure to disuse-induced bone loss. During spaceflight, skeletal unloading results in loss of bone mineral density (BMD). This occurs primarily in the spine and lower body regions. This loss of skeletal mass could prove hazardous to astronauts on flights of long duration. In this study, intense resistance exercise was used to test whether a training regimen would prevent the loss of BMD that accompanies disuse. Nine subjects (5 men, 4 women) participated in a supine maximal resistance exercise training program during 17 wk of horizontal bed rest. These subjects were compared with 18 control subjects (13 men, 5 women) who followed the same bed rest protocol without exercise. Determination of treatment effect was based on measures of BMD, bone metabolism markers, and calcium balance obtained before, during, and after bed rest. Exercisers and controls had significantly (P < 0.05) different means, represented by the respective following percent changes: lumbar spine BMD, +3% vs. -1%; total hip BMD, +1% vs. -3%; calcaneus BMD, +1% vs. -9%; pelvis BMD, -0.5% vs. -3%; total body BMD, 0% vs. -1%; bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, +64% vs. 0%; alkaline phosphatase, +31% vs. +5%; osteocalcin, +43% vs. +10%; 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, +12% vs. -15%; parathyroid hormone intact molecule, +18% vs. -25%; and serum and ionized calcium, -1% vs. +1%. The difference in net calcium balance was also significant (+21 mg/day vs. -199 mg/day, exercise vs. control). The gastrocnemius and soleus muscle volumes decreased significantly in the exercise group, but the loss was significantly less than observed in the control group. The results indicate that resistance exercise had a positive treatment effect and thus might be useful as a countermeasure to prevent the deleterious skeletal changes associated with long-duration spaceflight.",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy in patients with inoperable endobronchial carcinoma. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were, respectively, 57% and 29% (overall) (median, 28.6 months), 81% and 56% (cancer-specific), and 68% and 50% (local disease-free). Acute toxicity included pneumothorax (1.5%) and mucosal inflammation (10%). Late complications were hemoptysis (6.6% with 5% of fatalities), bronchitis (19.5%), and necrosis (3.5%). In multivariate analysis, a distal tumor location and the use of two catheters were associated with improved local disease-free survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively) and a distal tumor location with improved overall survival (p = 0.0001).

In this preliminary study, we examined the association of the SIPA1 -313A>G (rs931127) polymorphism with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in 351 inoperable patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy (curative or palliative). The GG homozygotes had significantly shorter PFS under codominant and recessive models in all patients (hazard ratio (HR) 1.47, p = 0.035, and HR 1.47, p = 0.022, respectively) and in advanced stage subgroup (HR 1.49, p = 0.037, and HR 1.48, p = 0.023, respectively). The GG genotype was also associated with reduced OS and PFS (codominant model: HR 2.41, p = 0.020, and HR 2.34, p = 0.020, respectively; recessive model: HR 2.16, p = 0.026, and HR 2.18, p = 0.022, respectively) in radiotherapy alone subgroup. Moreover, the SIPA1 -313GG was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for PFS in the cohort. Our results indicate, for the first time, that the SIPA1 -313A>G may have a prognostic role in unresected NSCLC making it a potential predictor of poor survival due to earlier progression.Copyright © 2014, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",Excluded

We queried the National Cancer Data Base for stage I-II Hodgkin lymphoma patients and analyzed radiation dose in patients receiving combined modality therapy (CMT). We found a higher use of 20 Gy as a component of CMT after 2010, the year of publication of the GHSG HD10 trial results., Introduction: Treatment for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) involves radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or combined modality therapy (CMT). We analyzed reduction of RT dose in CMT, particularly in the context of German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 randomized trial results of 2010. Patients and Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with stage I-II HL receiving CMT. RT dose and associated characteristics were analyzed. Stage I and absence of B symptoms were used as a surrogate for early-stage favorable disease. Result(s): Of 31,301 patients with stage I-II HL, 11,457 received CMT between 2004 and 2015. Using the surrogate defined above, 1955 patients (17.1%) were classified as having favorable disease. The majority (61.6%) received 30-36 Gy, while 7.0% received 20 Gy. The provision of 20 Gy was more common in stage I patients (12.3% vs. 5.4% in stage II) and at academic facilities (10.8% vs. 6.3%-8.9% at other facilities). Use of 20 Gy (vs. 30-36 Gy) was less likely with thorax site (odds ratio [OR] 0.43 vs. head and neck), stage II disease (OR 0.41), and B symptoms (OR 0.33). Notably, the use of 20 Gy increased dramatically after 2010 (the year of publication of GHSG HD10 trial results), with rates of 12.3% in 2010-2015 versus 0.1% in 2004-2009 (OR 6.3, P <.001). This was even more pronounced in cases of favorable early-stage disease, with 25.5% after 2010 versus 2.8% before 2010 (OR 13.2, P <.001). The use of doses > 36 Gy decreased over a corresponding time period (OR 0.44, P <.001).

The aim of the current planning study is to evaluate the ability of gadoxetate disodium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (EOB-MRI)-guided stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) planning by using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques in sparing the functional liver tissues during SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were enrolled. Functional liver tissues were defined according to quantitative liver-spleen contrast ratios >=1.5 on a hepatobiliary phase scan. Functional images were fused with the planning computed tomography (CT) images; the following 2 SBRT plans were designed using a ""step-and-shoot"" static IMRT technique for each patient: (1) an anatomical SBRT plan optimization based on the total liver; and (2) a functional SBRT plan based on the functional liver. The total prescribed dose was 48 gray (Gy) in 4 fractions. Dosimetric parameters, including dose to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV D95%), percentages of total and functional liver volumes, which received doses from 5 to 30Gy (V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30), and mean doses to total and functional liver (MLD and fMLD, respectively) of the 2 plans were compared. Compared with anatomical plans, functional image-guided SBRT plans reduced MLD (mean: plan A, 5.5Gy; and plan F, 5.1Gy; p<0.0001) and fMLD (mean: plan A, 5.4Gy; and plan F, 4.9Gy; p<0.0001), as well as V5 to V30 and fV5 to fV30. No differences were noted in PTV coverage and nonhepatic organs at risk (OARs) doses.

Background In gastric MALT lymphomas persisting after Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, a treatment by moderate-dose radiotherapy (RT) has been proposed but its efficacy has not been confirmed in large prospective series with long term endoscopic follow-up. Method Patients with localised gastric MALT lymphoma persisting after H. pylori eradication were offered moderate-dose RT (30 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction) and followed with annual endoscopies. All biopsies before and after RT were reviewed by a committee of pathologists. Results From 1995 to 2011, out of the 232 patients followed prospectively, 53 received RT for persistence of lymphoma after H. pylori eradication: either macroscopic ulcer (n = 31), or microscopic lymphomatous infiltrate (n = 22), after a mean follow-up of 12 and 31 months, respectively. All lymphomas were localised (45 stage IE and 8 stage IIE) and 38 (72%) were H. pylori-positive. The mean clinical and endoscopic follow-up from diagnosis was 7.6 years (2.2-19.1). No acute or late toxicity occurred. A complete remission was achieved in all patients but one (98%) with no relapse after a median follow-up of 4.9 years (1.3-16.6) after completion of RT. Overall survival and 5-year disease specific survival were 94% and 100%, respectively. One patient died of gastric adenocarcinoma.

2144,"CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous gastrostomy with loop gastropexy and peel-away sheath trocar technique in 31 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Background: In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients with respiratory impairment and/or advanced disease, performing even mild sedation - as is usually necessary for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements - is fraught with risk. These patients are often referred to Interventional Radiology for alternative percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement options. Purpose: To report our experience with CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous gastrostomy with a novel loop gastropexy and peel-away sheath trocar technique in ALS patients as an alternative to endoscopic techniques. Material and Methods: A consecutive series of 31 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients in whom endoscopic gastrostomy was considered too dangerous or impossible to perform underwent CT-guided percutaneous gastropexy and gastrostomy and prospective follow-up. All procedures were performed with a 15 FR Frekaw Pexact gastrostomy kit, a 16-row CT scanner (Aquilion 16) and single shot CT fluoroscopy mode. Results: The procedure was performed successfully in 30 of 31 patients (20 men, 11 women; median age 60 years, range 38-80 years). In the remaining case the stomach was punctured under CT fluoroscopy and CO2 insufflation was initiated thereafter, leading to successful gastrostomy without prior gastropexy and without further adverse events during follow-up. Two patients reported unproblematic exchange of a balloon tube due to skin irritations with no further adverse events. One patient reported accidental displacement of an exchanged new balloon tube in domestic environment due to balloon leakage: A new balloon tube was easily re-inserted in a hospital the same day. No serious adverse events such as peritonitis, persistent local bleeding, systemic blood loss, or any local infection requiring surgical intervention were observed. Until August 11, 2011 follow-up resulted in 7473 cumulative gastrostomy-days from the date of first placement. Conclusion: Initial results suggest that the described technique under CT guidance is feasible and safe and may especially be advantageous in cases where endoscopic gastrostomy and sedation are contraindicated.",Excluded

Purpose: Low-field MRI, allowing imaging in supine and weight-bearing position, may be utilized as a non-invasive and affordable tool to differentiate between causes of dissatisfaction after TKA ('problematic TKA'). However, it remains unclear whether low-field MRI results in sufficient image quality with limited metal artefacts. Therefore, this feasibility study explored the diagnostic value of low-field MRI concerning pathologies associated with problematic TKA's' by comparing low-field MRI findings with CT and surgical findings. Secondly, differences in patellofemoral parameters between supine and weight-bearing low-field MRI were evaluated. Method(s): Eight patients with a problematic TKA were scanned using low-field MRI in weight-bearing and supine conditions. Six of these patients underwent revision surgery. Scans were analysed by a radiologist for pathologies associated with a problematic TKA. Additional patellofemoral and alignment parameters were measured by an imaging expert. MRI observations were compared to those obtained with CT, the diagnosis based on the clinical work-up, and findings during revision surgery. Result(s): MRI observations of rotational malalignment, component loosening and patellofemoral arthrosis were comparable with the clinical diagnosis (six out of eight) and were confirmed during surgery (four out of six). All MRI observations were in line with CT findings (seven out of seven). Clinical diagnosis and surgical findings of collateral excessive laxity could not be confirmed with MRI (two out of eight).

However, patient survival remains unsatisfactory. Objective(s): We conducted a feasibility study of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NeoCRT) with CDDP plus 5-FU and elective nodal irradiation in patients with stage IB/II/III ESCC. Aim of follow up study is to clarify the long term outcome and site of recurrence. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligibility criteria included clinical stage IB/II/III ESCC, a PS of 0-1, and age of 20-75 years. Chemotherapy consisted of 2 courses of 5-FU (1000mg/m2, days 1-4) and CDDP (75mg/m2, day 1), with a 4week interval. Radiotherapy was concurrently administered to a total dose of 41.4Gy in 23 fractions. After completion of CRT, transthoracic esophagectomy with extensive lymphadenectomy (>D2) was performed. Result(s): Thirty-three patients (pts) were enrolled in this study between July 2010 and June 2011, and 2 were determined to be ineligible. Characteristics of the 31 eligible patients included a median age of 63 years (range, 40-73 years), male/female ratio of 28/3, PS 0/1 distribution of 19/12, and cStage IIA/IIB/III distribution of 2/10/19. In total, 31 patients (100%) underwent NeoCRT, and 25 (81%) underwent surgery; 1patient (3%) did not undergo surgery due to disease progression. Among the patients who underwent surgery, there was 1 treatment-related death. After 54.3 month of follow up time, 9 patients had recurred in regional only (2pts) and with any distant lesion (7pts).

1842,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment. BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded
1527,"Contrast-enhanced ultrasound detects type II endoleaks during follow-up for endovascular aneurysm repair. Objective: Repeated computed tomography angiography (CTA) can be used during follow-up visits for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) but leads to accumulated radiation exposure and may cause renal impairment. Therefore, the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has increased, and its ability to detect endoleaks has been promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS vs CTA for endoleak detection during EVAR follow-up. Method(s): Ninety-two patients with planned EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm were prospectively, consecutively enrolled. In total, 233 paired CTA and CEUS procedures were performed within the same day. Follow-up visits occurred 1 month, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months postoperatively. Result(s): Of 48 endoleaks discovered by CTA, 39 were also detected on CEUS, giving an overall sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 98.9%. All undetected endoleaks were minor, without clinical importance, and occurred in patients with high body mass index. Conclusion(s): In this study, CEUS was accurate for detecting type II endoleaks during follow-up visits for EVAR. Sensitivity was lower in obese patients.

3642,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial. Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography (CTCA) using prospective ECG-triggering for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Method(s): Thirty patients (19 male, 11 female, mean age 58.8+/-9.9 years) underwent low dose CTCA and invasive coronary angiography (CA) (median 2 days (0, 41)). Before CT scanning, intravenous beta-blocker was administered in 18/30 patients as heart rate (HR) was >65 beats per minute (bpm), achieving a mean HR of 55.7+/-7.9 bpm. CAD was defined as coronary artery narrowing >=50%, using CA as standard of reference. On an intention-to-diagnose-base all non-evaluative segments were included in the analysis.

2124,"Clinical features of photodamaged human skin are associated with a reduction in collagen VII. Chronically sun-exposed or photodamaged human skin is characterized by a number of clinical features, including wrinkles. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie these features. We investigated the hypothesis that the mechanism of wrinkle formation may involve loss of anchoring fibrils, composed mainly of collagen VII, which are important in maintaining dermal-epidermal junction integrity. Ten volunteers with moderate to severe photodamage of dorsal forearm skin were recruited to the study. Using immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and in situ hybridization, we compared collagen VII protein and mRNA content of photodamaged forearm skin with that of sun-protected hip and upper inner arm skin from the same subjects. Numbers of anchoring fibrils per linear microns of basement membrane (mean +/- SEM) were significantly lower in photodamaged skin (1.79 +/- 0.10) as compared with sun-protected hip (2.28 +/- 0.11) and upper inner arm skin (2.21 +/- 0.10) (P < 0.01), and similarly keratinocyte expression of collagen VII mRNA, quantitated as number of positively stained keratinocytes per high power field, was significantly reduced in photodamaged skin (6.3 +/- 2.5) as compared with sun-protected hip (20.0 +/- 5.6) and upper inner arm skin (17.7 +/- 4.9) (P < 0.001). Semiquantitative assessment of immunohistochemical staining for collagen VII showed a non-significant reduction in photodamaged skin as compared with sun-protected skin. We propose that reduced content of collagen VII in photodamaged skin contributes to wrinkle formation by weakening the bond between the dermis and epidermis.",Excluded
2688,"Chromosome aberrations induced by tritiated water or 60Co gamma-rays at early pronuclear stage in mouse eggs. The induction of chromosome aberrations in mouse eggs by exposure to HTO beta-particles and 60Co gamma-rays at the early pronuclear stage was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase by using an in vitro fertilization technique. Eggs at the pronuclear stage were exposed to beta-particles in a chemically defined medium containing tritiated water (HTO) for 2 h at 3-5 h after insemination. Other eggs at the same stage were exposed to gamma-rays from 60Co during the same period. The dose-response relationships for frequencies of chromosome aberrations per egg were fitted to a linear-quadratic model for HTO beta-particles, and to a linear model for 60Co gamma-rays. The chromosome aberrations were mainly chromosome-type, and the majority of all aberrations were fragments. RBE values of HTO beta-particles relative to 60Co gamma-rays and acute X-rays, which were estimated from the ratio of the linear regression coefficients over 0.05-Gy range, were 2.0 and 1.6, respectively.",Excluded
1927,"The effects of post-radiation education pamphlet on self-efficacy in cancer patients. Cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy often experience anxiety and a sense of loss of control immediately after completion of their active treatment. This study aims to evaluate, using a cross-sectional survey, the effects of a post-radiation education pamphlet on the self-efficacy of cancer patients in terms of seeking/understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. Forty-eight patients from various age groups with a variety of cancer diagnoses were recruited from the Radiation Medicine Program at Princess Margaret Hospital. Descriptive analysis of 35 survey responses suggests that the pamphlet improved patient self-efficacy in terms of seeking and understanding medical information, seeking support, and coping with radiation side effects. The benefits of the pamphlet were also found to be independent of patients' education level. Despite the small sample size, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of the education pamphlet in improving patient self-efficacy and gives support to the pamphlet's utility in improving the transition care of cancer patients finishing radiotherapy. In parallel, 40 Princess Margaret Hospital Radiation Medicine Program staff members were also asked, via online surveys, about their awareness of the pamphlet, and its usefulness in terms of content, format, and timing of the information provided. More than 90% of the staff indicated that the pamphlet was an effective tool. Only 57% of oncologists were aware of the pamphlet's existence. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2368,"Potential for radiation dose savings in abdominal and chest CT using automatic tube voltage selection in combination with automatic tube current modulation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous use of automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) for abdominal and chest CT examinations regarding radiation dose reduction and image quality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 617 patients who all underwent contrast-enhanced chest or abdominal CT and divided them into two groups. In group A, 317 patients who underwent CT with only ATCM and a fixed body mass index-adjusted tube voltage (120 kV or 100 kV) were enrolled. In group B, both ATCM and ATVS were used. Image attenuation and noise were measured in different anatomic regions., RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of abdomen and chest CT was higher in group B compared with group A (p < 0.0001). In total, the effective radiation doses for abdomen and chest CT examinations were significantly reduced in group B by 18% compared with group A (p < 0.0001). When only examining those who benefited from the ATVS tool, a dose reduction of 35% for chest CT and 42% for abdomen CT could be achieved (p < 0.0001 for each)., CONCLUSION: The simultaneous use of ATVS and ATCM enables significant radiation dose reduction in abdominal and thoracic contrast-enhanced CT examinations compared with the use of ATCM alone.",Excluded

The most important driver for Black South Africans to use sun protection was whether they were aware of skin cancer (OR: 2.6 for those who were aware versus those who were not, P < 0.0001). Sunscreen was preferred by respondents in LSM 8-10 whereas people in the lowest group (LSM 1-4) favored shade, umbrellas and hats.

3587,"A comparison of leg length discrepancy with function and satisfaction scores after cemented total hip replacement. Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side.

2553,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry. BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk., CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy)., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.

2758,"3D histomorphometric quantification of trabecular bones by computed microtomography using synchrotron radiation. Conventional bone histomorphometry is an important method for quantitative evaluation of bone microstructure. X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved. The results obtained could be used in forming the basis for comparison of the bone microarchitecture and can be a valuable tool for predicting bone fragility. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

2713,"Achieving routine submillisievert CT scanning: report from the summit on management of radiation dose in CT. This Special Report presents the consensus of the Summit on Management of Radiation Dose in Computed Tomography (CT) (held in February 2011), which brought together participants from academia, clinical practice, industry, and regulatory and funding agencies to identify the steps required to reduce the effective dose from routine CT examinations to less than 1 mSv. The most promising technologies and methods discussed at the summit include innovations and developments in x-ray sources; detectors; and image reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms. Access to raw projection data and standard data sets for algorithm validation and optimization is a clear need, as is the need for new, clinically relevant metrics of image quality and diagnostic performance. Current commercially available techniques such as automatic exposure control, optimization of tube potential, beam-shaping filters, and dynamic z-axis collimators are important, and education to successfully implement these methods routinely is critically needed. Other methods that are just becoming widely available, such as iterative reconstruction, noise reduction, and postprocessing algorithms, will also have an important role. Together, these existing techniques can reduce dose by a factor of two to four. Technical advances that show considerable promise for additional dose reduction but are several years or more from commercial availability include compressed sensing, volume of interest and interior tomography techniques, and photon-counting detectors. This report offers a strategic roadmap for the CT user and research and manufacturer communities toward routinely achieving effective doses of less than 1 mSv, which is well below the average annual dose from naturally occurring sources of radiation.",Excluded

2682,"Comprehensive toxicity risk profiling in radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: A new concept for individually optimised treatment. Background and purpose: A comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile is needed to improve radiation treatment optimisation, minimising toxicity burden, in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. We aimed to develop and externally validate NTCP models for various toxicities at multiple time points. Material(s) and Method(s): Using logistic regression, we determined the relationship between normal tissue irradiation and the risk of 22 toxicities at ten time points during and after treatment in 750 HNC patients. The toxicities involved swallowing, salivary, mucosal, speech, pain and general complaints. Studied predictors included patient, tumour and treatment characteristics and dose parameters of 28 organs. The resulting NTCP models were externally validated in 395 HNC patients. Result(s): The NTCP models involved 14 organs that were associated with at least one toxicity. The oral cavity was the predominant organ, associated with 12 toxicities. Other important organs included the parotid and submandibular glands, buccal mucosa and swallowing muscles. In addition, baseline toxicity, treatment modality, and tumour site were common predictors of toxicity. The median discrimination performance (AUC) of the models was 0.71 (interquartile range: 0.68-0.75) at internal validation and 0.67 (interquartile range: 0.62-0.71) at external validation. Conclusion(s): We established a comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile that provides essential insight into how radiation exposure of various organs translates into multiple acute and late toxicities. This comprehensive understanding of radiation-induced toxicities enables a new radiation treatment optimisation concept that balances multiple toxicity risks simultaneously and minimises the overall toxicity burden for an individual HNC patient who needs to undergo radiation treatment.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Excluded
2974,"The effect of exposure duration on the biological activity of mobile telephony radiation. In the present experiments we studied the effects of different durations of a single (continuous), daily exposure, ranging from 1 min up to 21 min, to the two established systems of digital mobile telephony radiation that are commonly used in Europe, viz. GSM 900 MHz (Global System for Mobile telecommunications) and DCS 1800 MHz (Digital Cellular System-referred to also as GSM 1800 MHz), on a well-tested biological model, the reproductive capacity of the insect Drosophila melanogaster. The insects were exposed to each type of radiation at an intensity of about 10 microW/cm(2), corresponding to a distance of 20 or 30 cm from the antenna of a DCS 1800 or a GSM 900 mobile phone handset, respectively. At these distances the bioactivity of mobile telephony radiation was found to be at a maximum due to the existence of a ""window"" of increased bioactivity around this value, as we have shown recently [1-4]. The results show that the reproductive capacity decreases almost linearly with increasing exposure duration to both GSM 900 and DCS 1800 radiation, suggesting that short-term exposures to these radiations have cumulative effects on living organisms. Additionally, our results show again that GSM 900 MHz radiation is slightly more bioactive than DCS 1800 MHz radiation, at the same exposure durations and under equal radiation intensities, as shown in our previous experiments [5].

3154,"Pembrolizumab with or without radiotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a pooled analysis of two randomised trials. Background: Radiotherapy might augment systemic antitumoral responses to immunotherapy. In the PEMBRO-RT (phase 2) and MDACC (phase 1/2) trials, patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly allocated immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) with or without radiotherapy. When the trials were analysed individually, a potential benefit was noted in the combination treatment arm. However, owing to the small sample size of each trial, differences in response rates and outcomes were not statistically significant but remained clinically notable. We therefore did a pooled analysis to infer whether radiotherapy improves responses to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Method(s): Inclusion criteria for the PEMBRO-RT and MDACC trials were patients (aged >=18 years) with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and at least one unirradiated lesion to monitor for out-of-field response. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients had previously received chemotherapy, whereas in the MDACC trial, patients could be either previously treated or newly diagnosed. Patients in both trials were immunotherapy-naive. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by smoking status (<10 vs >=10 pack-years). In the MDACC trial, patients were entered into one of two cohorts based on radiotherapy schedule feasibility and randomly assigned (1:1). Because of the nature of the intervention in the combination treatment arm, blinding to radiotherapy was not feasible in either trial. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously (200 mg every 3 weeks) with or without radiotherapy in both trials. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, the first dose of pembrolizumab was given sequentially less than 1 week after the last dose of radiotherapy (24 Gy in three fractions), whereas in the MDACC trial, pembrolizumab was given concurrently with the first dose of radiotherapy (50 Gy in four fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions). Only unirradiated lesions were measured for response. The endpoints for this pooled analysis were best out-of-field (abscopal) response rate (ARR), best abscopal disease control rate (ACR), ARR at 12 weeks, ACR at 12 weeks, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The intention-to-treat populations from both trials were included in analyses. The PEMBRO-RT trial (NCT02492568) and the MDACC trial (NCT02444741) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Finding(s): Overall, 148 patients were included in the pooled analysis, 76 of whom had been assigned pembrolizumab and 72 who had been assigned pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy. Median follow-up for all patients was 33 months (IQR 32.4-33.6). 124 (84%) of 148 patients had non-squamous histological features and 111 (75%) had previously received chemotherapy. Baseline variables did not differ between treatment groups, including PD-L1 status and metastatic disease volume. The most frequently irradiated sites were lung metastases (28 of 72 [39%]), intrathoracic lymph nodes (15 of 72 [21%]), and lung primary disease (12 of 72 [17%]). Best ARR was 19.7% (15 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 41.7% (30 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR] 2.96, 95% CI 1.42-6.20; p=0.0039), and best ACR was 43.4% (33 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 65.3% (47 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (2.51, 1.28-4.91; p=0.0071). Median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (IQR 2.9-5.9) with pembrolizumab alone versus 9.0 months (6.8-11.2) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99; p=0.045), and median overall survival was 8.7 months (6.4-11.0) with pembrolizumab versus 19.2 months (14.6-23.8) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (0.67, 0.54-0.84; p=0.0004). No new safety concerns were noted in the pooled analysis. Interpretation(s): Adding radiotherapy to pembrolizumab immunotherapy significantly increased responses and outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. These results warrant validation in a randomised phase 3 trial. Funding(s): Merck Sharp & Dohme.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

The incidence of bone sarcomas among 3055 female radium-dial workers who entered the dial industry before 1950 was used to determine dose-response relationships for the induction of bone sarcomas by radium. Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement.

32,"In vitro effects of simulated microgravity on Sertoli cell function. With the advent of space flights questions concerning the effects of microgravity (0G) on human reproductive physiology have received great attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of 0G on Sertoli cells. A Sertoli cell line from mouse testis (42GPA9) was analyzed for cytoskeletal and Sex Hormone Binding Globilin (SHBG) changes by immunohistochemistry, for antioxidant content by RT-PCR and for culture medium lactate concentrations by protein chemistry. Cells were cultured for 6, 24 and 48 h on a three-dimensional Random Positioning Machine (3D-RPM); static controls (1G) were positioned on the supporting frame. At the end of each experiment, cultured cells were either fixed in paraformaldehyde or lysed and RNA-extracted or used for culture medium lactate measurements as needed. At 0G, Sertoli cytoskeleton became disorganized, microtubules fragmented and SHBG undetectable already after 24 h, with alterations worsening by 48 h. It was evident that various antioxidant systems appreciably increased during the first 24 h but significantly decreased at 48 h. No changes occurred in the 1G samples. Initially, 0G seemed to disturb antioxidant protection strategies allowing the testes to support sperm production, thus generating an aging-like state of oxidative stress. Lactate production at 0G slightly decreased after 24 h. Further experiments are needed in space to investigate upon steroidogenesis and germ cell differentiation within the testis, to rule out male infertility as a possible consequence, which could be a problem, as life expectancy increases. 2010 COSPAR.

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of differing light doses. Patients with HGD in BE received oral ALA (60 mg/kg) activated by low (500 J/cm), medium (750 J/cm), high (1,000 J/cm), or highest (1,000 J/cm x2) light dose at 635 nm. Follow-up was by regular endoscopy with quadrantic biopsies. Twenty-four patients were treated. Successful eradication of HGD was significantly correlated with light dose (log rank, p < 0.01). Six of eight patients (75%) treated with the highest light dose, one of two treated with high dose (50%), two of nine (22%) receiving medium light dose, and zero of five receiving low light dose had successful eradication of HGD (median follow-up 45 months, range 1-78 months). No skin photosensitivity or esophageal strictures occurred. The efficacy of ALA-PDT for eradication of HGD in BE is closely related to the light dose used. With a drug dose of 60 mg/kg and light at 635 nm, we recommend a minimum light dose of 1,000 J/cm of esophagus. This dose appears safe.",Excluded
292,"Phase II study of preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost for rectal cancer.

In addition, it is associated with considerable toxicity. As an alternative strategy, we explored prospectively, preoperative helical tomotherapy with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 108 patients were treated with intensity-modulated and image-guided radiotherapy using the Tomotherapy Hi-Art II system. A dose of 46 Gy, in daily fractions of 2 Gy, was delivered to the mesorectum and draining lymph nodes, without concomitant chemotherapy. Patients with an anticipated circumferential resection margin (CRM) of less than 2 mm, based on magnetic resonance imaging, received a SIB to the tumor up to a total dose of 55.2 Gy. Acute and late side effects were scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0., RESULTS: A total of 102 patients presented with cT3-4 tumors; 57 patients entered the boost group and 51 the no-boost group. One patient in the no-boost group developed a radio-hypersensitivity reaction, resulting in a complete tumor remission, a Grade 3 acute and Grade 5 late enteritis. No other Grade >=3 acute toxicities occurred. With a median follow-up of 32 months, Grade >=3 late gastrointestinal and urinary toxicity were observed in 6% and 4% of the patients, respectively.

A comparable amount of patients were asymptomatic or reported symptom improvement after repeat ablation in both groups (80% (80/100) in group 1 and 77% (446/576) in group 2; p = 0.57). Conclusion(s): Repeat ablation for AF in elderly patients can be performed with safety and efficacy comparable to younger patients.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
425,"[COMBINED USE OF INTERFERON-GAMMA RELEASE ASSAY AND LOW-DOSE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY FOR TUBERCULOSIS SCREENING PROGRAM OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS]. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of the interferon-gamma release assays and low-dose computed tomography for the pulmonary tuberculosis screenings program of health care workers., DESIGN: For the pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) screenings program, T-SPOT.TB (one of interferon-gamma release assays: IGRA) were performed on 332 health care workers (HCWs) with normal chest roentgenogram and without the history of TB treatment. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) was also performed on IGRA positive HCWs., RESULTS: Ten of 332 subjects were positive IGRA. LDCT was performed on IGRA positive 10 subjects. Abnormal findings were noted in 2 of 10 subjects by LDCT. One had CT findings compatible with active TB and finally diagnosed as active TB. Another had scarring shadow at right S5 and lingular segment. Nine of 10 IGRA positive subjects were judged as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Three hundred twenty-one subjects with negative and borderline IGRA of 332 HCWs were judged as not infected with TB., CONCLUSION: Combined use of IGRA and LDCT for tuberculosis screening program of HCWs was found to be effective for early diagnosis of TB, accurate diagnosis of LTBI and judgment of non-infective subjects.",Excluded
2686,"Novel mutation in keratin 10 causing autosomal dominant epidermolytic ichthyosis. Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI; OMIM 113800), previously termed bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma or epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of keratinization caused by mutations in either of the KRT1 or KRT10 genes, which encode the suprabasal keratins K1 and K10, respectively. The condition is usually characterized clinically by severe neonatal erythroderma, blistering and fragile skin, with the subsequent development of generalized hyperkeratosis. Usually mutations are missense substitutions in the highly conserved alpha-helical rod domains of these keratins, which play a critical role in filament formation. The presence of palmoplantar keratoderma is suggestive of KRT1 mutations, whereas KRT10 mutations are associated with palmoplantar sparing. We report a seven-generation kindred with EI due to a novel mutation in KRT10. A 32-year-old woman presented with widespread ichthyosis and erythema affecting her trunk and limbs. She gave a history of scaling and erythroderma since birth but no blistering, erosions or collodion membrane. She had been maintained on oral isotretinoin 20-40 mg once daily from the age of 13 years, but had recently developed lower-back and hip pain. Examination revealed widespread fine scaling and erythema over the trunk and limbs with more significant hyperkeratosis at the elbows, knees and ankles. There was relative sparing of the palmoplantar skin. Her father, uncle and grandmother were more severely affected, but none was receiving oral retinoids. Four further generations were recorded as affected. Histology of affected elbow and upper-arm skin demonstrated acanthosis, marked overlying hyperkeratosis, vacuolar change of the upper epidermal cells in the upper epidermis with prominent clumping of keratohyaline granules and abnormal eosinophilic cytoplasm. X-rays of the lower lumbar spine and left hip demonstrated bridging osteophytes T11-L1 and flattening of the left femoral head, with magnetic resonance imaging confirming the presence of avascular necrosis. This required treatment with a left core decompression of the left hip, with good results. Mutation screening of KRT10 identified a novel heterozygous deletion extending from intron 5 into exon 6 (designated K10 c.1156-79- 1243del), abolishing the exon 6 acceptor splice site, resulting in a shorter aberrant K10 protein lacking a sequence motif critically important for keratin filament assembly. The mutation was present in her affected father. This finding adds to the evidence that K10 mutations are the principal cause of autosomal dominant EI with palmoplantar sparing. It also highlights the possible side-effects of long-term oral retinoid treatment in these inherited conditions.",Excluded
1402,"Impacts of antibiotics on in vitro UVA-susceptibility of human skin fibroblasts. Many studies of UVA-induced cell damage use skin cells obtained during plastic surgery. As the skin is contaminated by micro-organisms, antibiotics need to be added to primary skin cell culture media. This study analysed the impact of the most widely used agents, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B deoxycholate (amB), on UVA-irradiated human skin fibroblasts. The results show that the presence of amB in cell culture media increases the susceptibility of fibroblasts to UVA and the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, even when cells are irradiated in amB-free saline. This photosensitising effect of amB can be prevented if the antifungal agent is removed from the culture medium at least 24 hours before irradiation. Moreover, the use of streptomycin during cell culture partly protects cells against the UVA-induced mortality linked to amB. Acellular tests on lipid micelles suggest that this protective effect could result from an inhibition of lipid peroxidation by the antibacterial agent. In conclusion, antibiotics should be used with care in cell culture media if the cells are to be used in physiological studies of fine mechanisms in UVA-susceptibility of skin cells. In other cases, cells should be maintained in antibiotic-free media for 24 hours before irradiation.",Excluded
1893,"CT-guided screw fixation of vertical sacral fractures in local anaesthesia using a standard CT. PURPOSE: To evaluate time efficiency, radiation dose, precision and complications of percutaneous iliosacral screw placement under CT-guidance in local anaesthesia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 143 interventions in 135 patients during a period of 42 months. Implant failures could be evaluated in 85/182 screws and bony healing or refracturing in 46/182 screws., RESULTS: A total of 182 iliosacral screw placements in 179 vertical sacral fractures (105 unilateral, 37 bilateral) took place in 135 patients. 166/179 of the sacral fractures were detected in Denis zone 1,10 in Denis zone 2 and 3 in Denis zone 3. No screw misplacements including the simultaneous bilateral procedures were noted. The average time for a unilateral screw placement was 23 minutes (range: 14 -52 minutes) and 35 minutes (range: 21 - 60 minutes) for simultaneous bilateral screwing. The dose length product was 365 mGy x cm (range: 162 - 1014 mGy x cm) for the unilateral and 470 mGy x cm (range: 270 - 1271 mGy x cm) for the bilateral procedure. 1 gluteal bleeding occurred as the only acute minor complication (0.7 %). Fracture healing was verified with follow-up CTs in 42/46 sacral fractures after screw placement. Backing out occurred in 12/85 screws between 6 and 69 days after intervention. In 8 patients contralateral stress fractures were detected after unilateral screw placement between day 10 and 127 (average: 48 days)., CONCLUSION: CT-guided iliosacral screw placement in sacral fractures is a safe tool providing a very high precision. The radiation dose is in the order of a diagnostic CT of the pelvis for both unilateral and bilateral screws. Contralateral stress fractures in unilateral screw placements have to be considered during the first weeks after intervention. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.",Excluded
3410,"Postcontrast T1 Mapping for Differential Diagnosis of Recurrence and Radionecrosis after Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Brain Metastasis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence in brain metastases is challenging. We investigated the diagnostic efficiency of postcontrast T1 mapping in solving this problem., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between March 2016 and June 2017, fifty-six patients with brain metastases who underwent contrast-enhanced cerebral T1 mapping were recruited for this prospective study. The findings revealed new enhancement after gamma knife radiosurgery. The subjects were assigned to radionecrosis and recurrence groups based on follow-up (median, 11.5 months) and histopathologic results. T1 values of lesions 5 (T15min) and 60 (T160min) minutes after administration of contrast agent and their difference (T1differ) were compared between the 2 groups with the 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the optimum cutoff values for differential diagnosis., RESULTS: There were significant differences between the 2 groups in T15min, T160min, and T1differ values (P = .012, P = .004, and P < .001, respectively). Relative to T15min and T160min, T1differ exhibited greater sensitivity and specificity (P < .001, respectively) in identifying radionecrosis. The optimum T1differ value for differential diagnosis was 71.1 ms (area under the curve = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00), with sensitivity and specificity of 81.5% and 96.5%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Postcontrast T1 mapping is optimal for the differential diagnosis of radionecrosis and tumor recurrence. Among T1 parameters, T1differ is the most powerful parameter for differential diagnosis. Advantages in terms of quantitative analysis and high resolution portend the wide use of postcontrast T1 mapping in the future. Copyright © 2018 by American Journal of Neuroradiology.",Excluded
2816,"Efficacy and safety of single-session argon plasma coagulation in the management of chronic radiation proctitis. Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP) manifests as rectal bleeding 12 to 24 months after pelvic radiotherapy. No criterion standard of treatment has been established, although argon plasma coagulation (APC) has increasingly become the treatment of choice. Previous studies have applied APC over multiple sessions, necessitating increased numbers of treatments. Objective(s): To assess the safety and efficacy of large-volume APC application in the treatment of CRP with the intention of a single-session treatment protocol. Design(s): Prospective study. Setting(s): Tertiary referral hospital. Patient(s): Over an 8-year period, consecutive patients with CRP with rectal bleeding were prospectively enrolled. Intervention(s): Large-volume APC application to affected rectal mucosa. Main Outcome Measurements: Number of treatments, bleeding scores, complications. Result(s): Fifty patients (mean age 72.1 years; range 51-87 years) were treated; 45 were men (prostate cancer). The mean period between radiotherapy and initial APC treatment was 23 months (range 4-140 months). Seventeen (34%) patients had grade A endoscopic severity, 23 (46%) grade B, and 10 (20%) grade C. Other therapies failed in 16 (32%) patients. The mean number of treatments was 1.36 (range 1-3) with a mean follow-up of 20.6 months (range 6-48 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients were successfully treated after 1 session and 96% after 2 sessions. Bleeding scores improved in all patients (P < .001). Seventeen (34%) patients experienced short-term, self-limiting complications; 1 (2%) patient experienced a long-term complication. Limitation(s): Nonrandomized study. Conclusion(s): Large-volume APC treatment was successful in the treatment of CRP, including those in whom other therapies had previously failed, and resulted in a decreased number of treatments compared with other published studies. The benefits were offset by an increased incidence of short-term complications but no increase in long-term complications. © 2010 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",Excluded
3544,"CT for evaluation of urolithiasis: image quality of ultralow-dose (Sub mSv) CT with knowledge-based iterative reconstruction and diagnostic performance of low-dose CT with statistical iterative reconstruction. Purpose: To compare radiation dose and image quality in regular, low, and ultralow-dose CT protocols, and to evaluate diagnostic performance of low-dose CT for urolithiasis. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-five patients with suspected urolithiasis underwent three different scans under the regular, low, and ultralow-dose protocols. The regular dose scans were reconstructed using filtered back projection and the low-dose scans were reconstructed using a statistical iterative reconstruction. The ultralow-dose scans were reconstructed using both techniques in addition to a knowledge-based IR. Effective radiation doses were compared. Objective image noise was assessed by measuring standard deviation of HU and subjective image assessment was performed with a 3- or 5-point scale. Diagnostic performance of the low-dose image was evaluated, using the regular dose image as a standard reference and the interobserver agreement between two reviewers with different levels of experience was calculated. Result(s): The effective radiation dose was significantly different in each protocol (p < 0.001) and estimated dose reduction of the low-dose and ultralow-dose protocols was 76.4% and 89.8%, respectively. The knowledge-based iterative reconstruction algorithm showed poorer subjective image quality than the regular and low-dose protocols, but it also had the least objective image noise. Overall, the low-dose image set showed a greater than 84% concordance rate and 100% in ureter stones larger than 3 mm. Interobserver agreement was substantial (kappa value = 0.61). Conclusion(s): The knowledge-based IR can provide a better quality image while reducing radiation exposure under the same protocol. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the low-dose CT protocol is comparable to the regular dose scan.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
572,"Treatment response in glass vs resin radioembolization of nonresectable hepatic metastasis. Purpose: To compare treatment response between glass and resin yttrium-90 (90Y) microsphere radioembolization of hepatic metastasis from colorectal and other systemic malignancies. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis was performed on 70 patients with hepatic metastasis treated with glass or resin 90Y radioembolization from 2008 to 2014 at an academic medical center. Up to 2 treated lesions per lobe were measured using cross-sectional imaging in the X, Y, and Z planes at baseline and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Response was evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Result(s): A total of 70 patients were evaluated with 39 (56%) receiving resin and 31 (44%) receiving glass particles. Of those, 34 (49%) patients had metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a mean MELD score of 8.5 (SD 2.1), and 36 (51%) had other primary malignancies with a mean MELD score of 7.7 (SD 1.7). Thirty-seven (53%) patients were female with a mean age of 59.7 years (SD 12.3) at treatment 1. Patients received an average radiation dose of 1.12 gigabecquerel (GBq) (SD 0.33) with resin treatments, compared to 3.08 GBq (SD 1.09) with glass treatments. Evaluation of (Table presented) tumor response using WHO criteria found 1 (2.6%) patient had a complete response (CR), 13 (33.3%) had partial responses (PR), 19 (48.7%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (15.4%) had progressive disease (PD) when treated with resin particles, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 5 (16.1%) had PR, 21 (67.7%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass particles. RECIST 1.1 response criteria demonstrated 1 (2.6%) patient had CR, 13 (33.3%) had PR, 18 (46.2%) had SD, and 7 (17.9%) had PD when treated with resin, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 7 (22.6%) had PR, 19 (61.3%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass (Table 1). Due to small sample sizes, we were unable to perform formal significance testing on the distribution of response by treatment type. Conclusion(s): Although both glass and resin 90Y microspheres are efficacious treatments for nonresectable metastatic hepatic disease, there is limited data on direct comparison of imaging response between the 2 treatment types. Our study demonstrates that resin-based 90Y therapy offers a comparable response when compared to glassbased 90Y therapy at nearly one-third the dose of radiation.",Excluded
2945,"Clinical and lung ultrasonographic features of transient tachypnea of newborn in a tertiary care hospital in Bangalore. Introduction: Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) also called wet lung, occurs due to delayed clearance of lung fluid. The diagnosis of TTN was primarily based on medical history, clinical manifestations, arterial blood gas analysis, and chest radiography (CXR). It is estimated that over 70% of infants with TTN are clinically misdiagnosed with Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung ultrasound (LUS) is an emerging technique that could be used for early detection of TTN. This study aims to evaluate the value of lung ultrasound in the diagnosis of TTN in late-preterm and full-term neonates. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty five late preterm and term neonates with signs of respiratory distress were included in this prospective observational study from January 2016 to June 2017. Lung ultrasound was done within the first 24 hours of birth and assessed according to the observation indices like A-line, B-line and Double lung point. Result(s): On lung ultrasound, 53 (81.5%) neonates showed the feature of double lung point (DLP) while 41 (63.1%) neonates showed A-line. The respiratory symptoms subsided in 38 (58.4%) babies at room air while only 2 (3.1%) babies required continuous positive airway pressure ventilation. The DLP feature on LUS was significantly more in babies born to primi mothers than multigravida (p value 0.02) and those delivered through LSCS when compared to babies delivered vaginally (p value-0.01). Conclusion(s): TTN is a self-limiting condition and treatment is mainly supportive. The results of this study further demonstrate that LUS can accurately and reliably diagnose TTN. Therefore, significantly reducing the need for chest X-rays and ultimately result in lower exposure of a neonate to ionizing radiation. This will aid in counselling the parents regarding its benign nature and conservative management. Copyright © 2019, Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2315,"Comparison of the micronucleus and chromosome aberration techniques for the documentation of cytogenetic damage in radiochemotherapy-treated patients with rectal cancer. PURPOSE: The goal of the interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit KFO179 (Biological Basis of Individual Tumor Response in Patients with Rectal Cancer) is to develop an individual Response and Toxicity Score for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. The aim of the present study was to find a reliable and sensitive method with easy scoring criteria and high numbers of cell counts in a short period of time in order to analyze DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Thus, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay and the chromosome aberration technique (CAT) were tested., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 22 patients with rectal cancer before (0 Gy), during (21.6 Gy), and after (50.4 Gy) radiochemotherapy were stimulated in vitro by phytohemagglutinin (PHA); the cultures were then processed for the CBMN assay and the CAT to compare the two methods., RESULTS: A significant increase of chromosomal damage was observed in the course of radiochemotherapy parallel to increasing radiation doses, but independent of the chemotherapy applied. The equivalence of both methods was shown by Westlake's equivalence test., CONCLUSION: The results show that the CBMN assay and the CAT are equivalent. For further investigations, we prefer the CBMN assay, because it is simpler through easy scoring criteria, allows high numbers of cell counts in less time, is reliable, sensitive, and has higher statistical power. In the future, we plan to integrate cytogenetic damage during radiochemotherapy into the planned Response and Toxicity Score within our interdisciplinary Clinical Research Unit.",Excluded
2862,"Feasibility and safety of extended adjuvant temozolomide beyond six cycles for patients with glioblastoma. Introduction: Temozolomide is the first chemotherapeutic agent proven effective for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The drug is well tolerated for its low toxicity. The current standard practice is concomitant chemoradiotherapy for 6 weeks followed by 6 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. Some Caucasian studies have suggested that patients might benefit from extended adjuvant cycles of temozolomide (>6 cycles) to lengthen both progression-free survival and overall survival. In the present study, we compared differences in survival and toxicity profile between patients who received conventional 6-cycle temozolomide and those who received more than 6 cycles of temozolomide. Method(s): Patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without progressive disease and completed concomitant chemoradiotherapy during a 4-year period were studied. Progression-free survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. t Test, U test, and correlation were chosen accordingly to examine the impact of age, extent of resection, MGMT promoter methylation status and adjuvant cycles on progression-free survival. For factors with a P value of <0.05 in univariate analyses, Cox regression hazard model was adopted to determine the strongest factors related to progression-free survival. Result(s): The median progression-free survival was 17.0 months for patients who received 6 cycles of temozolomide (n=7) and 43.4 months for those who received more than 6 cycles (n=7) [P=0.007, log-rank test]. Two patients in the former group and one in the latter group encountered grade 1 toxicity and recovered following dose adjustment. Cycles of adjuvant temozolomide were correlated with progression-free survival (P=0.016, hazard ratio=0.68). Conclusion(s): Extended cycles of temozolomide are safe and feasible for Chinese patients with disease responsive to temozolomide.Copyright © 2017, Hong Kong Academy of Medicine Press.

PURPOSE: To analyze the correlation between municipal esophageal cancer relative risk and municipal residential radon concentration in a high radon emission Spanish area., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an ecological study at municipal level in Galicia, Spain. For each municipality we estimated the median radon concentration and the relative risk (RR) for esophageal cancer mortality for males and females. The relative risk was calculated using a Bayesian approach. Homes with data on radon concentration were selected through stratified random sampling. To be included, each municipality had to have at least five radon measurements. We obtained Spearman's correlations for median residential radon concentration and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males and females, separately., RESULTS: We included 129 municipalities, covering the 79% of Galician population. 14% of municipalities had radon concentrations above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) action level. We found a statistically significant correlation among residential radon and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males (p < 0.001), but not for females. When the analysis was restricted to municipalities with more than 15 radon measurements the correlation pattern remained., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study analyzing the association between residential radon and esophageal cancer. The results suggesting a possible effect of residential radon on esophageal cancer mortality should be explored through more robust epidemiological designs such as case-control studies.",Excluded
1295,"Pretreatment MRI radiomics analysis allows for reliable prediction of local recurrence in non-metastatic T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Background: To identify a radiomics signature to predict local recurrence in patients with non-metastatic T4 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): A total of 737 patients from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (training cohort: n = 360; internal validation cohort: n = 120)and Wuzhou Red Cross Hospital (external validation cohort: n = 257)underwent feature extraction from the largest axial area of the tumor on pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging scans. Feature selection was based on the prognostic performance and feature stability in the training cohort. Radscores were generated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model with the selected features in the training cohort and then validated in the internal and external validation cohorts. We also constructed a nomogram for predicting local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Finding(s): Eleven features were selected to construct the Radscore, which was significantly associated with LRFS. For the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, the Radscore (C-index: 0.741 vs. 0.753 vs. 0.730)outperformed clinical prognostic variables (C-index for primary gross tumor volume: 0.665 vs. 0.672 vs. 0.577; C-index for age: 0.571 vs. 0.629 vs. 0.605)in predicting LRFS. The generated radiomics nomogram, which integrated the Radscore and clinical variables, exhibited a satisfactory prediction performance (C-index: 0.810 vs. 0.807 vs. 0.753). The nomogram-defined high-risk group had a shorter LRFS than did the low-risk group (5-year LRFS: 73.6% vs. 95.3%, P <.001; 79.6% vs 95.8%, P =.006; 85.7% vs 96.7%, P =.005).

The present study reports the clinical outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastasis (OM) originating from various tumors. Between February 2012 and April 2017, 40 patients with unresectable OM were treated with SBRT. Of these patients, 92% showed a solitary nodal metastasis and the rest had up to three metas-tases. The dose prescription was 50 Gy in 10 fractions with three-dimensional conformal techniques or volumetric inten-sity-modulated arc therapy. Median follow-up was 14 months. Of the 40 patients, none showed local progression at the site of SBRT, but 20 patients showed tumor growth at distant sites during follow-up. The 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 45.1 and 36.1%, respectively. The 2- and 3-year progression-free survival rates were 35.4 and 26.5%, respectively. The interval between diagnosis and detection of OM (<2 vs. >2 years) and primary tumor site (esophagus vs. others) emerged as significant variables affecting survival. Grade 3 subacute and grade 4 chronic toxicities were observed in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. SBRT of 50 Gy in 10 fractions for OM from various primary tumors was shown to lead to good clinical outcomes from the viewpoints of local control and toxicity frequency.

1135,"Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus: A retrospective analysis. Purpose: To report the clinical features and outcome of patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus following radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis was performed on 15 patients referred to Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute between 1981 to 1998 with primary adenocarcinoma of the anus. The median follow-up was 7.5 years. Six patients underwent treatment with curative intent - either chemoradiation or radiotherapy alone. Surgery was mainly limited to either incisional or excisional biopsy. The remaining nine patients were treated with palliative intent because of advanced age, advanced disease, or poor medical status. The biological equivalent doses were calculated for all patients and correlated with time to progression. Result(s): None of the curative group had relapsed after a median follow-up of 6.6 years. All except one were alive and well. No patient developed any serious long-term toxicity and all patients avoided colostomy. All patients managed with palliative intent died with persistent locoregional disease with a median survival of 0.8 year. Conclusion(s): Primary adenocarcinoma of the anus is a very rare disease that precludes a rigorous analysis. This study demonstrates that radiation and in particular chemoradiation are effective therapies consistent with other recent series and analogous to squamous cell carcinomas of the anus. It also emphasizes the poor prognosis of patients treated with palliative intent.",Excluded
2890,"Tumour size in cancer of the cervix. In a randomized trial comprising 204 patients with operable cervical carcinomas stages I and II, two low-dose rates in gynaecological brachytherapy were compared. Treatment consisted of Cs-137 uterovaginal application followed by surgery (either immediate or delayed). The results for the two dose rates have been published previously. The present paper concerns the correlation between outcome and tumour size. Tumour size was carefully estimated in two ways: by clinical examination under general anaesthesia and by measurements on the customized vaginal mould used for the brachytherapy. Ninety-one patients (45%) were classified as stage I, and 113 were classified as stage II proximal. The mean tumour size was 39 mm (range 15-64 mm). Cox's multivariate analysis indicated that the factors with a poor prognostic value were for survival: node involvement (N +) (p < 0.001), large tumour size (T +) (p < 0.001) and involvement of the endocervix (E +) (p <0.01); for event-free survival: N + (p <0.001), T + (p < 0.001); for local control; N + (p = 0.0001); for metastasis and regional relapse: N + (p < 0.001) and T + (p < 0.001). Stage was not a prognostic factor over the present range in either univariate or multivariate analysis. In this series tumour size is a powerful independent prognostic factor. It is therefore suggested that for the classification of cervical cancer and the indications for surgical staging and adjuvant treatment, tumour size should be taken into account.",Excluded
325,"Improving adjuvant therapy for rectal cancer by combining protracted-infusion fluorouracil with radiation therapy after curative surgery. BACKGROUND: The combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy with fluorouracil plus semustine after surgery has been established as an effective approach to decreasing the risk of tumor relapse and improving survival in patients with rectal cancer who are at high risk for relapse or death. We sought to determine whether the efficacy of chemotherapy could be improved by administering fluorouracil by protracted infusion throughout the duration of radiation therapy and whether the omission of semustine would reduce the toxicity and delayed complications of chemotherapy without decreasing its antitumor efficacy., METHODS: Six hundred sixty patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer received intermittent bolus injections or protracted venous infusions of fluorouracil during postoperative radiation to the pelvis. They also received systemic chemotherapy with semustine plus fluorouracil or with fluorouracil alone in a higher dose, administered before and after the pelvic irradiation., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 46 months among surviving patients, patients who received a protracted infusion of fluorouracil had a significantly increased time to relapse (P = 0.01) and improved survival (P = 0.005). There was no evidence of a beneficial effect in the patients who received semustine plus fluorouracil., CONCLUSIONS: A protracted infusion of fluorouracil during pelvic irradiation improved the effect of combined-treatment postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with high-risk rectal cancer. Semustine plus fluorouracil was not more effective than a higher dose of systemic fluorouracil given alone.",Excluded
1189,"Observer variation in target volume delineation of lung cancer related to radiation oncologist-computer interaction: a 'Big Brother' evaluation. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the process of target volume delineation in lung cancer for optimization of imaging, delineation protocol and delineation software., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven radiation oncologists (observers) from five different institutions delineated the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) including positive lymph nodes of 22 lung cancer patients (stages I-IIIB) on CT only. All radiation oncologist-computer interactions were recorded with a tool called 'Big Brother'. For each radiation oncologist and patient the following issues were analyzed: delineation time, number of delineated points and corrections, zoom levels, level and window (L/W) settings, CT slice changes, use of side windows (coronal and sagittal) and software button use., RESULTS: The mean delineation time per GTV was 16 min (SD 10 min). The mean delineation time for lymph node positive patients was on average 3 min larger (P = 0.02) than for lymph node negative patients. Many corrections (55%) were due to L/W change (e.g. delineating in mediastinum L/W and then correcting in lung L/W). For the lymph node region, a relatively large number of corrections was found (3.7 corr/cm2), indicating that it was difficult to delineate lymph nodes. For the tumor-atelectasis region, a relative small number of corrections was found (1.0 corr/cm2), indicating that including or excluding atelectasis into the GTV was a clinical decision. Inappropriate use of L/W settings was frequently found (e.g. 46% of all delineated points in the tumor-lung region were delineated in mediastinum L/W settings). Despite a large observer variation in cranial and caudal direction of 0.72 cm (1 SD), the coronal and sagittal side windows were not used in 45 and 60% of the cases, respectively. For the more difficult cases, observer variation was smaller when the coronal and sagittal side windows were used., CONCLUSIONS: With the 'Big Brother' tool a method was developed to trace the delineation process. The differences between observers concerning the delineation style were large. This study led to recommendations on how to improve delineation accuracy by adapting the delineation protocol (guidelines for L/W use) and delineation software (double window with lung and mediastinum L/W settings at the same time, enforced use of coronal and sagittal views) and including FDG-PET information (lymph nodes and atelectasis).",Excluded
3079,"Altered senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage response in a mutant p53 model of accelerated aging. The tumor suppressors p16(INK4a) and p53 have been implicated as contributors to age-associated stem cell decline. Key functions of p53 are the induction of cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Here, we examine senescence, apoptosis, and DNA damage responses in a mouse accelerated aging model that exhibits increased p53 activity, the p53(+/m) mouse. Aged tissues of p53(+/m) mice display higher percentages of senescent cells (as determined by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and p16(INK4a) and p21 accumulation) compared to aged tissues from p53(+/+) mice. Surprisingly, despite having enhanced p53 activity, p53(+/m) lymphoid tissues exhibit reduced apoptotic activity in response to ionizing radiation compared to p53(+/+) tissues. Ionizing radiation treatment of p53(+/m) tissues also induces higher and prolonged levels of senescence markers p16(INK4a) and p21, suggesting that in p53(+/m) tissues the p53 stress response is enhanced and is shifted away from apoptosis toward senescence. One potential mechanism for accelerated aging in the p53(+/m) mouse is a failure to remove damaged or dysfunctional cells (including stem and progenitor cells) through apoptosis. The increased accumulation of dysfunctional and senescent cells may contribute to reduced tissue regeneration, tissue atrophy, and some of the accelerated aging phenotypes in p53(+/m) mice.",Excluded
908,"CT appearances of post-radiation livers in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. Objective: To characterize the computed tomographic (CT) findings of post-radiation livers and the interval changes in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirteen patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma who received concurrent chemoradiation with conformal radiotherapy technique (50 to 66 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction) were included in the present study. CT at pre-radiation and sequential follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were retrospectively reviewed by two abdominal radiologists to identify CT characteristics of post-radiation liver and the interval changes. Result(s): CT at pre-radiation and sequential follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were available in 92.3%, 100%, 76.9%, 53.8%, 30.8% and 23.1%, respectively. Post-radiation livers showed sharply-delineated, hypodense radiation areas, which were well related with the isodose line of 35 to 56 Gy (mean = 44.4 +/- 6.55 Gy). These radiation areas were mostly appreciated on portal venous phase at 1-month follow-up study in 12 of 13 (92.3%) patients and these were gradually less defined in subsequent studies. Progressive decrease size of radiation areas with persistent enhancement on delayed phase images were recognized. Progression of hepatic cortical irregularity was seen in four (30.8%) patients, as well as pulmonary fibrosis of lung bases. Conclusion(s): Post-radiation liver in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma showed a sharply-defined, hypodense radiation area, which was mostly appreciated in 1-month follow-up CT and was gradually less defined in subsequent studies with evidence of progressive atrophic change.",Excluded
1595,"Hormonal treatment after cytotoxic therapy stimulates recovery of spermatogenesis. Previous studies have shown that treatment of rats with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues or steroids either before exposure to procarbazine or radiation or after irradiation enhances subsequent levels of spermatogenesis. We demonstrate here that giving a GnRH agonist after procarbazine injection also enhances spermatogenesis and fertility. We also demonstrate that GnRH agonist stimulated recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility not only when the hormone was administered immediately after irradiation, but also at 20 weeks after irradiation, after the decline in spermatogenesis had occurred. These results suggest that GnRH agonist treatment given to azoospermic men after cytotoxic therapy for cancer may stimulate the recovery of spermatogenesis and fertility.",Excluded
130,"Lower urinary tract function after intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy for invasive bladder cancer. BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as a bladder-sparing regimen for invasive bladder cancer is highly promising for selected patients. However, lower urinary tract function after this treatment has not been fully investigated. METHOD(S): The urodynamic effects of intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy were retrospectively evaluated in 14 patients with organ-confined invasive bladder cancer. The post-treatment urodynamic findings were compared with the pretreatment ones (n = 7), and a comparison was made between the serial urodynamic findings after the treatment in another seven patients who were able to undergo the pretreatment urodynamic study (UDS). RESULT(S): The median follow-up period up to the latest UDS was 34 months. Of the 14 patients, the latest UDS revealed some storage dysfunctions in 11 (79%) and some emptying dysfunctions in three (23%). Uninhibited detrusor contraction and decreased bladder compliance were recorded in 29 and 43% at the pretreatment UDS and approximately 50-60 and 20-60% in the serial follow-up studies, respectively (n = 7). Impaired detrusor contractility lasted in one patient. In the seven patients without the pretreatment UDS, decreased maximum cystometric capacity and decreased compliance were recorded in approximately 50-60 and 20-60% at the serial UDS, respectively. Detrusor contractility was aggravated in one patient and completely lost in one with time. CONCLUSION(S): The urodynamic findings indicate that the bladder-sparing regimen might result in perpetuating the lower urinary tract dysfunctions due to invasive bladder cancer itself and/or transurethral surgery and might injure the infrasacral autonomic nerves and the bladder itself.",Excluded

478,"New onset diplopia in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma following concurrent chemoradiotherapy: Clinical features and etiology. Purpose. To investigate the clinical features and etiology of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients with new onset diplopia after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of NPC patients with new onset diplopia after concurrent chemoradiotherapy from 1998 to 2012 in a cancer center. Their clinical manifestations of ocular motor dysfunction in relation to etiology were investigated. Results. Twenty-three NPC patients with diplopia after concurrent chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in this study. Unilateral cranial VI palsy (91%) was the most common ocular motor dysfunction in these patients. The new onset diplopia in these patients was secondary to tumor recurrence in 12 cases (52%), radiation neuropathy in 8 cases (35%), and skull base osteoradionecrosis in 3 cases (13%). Patients with tumor recurrence and skull base osteoradionecrosis tended to present a rapid progression of the nerve palsy or severe ocular duction deficit. Patients with radiation neuropathy were often manifested by incomplete nerve palsy with insidious onset and slow progression. Patients with osteoradionecrosis were associated with poor prognosis. Conclusions. A new onset diplopia in NPC patients could be caused by tumor recurrence or treatment complications such as radiation neuropathy and osteoradionecrosis, and they show diverse clinical symptoms, course, and outcome.Copyright © 2015 Hui-Chuan Kau and Chieh-Chih Tsai.",Excluded

Background/Aim: Endoluminal self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) may overcome the risk of mortality and morbidity of acute intestinal obstruction because of stage IV colon (CC) or rectal (RC) cancer. We evaluated the QoL in these groups of patients. Patients and Methods: Forty-eight patients were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal cohort single-center trial to undergo SEMS positioning. Twenty-five patients had a CC and 23 RC. Karnofsky performance scale, Visual Analogue Scale and the EQ-5D- 5LTM questionnaire were administered before treatment and at 1, 3 and 6 months. Result(s): Harmonized to the Italian population, the index values showed a statistically significant deterioration of the QoL in patients with RC when compared to those with CC at 1-, 3- and 6-months (1 month: p=0.001; 3- month: p=0.001; 6-month: p=0.045). Similarly, Visual Analogue Scale showed variations at 1- (p=0.008), 3- (p=0.001) and 6-months (p=0.020). Rectal stent deployment was the only independent predictor for a worse QoL in all domains (p<0.017; OR=0.196; 95%CI=0.51- 0.749). Conclusion(s): Patients affected with stage IV CC had a better QoL after SEMS placement when compared to those affected with RC. The persistency of the primary tumor at the rectal level, even if irradiated, might negatively affect QoL.Copyright © 2021 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

403,"Measuring and assessing individual external doses during the rehabilitation phase in Iitate village after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident. After the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in 2011, Iitate village was placed under an evacuation order because the level of radioactive materials drifting from the nuclear plant to the village was above a government-set level for allowing residents to live in the area. The evacuation advisory for most of the village was lifted on 31 March 2017. For displaced residents deciding whether or not to return to their homes, it is important to correctly understand and estimate the realistic individual external doses they will receive after returning to the village. In this study, with the support of residents of the village, we used a personal dosimeter (D-Shuttle) coupled with a global positioning system device to measure and thus understand realistic individual external doses while the residents were in Iitate village and to project the individual external doses for different administrative districts as of 1 April 2017. The measured individual external doses measured by D-Shuttle for 38 study participants showed that the doses measured during time spent inside the village were higher and more widely distributed than the doses measured during time spent outside the village. The exposure ratio (ER) was defined as the ratio of additional individual external dose measured by D-Shuttle to the additional ambient dose based on an airborne monitoring survey. The medians of the average ERs were 0.13 (min-max 0.06-0.27) for time spent at home and 0.18 (min-max 0.08-0.36) for time spent outdoors. Projected additional annual individual external doses as of 1 April 2017 for different administrative districts in the village were calculated using ERs obtained in this study. Assuming that individuals spent 8 h per day on outdoor activities and 16 h on indoor activities, additional annual individual external doses were estimated to be below 3 mSv using the mean of the average ERs for most districts in the village, and these values were well below the individual external doses estimated using the approach taken by the central government. The results of this study provide valuable information both for understanding realistic radiological situations in the village and for those who want to know their future individual external dose in order to make a decision on whether or not to live in the village.",Excluded
2155,"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for stage I-II natural killer/T-cell lymphoma nasal type: Dosimetric and clinical results. Background: This study was to compare radiotherapy treatment planning and treatment outcomes following three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in stage I-II natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma. Method(s): The cases of 94 patients with stage I-II NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type in the upper aerodigestive tract who treated between May 2005 and Dec 2008 were reviewed. These patients received radiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy. Definitive radiotherapy was conducted using 3DCRT in 47 patients and IMRT in the other 47 patients with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy. Dosimetric pmeters of radiation treatment plans, local control probability (LCP), overall survival (OS), and toxicities were analyzed and compared between 3DCRT and IMRT. Result(s): From the dosimetric analysis, IMRT demonstrated significantly better dose coverage and homogeneity than 3DCRT. However, after a median follow-up of 46 months, IMRT was not associated with improvements in 4y-OS (80.9% for 3DCRT vs. 82.7% for IMRT, p=0.87) or 4y-LCP (86.3% for 3DCRT vs. 88.9% for IMR p=0.85). Of the 18 patients who received cervical lymph node irradiation, those in the IMRT group received a lower mean parotid dose. Furthermore, at-risk organs were strictly kept within the safe dose range in both groups, and no severe late toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): IMRT provided better dose coverage than 3DCRT, although it failed to provide LCP and OS benefits. Definitive radiotherapy with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy is efficient and safe for NK/T-cell lymphoma using either IMRT or 3DCRT. However, IMRT may have the potential to reduce parotid gland hypofunction following cervical irradiation. © 2013 Shen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1458,"MR-Angiography in assessing the anatomy of the renal arteries before renal sympathetic denervation. The paper presents comparative analysis of preoperation MR-angiography and X-ray angiography carried out before renal denervation of sympathetic plexus of renal arteries in patients with resistant arterial hypertension. Purpose. To compare the data of MRA and diagnostic X-ray angiography of the renal arteries to determine a method that allows you to plan in detail the renal denervation procedure. Materials and methods. 44 patients (16 men, 28 women; average age was 59.18 years) with a verified diagnosis: resistant hypertension, admitted to treatment (renal denervation). All patients underwent standard preoperative laboratory and instrumental diagnostics. Survey aortography with selective renal angiography and MR angiography were performed in all 44 (100%) patients. Results and conclusion. It has been shown that both methods are comparable in the detection of renal arteries stenosis, as well as in visualization of the main renal artery and of segment branches of arteries, and in measurement of their diameters. In most cases MR-angiography a little bit exaggerates the diameter of the artery for as low as 0.6-0.8 mm. Also MR-angiography do not deliver radiation exposure to a patient. Moreover, MRA provides the opportunity of sequential thin-slice imaging, and may separate branches of the renal arteries up to segment branches of 3-4 classes with high accuracy. In total, the MRA predicts the anatomic imaging with invasive catheter X-ray angiography and allows to plan it in details before renal sympathetic denervation.Copyright © 2019 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

Patients received 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 min bottom time, once a day, 7 days a week for at least 1 month. In principle, 30 HBO treatments per course were performed. After every course of HBO treatments, therapeutic effect was evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up of all patients was 18 months (range: 1-6 years)., RESULTS: Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (treatment group, n = 10) and group 2 (without treatment, n = 4). The mean duration between the onset of hematuria and the beginning of HBO therapy was 8.9 months (range: 3-34). Group 2 did not receive HBO because they were not healthy enough. Only 2 patients (20%) of group 1 recovered from their hemorrhagic cystitis. Group 1 had a significantly lower cure rate of postirradiation hemorrhagic cystitis in comparison to group 2., CONCLUSIONS: Our experience with the use of HBO did not yield favorable results.

1644,"Outcomes of surgical management of peptic ulcer perforation using the falciform ligament: A cross-sectional study at a single centre in Vietnam. Introduction: Peptic ulcer perforation (PUP) is one of the most common critical surgical emergencies. The omentum flap is commonly used to cover a PUP. However, the omentum cannot be used in cases of severe peritonitis or previous surgical removal. This is the first study conducted in Vietnam that was designed to analyse the outcomes of patients with PUPs who were treated using the falciform ligament. Method(s): In this study, we retrospectively identified 40 consecutive patients who were treated for PUP at a single high-volume centre in Vietnam from February 2018 to February 2021. Peptic ulcer perforation was measured during diagnostic evaluation based on preoperative imaging, such as X-ray, and CT scan. Patients who had malignancy, laparoscopic surgery, omentopexy and nonoperative treatment were excluded from this research. Result(s): Forty patients were included; the mean age of the patients was 66.3 years (range 33-99 years), and some patients had comorbid disease (57.5%), hypertension (30%), diabetes (10%), cirrhosis (7.5%), and chronic renal failure (7.5%). The PUPs were located in the duodenum (80%), or the pyloric (15%) and prepyloric (5%) regions. The procedures used to treat the patients included duodenostomy (32.5%), gastrojejunostomy (37.5%), and antrum resection (2.5%). The average operative time was 88.6 min (45-180 min), hospital stay was 9.6 days (2-35 days), and oral intake was started at 4.1 days (3-8 days); additionally, the 30-day mortality (17.5%) and incidences of pneumonia (25%), multiorgan failure (15%), acute liver failure (5%), wound infection (7.5%), and ulcer peptic fistula (0%) were assessed. Univariate tests showed that an ASA >= III and comorbidities, such as pulmonary complications, liver failure and multiorgan failure, were associated with mortality. The multivariate test showed that multiorgan failure was the only factor related to mortality. Conclusion(s): The falciform ligament can be efficiently used for the closure of a PUP. Although there were no instances of complication with a reperforated peptic ulcer, the mortality rate was slightly highly related to severe comorbidities and postoperative multiorgan failure.Copyright © 2021",Excluded

This review presents lower body negative pressure (LBNP) as a unique tool to investigate the physiology of integrated systemic compensatory responses to altered hemodynamic patterns during conditions of central hypovolemia in humans. An early review published in Physiological Reviews over 40 yr ago (Wolthuis et al. Physiol Rev 54: 566-595, 1974) focused on the use of LBNP as a tool to study effects of central hypovolemia, while more than a decade ago a review appeared that focused on LBNP as a model of hemorrhagic shock (Cooke et al. J Appl Physiol (1985) 96: 1249-1261, 2004). Since then there has been a great deal of new research that has applied LBNP to investigate complex physiological responses to a variety of challenges including orthostasis, hemorrhage, and other important stressors seen in humans such as microgravity encountered during spaceflight. The LBNP stimulus has provided novel insights into the physiology underlying areas such as intolerance to reduced central blood volume, sex differences concerning blood pressure regulation, autonomic dysfunctions, adaptations to exercise training, and effects of space flight. Furthermore, approaching cardiovascular assessment using prediction models for orthostatic capacity in healthy populations, derived from LBNP tolerance protocols, has provided important insights into the mechanisms of orthostatic hypotension and central hypovolemia, especially in some patient populations as well as in healthy subjects. This review also presents a concise discussion of mathematical modeling regarding compensatory responses induced by LBNP. Given the diverse applications of LBNP, it is to be expected that new and innovative applications of LBNP will be developed to explore the complex physiological mechanisms that underline health and disease.Copyright © 2019 the American Physiological Society.",Excluded
2261,"New and evolving concepts in CT for abdominal vascular imaging. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography has become the standard of care, supplanting invasive angiography for comprehensive initial evaluation of acute and chronic conditions affecting the vascular system in the abdomen and elsewhere. Over the past decade, the capabilities of CT have improved substantially; simultaneously, the expectations of the referring physician and vascular surgeons have also evolved. Increasingly, CT angiography is used as an imaging biomarker for treatment selection and assessment of effectiveness. However, the growing use of CT angiography has also introduced some challenges, as potential radiation-associated and contrast media-induced risks need to be addressed. These concerns can be partly confronted by modifying scanning parameters (applying a low tube voltage) with or without using software-based solutions. Most recently, multienergy technology has endowed CT with new capabilities offering improved CT angiographic image quality and novel plaque characterization while decreasing radiation and iodine dose. In this article, we discuss current and new approaches using both conventional and multienergy CT for studying vascular disease in the abdomen. We propose various approaches to overcoming commonly encountered image quality challenges in CT angiography.

AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the effect of omitting predilation on feasibility, procedural results and safety in balloon-expandable TAVI., METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an analysis of all 680 patients scheduled for a balloon-expandable TAVI prosthesis between January 2011 and August 2016. Patients treated with or without predilation were compared. Procedure times decreased from 85.6+/-42.9 to 56.7+/-26.1 minutes (p<0.001), fluoroscopy times from 9.5+/-5.7 to 6.2+/-3.9 minutes (p<0.001) and contrast volume from 131.9+/-60.8 to 85.4+/-37.4 ml (p<0.001) without predilation. Intraprocedural CPR was significantly more frequent in the predilation group (5.3% vs. 1.4%, p=0.01). Stroke rate was low at 1.5% and with no detectable difference. Applying VARC-2 definitions, the combined endpoints device success (88.3% vs. 92.4%, p=0.07) and clinical efficacy (88.7% vs. 92.4%, p=0.11) were comparable with or without prior valvuloplasty, while early safety was less frequent with predilation (85.2% vs. 90.2%, p=0.04).

2951,"A predictive model for residual disease after (chemo) radiotherapy in oropharyngeal carcinoma: Combined radiological and clinical evaluation of tumor response. Background and purpose Early detection of Residual disease (RD) is vital for salvage possibilities after (chemo) radiatiotherapy for oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC). We standardized clinical investigation to test its added value to MRI response evaluation and investigated the benefit of FDG-PET/CT. Materials and methods Radiological response evaluation using Ojiri-score was done for 234 patients with OPC, using MRI 12 weeks after (chemo) radiotherapy between 2010 and 2014. The presence of mucosal lesions and/or major complaints (still completely tube feeding-dependent and/or opiate-dependent because of swallowing problems) was scored as clinical suspicion (CS). Retrospectively, the performance of Ojiri to predict RD was compared to CS and both combined using Pearson Chi-squared. Of the whole group, FDG-PET/CT metabolic response (MR) was available in 50 patients. Results Twelve out of 234 patients (5.1%) had RD. Ojiri and CS had excellent negative predictive value (NPV) (98% and 100% respectively). The combination of CS and Ojiri reduced false positives by 32% (38-26 patients) without lowering NPV (98%). No patients with complete MR (n = 39) at the FDG-PET/CT had RD compared to 5 (45%) with partial MR. Conclusion For response evaluation in OPC, the combination of CS and Ojiri-score improved the predictive accuracy by reducing false positives compared to them individually. FDG-PET/CT is promising to further reduce false positives.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded
3454,"A novel ultrafast-low-dose computed tomography protocol allows concomitant coronary artery evaluation and lung cancer screening. Background: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is often performed in patients who are at high risk for lung cancer in whom screening is currently recommended. We tested diagnostic ability and radiation exposure of a novel ultra-low-dose CT protocol that allows concomitant coronary artery evaluation and lung screening. Method(s): We studied 30 current or former heavy smoker subjects with suspected or known coronary artery disease who underwent CT assessment of both coronary arteries and thoracic area (Revolution CT, General Electric). A new ultrafast-low-dose single protocol was used for ECG-gated helical acquisition of the heart and the whole chest. A single IV iodine bolus (70-90 ml) was used. All patients with CT evidence of coronary stenosis underwent also invasive coronary angiography. Result(s): All the coronary segments were assessable in 28/30 (93%) patients. Only 8 coronary segments were not assessable in 2 patients due to motion artefacts (assessability: 98%; 477/485 segments). In the assessable segments, 20/21 significant stenoses (> 70% reduction of vessel diameter) were correctly diagnosed. Pulmonary nodules were detected in 5 patients, thus requiring to schedule follow-up surveillance CT thorax. Effective dose was 1.3 +/- 0.9 mSv (range: 0.8-3.2 mSv). Noteworthy, no contrast or radiation dose increment was required with the new protocol as compared to conventional coronary CT protocol. Conclusion(s): The novel ultrafast-low-dose CT protocol allows lung cancer screening at time of coronary artery evaluation. The new approach might enhance the cost-effectiveness of coronary CT in heavy smokers with suspected or known coronary artery disease.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in particular gallium-68 (68Ga) applications are growing exponentially worldwide contributing to the expansion of nuclear medicine and personalized management of patients. The significance of 68Ga utility is reflected in the implementation of European Pharmacopoeia monographs. However, there is one crucial point in the monographs that might limit the use of the generators and consequently expansion of 68Ga applications and that is the limit of 0.001% of Germanium-68 (68Ge(IV)) radioactivity content in a radiophar-maceutical. We have investigated the organ distribution of 68Ge(IV) in rat and estimated human dosimetry parameters in order to provide experimental evidence for the determination and justification of the 68Ge(IV) limit. Male and female rats were injected in the tail vein with formulated [68Ge]GeCl4 in the absence or presence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. The tissue radioactivity distribution data was extrapolated for the estimation of human organ equivalent doses and total effective dose using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM). 68Ge(IV) was evenly distributed among the rat organs and fast renal excretion prevailed. Human organ equivalent dose and total effective dose estimates indicated that the kidneys were the dose-limiting organs (185+/-54 muSv/MBq for female and 171+/-38 muSv/MBq for male) and the total effective dose was 15.5+/-0.1 and 10.7+/-1.2 muSv/MBq, respectively for female and male. The results of this dosimetry study conclude that the 68Ge(IV) limit currently recommended by monographs could be increased considerably (>100 times) without exposing the patient to harm given the small absorbed doses to normal organs and fast excretion.",Excluded
1947,"T cell expansion study using the lesional skin provides evidence for the role of drug-specific Tc1 and Th17 cells in severe drug eruptions. Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) are life threatening adverse drug reactions. It is considered that antigen-specific T cells are involved in the pathogenesis. However, the role of drug-specific T cells in the skin lesions is not fully investigated. We expanded skin-infiltrating T cells from 4-mm biopsied lesional skin samples of TEN, SJS, DIHS, and erythema multiforme (EM) using anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and IL-2. We obtained >107 cells/specimen by this method. For the drug reactivity, T cells labeled with CFSE were cultured with X-ray-irradiated PBMCs from the same patients and causative drugs, and the proliferation was assessed by flow cytometry. The cytokine profiles of responding T cells were also examined by intracellular staining for interferon (IFN)-gamma;, IL-4, and IL-17, or by cytokine quantification of the supernatants. Both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells proliferated to the causative drugs in all cases. Notably, 80% of expanded CD8+ T cells with the causative drugs expressed high levels of IFN-gamma. The expanded CD4+ T cells bore IFN-gamma, IL-4 or IL-17A at various frequencies. The culture supernatants contained IL-17A at various concentrations. The ability of T cells to produce IL-17A did not correlate with their ability to produce the other cytokines. In DIHS, however, the IL-17A production levels appeared to fluctuate in parallel with the clinical courses. Our results demonstrate that drug-specific T cells are definitely present in the skin infiltrate of severe drug eruptions. It is suggested that drug-reactive, IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells infiltrate at a high frequency and Th17 cells also participate in the formation of lesional skin depending on cases.",Excluded
2233,"Health profiles of 996 melanoma survivors: The M. D. Anderson experience. Background: The incidence and survival of melanoma are increasing, but little is known about its long-term health effects in adult survivors. Method(s): A health survey was available from 996 melanoma survivors (577 treated with surgery alone, and 391 with combined treatments). Their medical/physiologic and psychosocial responses were analyzed and compared with those of the survivors from other cancers. Result(s): The melanoma survivors were 44.8 +/- 12.8 years of age at diagnosis (significantly younger than the survivors of other cancers) and 63.7 +/- 12.8 years at survey. Melanoma survivors were less likely to report that cancer had affected their health than survivors of other cancers (15.8% vs. 34.9%). The 577 individuals treated with surgery alone reported arthritis/osteoporosis, cataracts, and heart problems most frequently (less often than survivors of other cancers). The 391 individuals who had undergone combined treatments reported circulation problems and kidney problems generally as often as survivors of other cancers. Health problems were not associated with number of decades since diagnosis but with age at diagnosis, treatment modality, and family relationships. Conclusion(s): We present information from a large cohort of long-term survivors of melanoma. As a group, they were less likely to report that cancer had affected their overall health than survivors of other cancers; a number of disease related and psychosocial factors appear to influence their health profiles. © 2006 Stava et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
481,"[Acquisition of age- and sex-dependent patient data for the calculation of annual radiation exposure in nuclear medicine: a German pilot study]. AIM: A pilot study for estimation of radiation exposure due to diagnostic procedures in nuclear medicine using routine data of hospitals and practices in Germany., METHODS: Hospitals and practices willing to participate in the study supplied data of one year (1997), containing information on patients' identification number, age, sex, type of diagnostic procedure, radiopharmaceutical, administered activity, type of health insurance (private/public), inpatient/outpatient status, and so-called Leistungsziffer, which describes the type of medical performances in Germany. The effective dose per examination was calculated according to ICRP 80. Mean, standard deviation, median, 5th and 95th percentiles of the effective dose were calculated, stratified by type of organ system and also by sex and age, including patients of > or = 18 years., RESULTS: 82,039 examinations from patients of 9 hospitals and practices were analyzed. The median (5-95(th) percentiles) of the effective dose per examination for all patients was 2.9 mSv (0.4-8.5 mSv); 1.2 examinations per patient and year were performed on average. The three most frequent examinations were bone scans (median 3.4 mSv; 2.9-5.1), thyroid (0.9 mSv; 0.4-2.2) and cardiovascular studies (7.3 mSv; 3.8-20.2). The median effective dose for 18 to 40 years old women was 1.0 mSv (0.4-5.8), for women between 41 and 65 years 2.2 mSv (0.4-7.3) and for women older than 65 years 2.4 mSv (0.5-7.6). The corresponding values for men were 2.6 mSv (0.3-7.6); 3.3 mSv (0.4-9.1), and 3.4 mSv (0.5-8.8)., CONCLUSION: It was possible to gain an accurate determination of radiation exposure of diagnostic procedures in nuclear medicine by routine data.",Excluded
74,"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or robotic radiosurgery (RRS) for salvage treatment of colorectal liver metastases. Background. Stereotactic radiation therapy is an evolving modality to treat otherwise unresectable liver metastases. In this analysis, two local therapies: 1) single session robotic radiosurgery (RRS) and 2) percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were compared in a total of 60 heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patients. Methods. Thirty patients with a total of 35 colorectal liver metastases not qualifying for surgery that were treated in curative intent with RRS were prospectively followed. To compare efficacy of both treatment modalities, patients treated with RFA during the same period of time were matched according to number and size of the treated lesions. Local tumor control, local disease free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant recurrence (FFDR) were analyzed for efficacy. Treatment-related side effects were recorded for comparison. Results. The median diameter of the treated lesions was 33 mm (7-53 mm). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. One- and two-year local control rates showed no significant difference but favored RRS (85% vs. 65% and 80% vs. 61%, respectively). A significantly longer local DFS of patients treated with RRS compared to RFA (34.4 months vs. 6.0 months; p < 0.001) was found. Both, median FFDR (11.4 months for RRS vs. 7.1 months for RFA p = 0.25) and the recurrence rate (67% for RRS and 63% for RFA, p > 0.99) were comparable. Conclusion. Single session RRS is a safe and effective method to treat colorectal liver metastases. In this analysis, a trend towards longer DFS was seen in patients treated with RRS when compared to RFA.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
511,"Randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week post-operative radiotherapy vs concurrent post-operative radiochemotherapy in locally advanced cancer of the oral cavity/oropharynx: a report on acute normal tissue reactions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate acute normal tissue reactions and treatment compliance in a randomized clinical trial on 7-days-a-week post-operative radiotherapy (p-CAIR) vs post-operative concurrent radiochemotherapy (p-RTCT) in locally advanced cancer of the oral cavity/oropharynx. The sample analyzed at present represents approximately 30% of the intended future trial size., METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to receive 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 7 days a week (n = 44) or 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 5 days a week with concurrent cisplatin 80-100 mg per square metre of body surface area on Days 1, 22 and 43 of the course of radiotherapy (n = 40). Acute mucosal reactions were scored using the modified Dische system., RESULTS: 15 (17.9%) patients, including 5 patients in p-CAIR and 10 patients in p-RTCT, did not comply with the assigned radiation treatment, mostly because of rapid tumour progression or deteriorating general performance. In p-RTCT, 22 (55%) patients received less than the intended three courses of chemotherapy mostly owing to haematological toxicity. The average maximum mucosal severity score was 14.2 in p-CAIR compared with 13.4 in p-RTCT; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The schedules compared (p-CAIR and p-RTCT) did not differ considerably with respect to acute mucosal reactions. Haematological toxicity in p-RTCT was elevated compared with p-CAIR. Both schedules were considered tolerable with respect to acute toxicity, which justifies further recruitment to the trial., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The results show that early mucosal reactions are comparable in both trial arms but haematological toxicity is more pronounced during radiochemotherapy.",Excluded

Level 1 evidence, largely predicated on the German Rectal Cancer Study, supports neoadjuvant treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent this evidence has affected clinical practice. Stage II/III rectal cancer patients undergoing surgery from 1998 to 2007 were identified in the SEER tumor registry. Variables were analyzed with SPSS software. Trends were evaluated with regression models. Survivals were compared with the log-rank test. A total of 22,136 patients were identified and 15,021 (67.8%) were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy. A large percentage were >60 years old (64.4%), white (83.0%), male (58.8%), at stage III (55.1%), and treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy (35.5%). A significant increase in the use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy occurred: from 17% in 1998 to 51% in 2007 (p < 0.001). Scatter-plot best-fit lines for neoadjuvant and adjuvant radiotherapy intersected at approximately year 2002. Significant increases in preoperative radiotherapy were observed for all races and cancer stages (p < 0.001). On unadjusted analysis, race (p = 0.018), sex (p < 0.001), year of diagnosis (p < 0.001), age (p < 0.001), and stage (p < 0.001) were associated with increased likelihood of neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

2942,"Salivary and serum proteomics in head and neck carcinomas: Before and after surgery and radiotherapy. Several body fluids have been evaluated as new sources for cancer biomarker discovery. In this context, salivary and serum proteomics seem promising diagnostic and predictive tools for head and neck diseases. In the present study, we performed a proteomic analysis of saliva and serum from patients presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and compared the results before and after therapy. In saliva of cancer patients, we observed an altered protein profile, including over-expression of PLUNC and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein. Both proteins may contribute to control tumor growth and, therefore, represent targets for new analysis. We also detected serotransferrin and a modified transthyretin form with altered levels in serum from patients. Comparing preoperative and postreatment samples, the results showed that the protein profile after treatment reverted to a pattern closer to those observed for controls. These results add information on the role of secreted proteins in the cancer process and emphasize the potential of saliva and serum analysis for diagnosis and monitoring of HNSCC. © 2010/2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

521,"Alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy for inoperable stage III non- small-cell lung cancer: Long-term results of two phase II GOTHA trials. Purpose/Objective: To report on two consecutive Phase II cooperative trials in which we evaluated the combination of alternating hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in inoperable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded

2228,"Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry in healthy volunteers of a novel tumour-specific probe for PET/CT imaging: BAY 85-8050. Purpose: Novel tracers for the diagnosis of malignant disease with PET and PET/CT are being developed as the most commonly used 18F deoxyglucose (FDG) tracer shows certain limitations. Employing radioactively labelled glutamate derivatives for specific imaging of the truncated citrate cycle potentially allows more specific tumour imaging. Radiation dosimetry of the novel tracer BAY 85-8050, a glutamate derivative, was calculated and the effective dose (ED) was compared with that of FDG. Method(s): Five healthy volunteers were included in the study. Attenuation-corrected whole-body PET/CT scans were performed from 0 to 90 min, at 120 and at 240 min after injection of 305.0 +/- 17.6 MBq of BAY 85-8050. Organs with moderate to high uptake at any of the imaging time points were used as source organs. Total activity in each organ at each time point was measured. Time-activity curves (TAC) were determined for the whole body and all source organs. The resulting TACs were fitted to exponential equations and accumulated activities were determined. OLINDA/EXM software was used to calculate individual organ doses and the whole-body ED from the acquired data. Result(s): Uptake of the tracer was highest in the kidneys due to renal excretion of the tracer, followed by the pancreas, heart wall and osteogenic cells. The mean organ doses were: kidneys 38.4 +/- 11.2 muSv/MBq, pancreas 23.2 +/- 3.8 muSv/MBq, heart wall 17.4 +/- 4.1 muSv/MBq, and osteogenic cells 13.6 +/- 3.5 muSv/MBq. The calculated ED was 8.9 +/- 1.5 muSv/MBq. Conclusion(s): Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the calculated radiation dose of BAY 85-8050 is 2.67 +/- 0.45 mSv at a patient dose of 300 MBq, which compares favourably with the radiation dose of FDG (5.7 mSv). © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Irradiated males were mated to females that had received treatment with caffeine or honey (by feeding), and the frequencies of sex chromosome losses and chromosome rearrangements induced in mature spermatozoa of the males were compared. Caffeine treatment led to an enhancement of the frequencies of sex chromosome loss and a decrease in those of rearrangements. These findings can be interpreted on the assumption that caffeine inhibits repair and misrepair processes that are active in the oocytes. Caffeine treatment administered to one of the female stocks used in these studies was without any effect, presumably because of the absence of a caffeine sensitive repair mechanism in the oocytes.",Excluded

Background: This study aimed to elucidate the influence of skin invasion in patients with recurrent head and neck cancer treated with re-irradiation using stereotactic radiotherapy. Materials: We reviewed 104 patients treated using CyberKnife in four institutions. Result(s): Nine cases of skin invasion were recognized (8.6 %). Larger tumors tended to exhibit skin invasion. The skin invasion (+) group showed a lower response rate (0/9, 0 %) than the skin invasion (-) group (56/95, 59 %) (p = 0.002). The skin invasion (+) group showed lower local control (LC) and progression free survival (PFS) rates, both 0 % at 6 months, than the skin invasion (-) group, which had a LC of 69 % (p = 0.0001) and a PFS of 48 % at 1 year (p = 0.0157).

Method(s): Between July 1999 and December 2004, a total of 122 Intracranial lesions In 78 patients with BM were treated using SRT in our Center. Forty-nine patients had a solitary lesion and 29 had multiple (2-6) lesions. The median SRT dose was 15 Gy (11-24 Gy) in single fraction for 38 lesions, and 24 Gy (11-40 Gy) in 2-6 fractions for 84 lesions. SRT was combined with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30-40 Gy for 39 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by the log-rank test and Cox model, respectively. Result(s): The median survival time was 12.9 months (1.7-77.4 months). The 1-year intracranial PFS rate was 87.4%. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 53.9% and 25.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the 1-year OS rates were higher In the patients with pretreatment KPS of s= 70, extracranial lesions controlled, or SRT combined with WBRT than in those with KPS of < 70 (60.7% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.002), extracranial lesions uncontrolled (69% vs. 44.9%, P = 0.005), or SRT alone (64.1% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.03). The benefit of treating with WBRT in combination was mainly achieved in the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or with more than one Intracranial lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that KPS score and status of extracranial lesions were independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): SRT is an effective and safe modality for BM. SRT combined with WBRT may prolong the survival time of the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or multiple Intracranial lesions. Independent prognostic factors for OS are KPS score and status of extracranial lesions.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: The radiated tortoise (Geochelone radiata) is a critically endangered species in its native land, the southern portion of the island of Madagascar. Captive breeding programs have generated data on the breeding behavior and ecology of G radiata; however, hematologic and biochemical data also are critically important in managing populations. OBJECTIVE(S): The purpose of this study was to evaluate sex and seasonal effects on hematologic and biochemical data from captive radiated tortoises. METHOD(S): Whole blood was collected in January and August 2001 from 18 radiated tortoises (10 male, 8 female) housed at the Wildlife Survival Center on St Catherines Island, Georgia, as part of a routine health assessment. Routine hematologic and plasma biochemical analyses and electrophoresis were done using standard methods. Data from male and female tortoises were compared within and between seasons using 2-way ANOVA. RESULT(S): RBC and HCT values were significantly higher in summer than in winter and were higher in males than in females. Total protein concentration did not differ significantly between males and females; however, female tortoises had significantly higher concentrations of alpha1- and beta-globulins in winter and summer compared to males. Male tortoises had significantly higher sodium and uric acid concentrations and LDH activity during winter, and higher urea concentration and LDH and CK activities in summer, compared with females. Female tortoises had significantly higher triglyceride and phosphorus concentrations in winter, and higher phosphorus, cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations in summer, compared with males.

1330,"Management of extended radionecrosis in the pelvic area with repeated surgical debridement and omental transposition. Extended radionecrosis in the pelvic area is a disaster occurring in a minority of patients treated with radiotherapy. Extensive excisional procedures, including pelvic exenteration, have been recommended, but carry high morbidity and mortality rates. Alternative treatment strategies are needed to improve survival and increase the quality of life in these patients. We retrospectively analysed the charts of eight patients treated for radionecrosis in the pelvic area between 1985 and 1991. During this period deviatory procedures, repeated but limited debridement and the early incorporation of an omental flap in the ischemic area were used in an attempt to avoid exenteration, but effectively stop further progression of infection and necrosis. The patients underwent a median of five surgical interventions (range: 2 to 21) for 10 sites of radionecrosis. The total of 61 procedures consisted of debridement (29), omental pedicle grafting (6), deviation of urinary tract (3) or intestinal tract (4) and including procedures due to complications (21). They were hospitalized for a median duration of 95 days (range 43-155) divided over several admissions (median 3, range 2-8). One patient died of sepsis during treatment. Complete recovery was achieved in all surviving patients with a median of 12 months (range: 9 to 20 months) after initial surgery. Early surgery, the limited extent of the procedures and omental transposition were the main components of our approach. We conclude that this approach has an acceptable morbidity and mortality rate, while a relatively good quality of life is achieved.",Excluded

1349,"The tolerance of proton radiotherapy - Preliminary results. Introduction. Because the specific proton beam dose distribution (i.e. the so-called 'Bragg curve'), proton radiotherapy ensures that the high-dose region is precisely confined to the target volume while minimizing the dose delivered to healthy tissues/critical organs surrounding the tumour or to those lying in the path of the proton beam. This method has been used for patients in Krakow since November 2016. Aim. To report the early tolerance outcomes to proton radiotherapy in patients completing their treatment just before the end of August 2017. Materials and methods. Study subjects were 47 patients who had completed their treatment before the end of August 2017 with a mean age of 41.6 years (range: 16-76, median: 40). The most frequent diagnoses were skull base tumours (22 pts. - 46.8%) and brain G1 or G2 gliomas (17 pts. - 36.2%), whereas the most frequent histological types were chordomas (17 pts. - 36.2%). Proton radiotherapy was administered by pencil beam scanning and consisted of using the intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) technique. The total dose given per cancer type averaged as follows: (i) 70 and 74 Gy(RBE), for respectively chodrosarcomas and chordomas, (ii) 54 Gy(RBE) for brain gliomas and (iii) 70 Gy(RBE) for paranasal sinuses tumours. Early tolerance was prospectively evaluated and measured according to the CTCAE scale, version 4.03. Results. In all, 91 side effects (SE) were recorded in 44 patients. The intensity of SEs were as following: 62 SEs (68.1%) were of grade 1 intensity, 21 SEs (23.1%) were of grade 2 and 8 SEs (8.8%) were of grade 3. The most frequently developed SEs were skin reactions (29 pts. - 61.7%) or oral/pharyngeal mucositis (20 pts. - 42.6%).

Result(s): 37 patients (= 24%) had noticed pain in the LC before the day of surgery. 76. 3% (n = 119, group A) of the patients had no cartilage damage of the LC, 10.3% (n = 16) had a single lesion of the lateral tibial plateau or femoral condyle (group B), 13.4% (n = 21) had corresponding lesions of the LC (group C). Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups concerning mean follow-up, BMI, the Lysholm score or VAS score (p > 0.05). Differences could be found concerning patient age (group A, B > group C; p > 0.001) and preoperative varus deformity (group A < group B,C; p < 0.003). In all patients, HTO was planed aiming for a comparable mild postoperative valgus alignment (p = 0.53). With regard to clinical outcome parameters, group A had the best results reaching statistical significance in the final WOMACpain score (p = 0.032) and WOMACfunction score (p = 0.049). ICRS score of the LC cartilage lesions correlated significantly with WOMACpain and the WOMACfunction. Nonetheless, all of the groups A to C showed a significant increase in the Lysholm score (p< 0.001) and decrease in pain level (VAS score) at final follow up (p < 0.001). Preoperative patient selection prior to the performance of a valgus high tibial osteotomy is of major importance. Presence of cartilage damage of the lateral compartment is adversely influencing final clinical outcome and has to be seen as a relative contraindication for valgus high tibial osteotomy. Nonetheless, even in those patients a significant improvement of functional parameters and decrease of pain levels can be observed.",Excluded
396,"Utility of postoperative radiographs after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior instrumentation. STUDY DESIGN.: Retrospective clinical and radiographical review. OBJECTIVE.: To evaluate the utility of plain radiographical surveillance after anterior lumbar interbody fusion and determine to what extent radiographical findings affect postoperative decision making. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographical surveillance is a ubiquitous practice among spine surgeons, which lacks evidence and has received growing attention in an environment of increasing health care cost and receding resources. Lumbar interbody fusions are being performed with increasing frequency from numerous approaches; nonetheless, there are no evidence-based guidelines for postoperative radiographical evaluation of patients after these procedures. METHODS.: One hundred forty-six consecutive patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without short segment posterior fusion from 2008 to 2011 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were less than 6 months of follow-up, prior surgery, hybrid constructs with disc arthroplasty, and concurrent posterior fusion of greater than 3 levels. Three hundred fifty-nine radiographical series and 330 clinic notes of the included 67 patients were reviewed. Radiographs were evaluated for abnormalities and clinic notes reviewed for any changes in clinical management by multiple reviewers. Interobserver reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS.: There was no single instance of a change in treatment course based on radiographical findings alone in any of the 330 clinic visits of the 67 included patients during an average 15.8-month postoperative follow-up period. Thirty-four of the 67 patients (51%) had some change in their management on the basis of their clinical symptoms and/or examination. Interobserver agreement for change in management was 0.96 (kappa = 0.918). Sensitivity (6%), specificity (97%), positive predictive value (67%), and negative predictive value (50%) were calculated. CONCLUSION.: Routine postoperative radiographical surveillance has minimal value for asymptomatic patients after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior fusion. Obtaining a limited number of postoperative films of these patients in the absence of clinical symptoms or risk factors could significantly reduce health care costs and unnecessary radiation exposure. © 2013, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
650,"Higher levels of metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein levels are associated with less favourable treatment response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs in female patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis. Background Metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein was identified as a pro-inflammatory and pro-destructive factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our research group has previously demonstrated that S100A4 is significantly elevated in peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue of RA patients and that the levels of S100A4 correlate with disease activity. Objectives To evaluate the levels of S100A4 in serum of patients with recent-onset RA and to characterize the association of S100A4 with disease activity and response to treatment. Methods Serum levels of S100A4 protein were measured by ELISA in 59 patients with recent-onset RA (symptom duration <6 months) before and 3 months after initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and cross-sectionally in 42 healthy controls. IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed at baseline. Clinical disease activity (DAS28) was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. The degree of radiographic joint damage was calculated from x-rays using the Sharp-van der Heijde Score (SHS) at baseline and at month 12. Results Mean DAS28 (SD) significantly decreased from 5.36 (1.42) at baseline to 3.09 (1.52) at month 3 (n=59) and to 2.69 (1.19) at month 12 (n=40), respectively (p<0.0001). Of the 40 patients with available radiographs, 9 (23%) showed an increase in SHS (SHS >0) after 12 months. The levels of serum S100A4 protein were significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy controls (646.60+/-602.60 vs. 46.97+/-30.12 ng/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (to 388.10+/-521.00; p<0.001). There was positive correlation of baseline levels of S100A4 with IgM-RF (r=0.611; p<0.0001) and ACPA levels (r=0.471; p<0.001). After adjustment for IgM-RF, the levels of S100A4 at baseline (r=0.403; p<0.05) as well as at month 3 (r=0.548; p<0.01) were positively correlated with DAS28 after 12 months of treatment in female patients (n=28). There was no correlation in male patients. The levels of S100A4 did not correlate with disease activity at baseline or with the change of disease activity over time. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline levels or changes of SA100A4 and achievement of DAS28 remission or radiographic progression. Conclusions Our results indicate that circulating S100A4 levels are significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy individuals and that higher S100A4 levels at baseline or at month 3 might have predictive potential for worse treatment response at month 12, at least in female patients with recent-onset RA.",Excluded
2206,"Comparing outcomes of concurrent chemotherapy regimens in patients 65 years old or older with locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. Background: The comparative efficacy of cisplatin (CDDP), carboplatin, and cetuximab (CTX) delivered concurrently with radiation for locally advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma continues to be evaluated. Method(s): The linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database was used to identify and compare patient and disease profiles, mortality, toxicity, and overall cost for patients with oropharynx cancer undergoing definitive concurrent chemoradiation with CDDP, carboplatin, or CTX between 2006 and 2011. The human papillomavirus status was unknown. The primary outcome was 2-year overall survival (OS). Result(s): Four hundred nine patients receiving concurrent CDDP (n = 167), carboplatin (n = 69), or CTX (n = 173) were included. Those who were older, those who were nonwhite, and those with a Charlson Comorbidity Index >= 2 were less likely to receive CDDP. Two-year OS was inferior with CTX (hazard ratio [HR], 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.60; P =.020) and no different with carboplatin (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.73-2.35; P =.362) in a Cox proportional hazards model (reference CDDP). There was no statistically significant difference between carboplatin and CTX (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.77-2.14; P =.891). Rates of antiemetic use and hospital visits for nausea/emesis/diarrhea or dehydration were statistically higher with CDDP. Pneumonia rates were higher with carboplatin. In the multivariate model, the corrected mean per-patient spending was significantly higher for CTX and carboplatin than CDDP ($61,133 and $65,721 vs $48,709). Conclusion(s): Patients who received CDDP had improved OS. CDDP was also associated with slightly lower overall costs and higher antiemetic usage and hospital visit rates, although a strong selection bias was observed because those receiving CTX and carboplatin were older and had higher comorbidity scores.Copyright © 2018 American Cancer Society",Excluded

PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of visualizing preprocedural MR images in 3-dimensional (3D) space using augmented reality (AR) before transarterial embolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a preclinical model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 28 rats with diethylnitrosamine-induced HCCs > 5 mm treated with embolization were included in a prospective study. In 12 rats, 3D AR visualization of preprocedural MR images was performed before embolization. Procedural metrics including catheterization time and radiation exposure were compared vs a prospective cohort of 16 rats in which embolization was performed without AR. An additional cohort of 15 retrospective cases was identified and combined with the prospective control cohort (n = 31) to improve statistical power., RESULTS: A 37% reduction in fluoroscopy time, from 11.7 min to 7.4 minutes, was observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .12); however, when compared with combined prospective and retrospective controls, the reduction in fluoroscopy time from 14.1 min to 7.4 minutes (48%) was significant (P = .01). A 27% reduction in total catheterization time, from 42.7 minutes to 31.0 minutes, was also observed with AR when compared prospectively, which did not reach statistical significance (P = .11). No significant differences were seen in dose-area product or air kerma prospectively., CONCLUSIONS: Three-dimensional AR visualization of preprocedural imaging may aid in the reduction of procedural metrics in a preclinical model of transarterial embolization. These data support the need for further studies to evaluate the potential of AR in endovascular oncologic interventions. Copyright © 2020 SIR. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1006,"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for maxillary bone radiation-induced injury: A 15-year single-center experience. Background: Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is used to treat chronic radiation tissue injury, clinical evidence supporting its use in maxillary bone osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to report our results of collected patient outcomes from a single center's large experience using HBOT to treat maxillary bone ORN. Method(s): From 1999 to 2015, 21 patients received treatment for maxillary bone ORN at our center. The medical records were retrospectively reviewed for the following variables: age, sex, comorbidities, tumor stage and site, previous surgery, previous radiotherapy or chemoradiation therapy, HBOT data, response to treatment and further management. Result(s): A positive clinical outcome from HBOT occurred in 85.7% of patients with ORN and was proven radiologically in 14 of 15 patients (93.3%). In 5 patients, reconstructive surgery was required thereafter. Conclusion(s): Controversy exists regarding the management of ORN of the maxillofacial skeleton.

1977,"Adjuvant chemoradiation versus chemotherapy for stage III gastric cancer after surgery with curative intent. Objective: Gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and surgery alone cannot guarantee satisfactory results. Both chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and chemotherapy (CT) are used in postoperative therapy. However, it is controversial whether CRT or CT is better after D2 lymphadenectomy. In this study we investigated the efficacy of adjuvant CRT versus CT in stage III gastric cancer patients treated with R0 gastrectomy and D2 lymph node dissection. Patients and Methods: Data from 92 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma and treated with surgery followed by adjuvant treatment were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified into two groups depending on type of adjuvant treatment such as CT (Arm A) and CRT (Arm B). Result(s): Twenty-one patients in Arm A and 71 patients in Arm B were included. Median age at diagnosis was 60 years. The median follow-up time was 30 months. No difference in local recurrence (14.3 vs 15.7%, P = 0.89), peritoneal recurrence (29.4 vs 23.5%, P = 0.62), and distant metastases rates (57.1 vs 45.1%, P = 0.42) were observed between the arms. Disease-free survival (DFS) rates did not differ between Arms A and B (26 and 22 months, P = 0.80) respectively. Median overall survival (OS) in Arm A was 29 months and it was 32 months for Arm B. There was no difference in 5-year OS and DFS between Arms A and B (23.8 vs 34.4%, P = 0.74; and 24.1 vs 32.9%, P = 0.80). Conclusion(s): Adjuvant CRT does not appear to improve clinical outcomes compared to adjuvant CT in this study and prospective studies are required to confirm these results.",Excluded
1367,"Symptomatic and quality of life changes after extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma. Background: Extrapleural pneumonectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma is considered an aggressive procedure, but symptomatic and quality of life changes are unknown. Method(s): Between 1997 and 2004, 16 consecutive patients underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy for mesothelioma followed by chemoradiotherapy. Tumor-related symptoms and quality of life (Short-Form-36 and St. George's questionnaires) were assessed pre, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively. Result(s): Thirty-day postoperative major morbidity was 31% with no mortality. At 3 months postoperatively, dyspnea improved in 10 patients (62%), pain in 12 (75%), cough in 10 (62%), fever in 11 (68%), Karnofsky-index in 10 (62%), Short-Form-36 physical-component-summary in 8, mental-component- summary in 5 and total St. George score in 8 (50%). At 1 year 10 (62%) patients were alive and majority of improved parameters were still stable. Thereafter they usually started to decline. Survival was influenced by nonepithelial histology (P < 0.01) and N2-disease (P < 0.01), which showed to be the only prognosticator at Cox regression (P < 0.0001, Odd ratio 5.4). Among symptomatic variables, a 3-month postoperative Short-Form-36 physical-component-summary above the median value correlated significantly with a better prognosis (P < 0.02). Conclusion(s): Extrapleural pneumonectomy may rapidly improve symptoms as well as quality of life, especially in physical domains. Other than biological factors, postoperative Short-Form-36 physical component as well, significantly influenced the prognosis. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
3456,"Stage-to-stage comparison of preoperative and postoperative chemoradiotherapy for T3 mid or distal rectal cancer. Purpose: To investigate, in a comparative analysis, the prognostic implications of postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) pathologic stage (ypStage) vs. postoperative pathologic stage (pStage) in rectal cancer. Methods and Materials: Between May 2001 and December 2006, 487 patients with T3 mid or distal rectal cancer were analyzed retrospectively. Concurrent CRT was administered preoperatively (n = 364, 74.7%) or postoperatively (n = 123, 25.3%). The radiation dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. All patients underwent a total mesorectal excision and received adjuvant chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in DFS, stratified by ypStage and pStage, were compared using the log-rank test. Result(s): For surviving patients, the median follow-up period was 68 months (range, 12-105 months). The 5-year local recurrence-free survival rate was not different, at 95.3% and 92.1% in preoperative and postoperative CRT groups, respectively (p = 0.402), but the 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rate was significantly different, at 81.6% (preoperative CRT) vs. 65.4% (postoperative CRT; p = 0.001). The 5-year DFS rate of 78.8% in the preoperative CRT group was significantly better than the 63.0% rate in the postoperative CRT group (p = 0.002). Post-CRT pathologic Stage 0-I occurred in 42.6% (155 of 364) of the patients with preoperative CRT. The 5-year DFS rates were 90.2% (ypStage 0-I), 83.5% (ypStage II), 77.3% (pStage II), 58.6% (ypStage III), and 54.7% (pStage III). The DFS rate of ypStage 0-I was significantly better than that of ypStage II or pStage II. Post-CRT pathologic Stage II and III had similar DFS, compared with pStage II and III, respectively. Conclusion(s): Disease-free survival predicted by each ypStage was similar to that predicted by the respective pStage. Improved DFS with preoperative vs. postoperative CRT was associated with the ypStage 0-I group that showed a similarly favorable outcome to pStage I rectal cancer. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1099,"Comparison of two new angiogenesis PET tracers 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2; in vivo imaging studies in human xenograft tumors. Introduction: The aim of this study was to synthesize and perform a side-by-side comparison of two new tumor-angiogenesis PET tracers 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 in vivo using human xenograft tumors in mice. Human radiation burden was estimated to evaluate potential for future use as clinical PET tracers for imaging of neo-angiogenesis. Method(s): A 68Ge/68Ga generator was used for the synthesis of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2. 68Ga and 64Cu labeled NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 tracers were administrated in nude mice bearing either human glioblastoma (U87MG) or human neuroendocrine (H727) xenograft tumors. PET/CT scans at 3 time points were used for calculating the tracer uptake in tumors (%ID/g), integrin alphaVbeta3 target specificity was shown by blocking with cold NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2, and biodistribution in normal organs were also examined. From biodistribution data in mice human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM software. Result(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 was synthesized with a radiochemical purity of 89%-99% and a specific activity (SA) of 16-153MBq/nmol. 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 had a purity of 92%-99% and an SA of 64-78MBq/nmol.Both tracers showed similar uptake in xenograft tumors 1. h after injection (U87MG: 2.23 vs. 2.31%ID/g; H727: 1.53 vs. 1.48%ID/g). Both RGD dimers showed similar tracer uptake in non-tumoral tissues and a human radiation burden of less than 10. mSv with an administered dose of 200. MBq was estimated. Conclusion(s): 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 and 64Cu-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 can be easily synthesized and are both promising candidates for PET imaging of integrin alphaVbeta3 positive tumor cells. 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 showed slightly more stable tumor retention. With the advantage of in-house commercially 68Ge/68Ga generators, 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 may be the best choice for future clinical PET imaging in humans. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2530,"Radiation-induced oesophagitis in lung cancer patients. Is susceptibility for neutropenia a risk factor?. BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced oesophagitis is a major side effect of concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A strong association between neutropenia and oesophagitis was previously shown, but external validation and further elucidation of the possible mechanisms are lacking., METHODS AND PATIENTS: A total of 119 patients were included at two institutions. The concurrent group comprised 34 SCLC patients treated with concurrent carboplatin and etoposide, and concurrent chest irradiation, and 36 NSCLC patients with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide, and concurrent radiotherapy, while the sequential group comprised 49 NSCLC patients received sequential cisplatin and gemcitabine, and radiotherapy., RESULTS: Severe neutropenia was very frequent during concurrent chemoradiation (grade: 4 41.4%) and during induction chemotherapy in sequentially treated patients (grade 4: 30.6%), but not during radiotherapy (only 4% grade 1). In the concurrent group, the odds ratios of grade 3 oesophagitis vs. neutropenia were the following: grade 2 vs. grade 0/1: 5.60 (95% CI 1.55-20.26), p = 0.009; grade 3 vs. grade 0/1: 10.40 (95% CI 3.19-33.95); p = 0.0001; grade 4 vs. grade 0/1: 12.60 (95% CI 4.36-36.43); p < 0.00001. There was no correlation between the occurrence of neutropenia during induction chemotherapy and acute oesophagitis during or after radiotherapy alone. In the univariate analysis, total radiation dose (p < 0.001), overall treatment time of radiotherapy (p < 0.001), mean oesophageal dose (p = 0.038) and neutropenia (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with the development of oesophagitis. In a multivariate analysis, only neutropenia remained significant (p = 0.023)., CONCLUSION: We confirm that neutropenia is independently correlated with oesophagitis in concurrent chemoradiation, but that the susceptibility for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is not associated with radiation-induced oesophagitis. Further studies focusing on the underlying mechanisms are thus warranted.",Excluded
3329,"Comparison of a reduced radiation fluoroscopy protocol to conventional fluoroscopy during uncomplicated ureteroscopy. Objectives: Although the long-term effects of radiation exposure are not completely predictable, the principle of keeping radiation exposure ""as low as reasonably achievable"" should be used. The purpose of this study was to compare fluoroscopy times before and after the implementation of a protocol designed to reduce fluoroscopy usage during ureteroscopy. Method(s): A retrospective review was conducted of 300 consecutive ureteroscopy patients at a single institution. Patients undergoing simple ureteroscopy without ancillary procedures or balloon dilation were further evaluated to determine the effect of a reduced fluoroscopy protocol. The protocol included several measures, including use of a laser-guided C-arm, use of a designated fluoroscopy technician and substitution of visual for fluoroscopic cues during ureteroscopy. Fluoroscopy times were compared between groups using a paired t test with P <.05 considered significant. Result(s): Ureteroscopy cases before protocol implementation (n = 30) were compared with procedures after implementation (n = 30). Stone size and location were similar between groups. Protocol implementation significantly reduced the mean fluoroscopy exposure from 86.1 seconds (range 30-300) to 15.5 seconds (range 0-54; P <.001). There was no difference in mean operative time (74.2 vs 65.1 minutes; P =.14), or complications (2 patients vs 2 patients; P = 1) between groups. No complication in either group could be ascribed to the fluoroscopic technique. Conclusion(s): The reduced fluoroscopy protocol resulted in an 82% reduction in fluoroscopy time without altering patient outcomes. These simple radiation-reducing techniques add no technical difficulty and improve safety for the patient, surgeon, and operating room staff by lowering radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3622,"Incidental gonadal radiation exposure in the prophylactic treatment of heterotopic ossification. Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy is commonly used for heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis after the orthopedic repair of fractures involving the hip and femur. Given the young age of many of these patients presenting for treatment and the proximity of the reproductive organs to tissue requiring radiation therapy, incidental radiation exposure to the gonads must be considered for potential fertility issues. The purpose of this study was to report dosimetric gonadal exposure among a large cohort of patients who underwent 3-dimensional simulation and radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis. Materials/Methods: A total of 45 patients (38 males; 7 females) were identified that underwent volumetric CT-planned radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis using a single fraction dose of 700 cGy. The median age was 22 years (range, 12 - 55 years). Treatment plans were generated with the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA) with heterogeneity corrections accounted for via convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithm. Treatments were delivered post-operatively within 48 hours using opposed AP/PA fields that generally included the surgical prosthesis as well as the femoral head, ischial ramus, and greater/lesser trochanters. Three male patients received bilateral radiation for fractures involving both hips. The simulation CT scans were retrieved from archives, and the testicles and ovaries were delineated as paired structures on 3 millimeter axial sections so that dose-volume characteristics could be determined. Result(s): The proportion of male patients receiving ipsilateral testicular doses (maximum) greater than 15 cGy, 50 cGy, and 100 cGy was 63%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. Another 20% of male patients had both testicles exposed to maximum doses greater than 15 cGy, the number commonly cited to cause sperm abnormalities. The 3 men undergoing bilateral radiation received an average maximal testicular dose of 422 cGy (range, 187 - 686 cGy). Among female patients, 86% received maximal ipsilateral ovarian doses over 15 cGy. One of the seven women received a dose exceeding 15 cGy to both ovaries (778 cGy and 31.5 cGy). Conclusion(s): Gonadal doses exceeding historically recommended tolerances can result in patients undergoing radiation for HO prophylaxis. Scrotal shields, informing patients about possible fertility issues, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative to radiation therapy should be considered as appropriate in the management of this benign condition.",Excluded
2565,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal carcinoma: Baseline hematologic parameters influencing outcomes. Background: The link between the blood count and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is indisputable and well described. Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From 2009-2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study and analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings. Blood count levels which included RBC (red blood cells), Hb (hemoglobin), PLT (platelet count), neutrophil count, WBC (white blood cells), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) were analyzed in relation to tumor downstaging, pCR (pathologic complete response), OS (overall survival), and DFS (disease-free survival). Result(s): Hb levels were associated with a response in logistic regression analysis: pCR (p = 0.05; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07); T downstaging (p = 0.006; OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05); N downstaging (p = 0.09; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); T or N downstaging (p = 0.007; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07); T and N downstaging (p = 0.02; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); Hb and RBC were the most significant parameters influencing OS; PLT was a negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS (p = 0.008 for OS); an NLR value of 2.8 was associated with the greatest significance for OS (p = 0.03) and primary tumor downstaging (p = 0.02).

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether an inverse association exists between latitude, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, modeled 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and incidence rates of cancer of the brain., METHODS: Associations of latitude and UVB irradiance with age-standardized incidence rates of cancer of the brain were analyzed for 175 countries while controlling for proportion of population overweight, energy from animal sources, fish consumption, cigarette and alcohol consumption and per capita health expenditures, using multiple regression. Serum 25(OH)D levels were modeled for each country, and their association with brain cancer also was determined., RESULTS: The incidence rates of brain cancer were higher at higher latitudes (R(2) for males = 0.45, p <= 0.0001; R(2) for females = 0.35, p < 0.0001). After adjustment for potential confounders, UVB irradiance (p <= 0.0001) and modeled serum 25(OH)D were inversely associated with incidence rates., CONCLUSIONS: Countries with low solar UVB irradiance and estimated mean serum 25(OH)D levels generally had higher age-standardized incidence rates of brain cancer. Since this was an ecological study, further research would be worthwhile on the association of prediagnostic serum 25(OH)D with incidence rate in studies of cohorts of individuals.

Bone mass was measured with DXA at lumbar spine and femoral neck and the presence of fractures was evaluated with X-ray of thoracic and lumbar spine. All patients performed twice, 1 mg overnight dexametasone suppression test (DST) and, as confirmatory, 2day low-dose DST for diagnosing hypercortisolism. Result(s): We enrolled 101 fractured patients (75 females, 26 males), aged 65 +/- 10.3 years. Five out of 101 (5.0%) patients were diagnosed as LSH. Fifty-five (54.5%) out of 101 were hypertensive, 57 (56.4%) dyslipidemic, 17 (16.8%) hyperglicaemic, 28(27.7%) obese patients. LSH tended to be associated to blood hypertension [5/5 vs 50/96 (Fisher exact test, p = 0.06) hypertensive patients]. Four out five LSH patients were hypogonadic. Conclusion(s): Our study confirms that a nonnegligible percentage of fractured subjects actually presents an unrecognized hypercortisolism. Accordingly, regardless of age, we suggest to screen for hypercortisolism all patients with established osteoporosis and in particular hypertensive subjects.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3087,"Chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection: an experience with 22 patients. The authors present their experience of chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection in 22 patients. The patients are from a series of 80 patients treated by chest wall resection from 1967 to 1989. Whether performed on breasts still in place, for recurrent disease, or for radiation-induced lesions (which are often associated), the defect created by complete resection of the chest wall layers causes difficulties. Large cutaneous flaps, often including the opposite breast were used at the beginning of the series. Then came omentum associated to Mersilene mesh and myocutaneous flaps. The results, in terms of comfort and local control are acceptable, even though surgery is only palliative for cancer patients. We feel that full thickness chest wall resection is the only effective treatment for some primary and recurrent malignant tumors and for extensive thoracic radionecroses. Such procedures are designed to improve the patient's quality of life even if they do not actually prolong survival. The goals guiding the reconstruction programme are: (1) the restoration of a stable parietal rigidity; and (2) the reconstruction of long lasting superficial layers.",Excluded
3358,"Experience with wound complications after surgery for sacral tumors. Purpose: The aim of this article is to summarize our experience in treating sacral wound complications after sacrectomy. We focus, in particular, on factors associated with wound complications, including surgical site infection (SSI) and wound dehiscence. Method(s): The definition of SSI devised by Horgan et al. was applied. Wound dehiscence was defined as a wound showing breakdown in the absence of clinical signs meeting the diagnostic standard for SSI. Between September 1997 and August 2009, 387 patients with a sacral tumor underwent sacrectomy performed by the same team of surgeons and were followed up for >=12 months. Potential risk factors were evaluated for univariate associations with SSI and wound complications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to identify the combined effects of several risk factors. Result(s): Of the 387 wounds studied, 274 healed uneventfully, and 113 (29.2 %) broke down because of infection or dehiscence. Fifty-one (13.2 %) patients developed a postoperative SSI, and 62 (16.0 %) patients developed wound dehiscence. Gram-negative bacteria grew in 45 cultures (91.8 %) and included 38 cases of Escherichia coli. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, longer duration of surgery, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing an SSI. Previous radiation, rectum rupture, age <40 years, history of diabetes mellitus, maximum tumor diameter >=10 cm, and instrumentation used were risk factors for wound complications. Conclusion(s): The incidence of wound complications is not so high at a musculoskeletal tumor center with surgeons experienced in treating sacral tumors. Controlling for these risk factors when possible may improve clinical outcomes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

3590,"Somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus and the dorsal cochlear nucleus hypothesis. Purpose: Of all nonauditory sensory systems, only the somatosensory system seems to be related to tinnitus (eg, temporomandibular joint syndrome and whiplash). The purpose of this study is to describe the distinguishing characteristics of tinnitus associated with somatic events and to use these characteristics to develop a neurological model of somatic tinnitus. Material(s) and Method(s): Case series. Result(s): Some patients with tinnitus, but no other hearing complaints, share several clinical features including (1) an associated somatic disorder of the head or upper neck, (2) localization of the tinnitus to the ear ipsilateral to the somatic disorder, (3) no vestibular complaints, and (4) no abnormalities on neurological examination. Pure tone and speech audiometry of the 2 ears is always symmetric and usually within normal limits. Based on these clinical features, it is proposed that somatic (craniocervical) tinnitus, like otic tinnitus, is caused by disinhibition of the ipsilateral dorsal cochlear nucleus. Nerve fibers whose cell bodies lie in the ipsilateral medullary somatosensory nuclei mediate this effect. These neurons receive inputs from nearby spinal trigeminal tract, fasciculus cuneatus, and facial, vagal, and glossopharyngeal nerve fibers innervating the middle and external ear. Conclusion(s): Somatic (craniocervical) modulation of the dorsal cochlear nucleus may account for many previously poorly understood aspects of tinnitus and suggests novel tinnitus treatments.",Excluded
2695,"Eosinophilic interleukin 5 (IL-5) transgenic mice: eosinophil activity and impaired clearance of Schistosoma mansoni. Eosinophilia is a feature common to many invasive helminth infections and eosinophils are often considered to be effector cells in immunity to helminths. This study examined the possible influence of constitutive eosinophilia on the clearance of Schistosoma mansoni infections in mice. Eosinophils from interleukin-5 transgenic mice exhibit normal ultrastructure and function with regard to phagocytosis and killing of bacteria and responses to chemotactic stimuli. IL-5 transgenics and non-transgenic littermates were immunized once or four (hyperimmunization) times with irradiated cercariae of S. mansoni. Animals were challenged percutaneously with unirradiated cercariae one month after their last exposure to irradiated parasites. One month after challenge transgenic animals, whether unimmunized, vaccinated or hypervaccinated, carried significantly more liver-stage parasites than non-transgenic animals. These results suggest that although eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic mice are functional for a number of key parameters, large numbers of eosinophils and/or high levels of IL-5 may in some way impair clearance of S. mansoni. A re-evaluation of the roles of eosinophils and IL-5 in infections with this and other parasites may therefore be warranted.",Excluded

1119,"Synovial sarcoma presenting as soft tissue rheumatic syndrome: A challenge for the clinician. Purpose: Despite of its name, synovial sarcoma (SS) does not have synovial origin; it arises from the primitive mesenchyme of the tendon sheath and fascial aponeurosis. SS is frequently misdiagnosed as a benign soft tissue condition. Will be described clinical and histopathological features of patients with diagnosis of SS, emphasizing those manifestations that may lead to misdiagnosis of soft tissue rheumatism. Method(s): A retrospective chart, imaging and pathological review of consecutive histopathological proved cases of SS, registered between January 2000 to December 2008 at Pathology department. Result(s): 27 patients (17 male 63%; 10 female, 37%). The average age at diagnosis was 28 years (11 - 63 years). Anatomical regions involved were, lower limb in 93% (foot 11, 41%; ankle 4, 15%; knee 4, 15%; thigh 4, 15%; inguinal region 2, 7%) and upper limb in 2, 7%; arm and forearm,). Signs and symptoms at presentation were: pain in all cases, palpable deep-seated swelling or periarticular mass in 22 (81%), decrease range of joint motion in 44%, weight loss in 18%, skin color changes in 7%, and muscle weakness in 4%. Eleven (34%) were initially diagnosed as benign rheumatologic conditions: synovitis in 3 (11%); fasciitis in 2 (7%); Mortonxs neuroma; arthrofibrosis; chronic bursitis, synovial cyst, bunionette, and tarsal tunnel syndrome 1 (4%) instance each. The time elapsed since onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 40 months (1 - 156 months). The more advantageos imaging studies that helped defining the presence of a soft-tissue tumor were MRI, CT-scan, scintigraphy and X-rays. In all cases a biopsy was necessary to confirm diagnosis. Surgical treatment was: amputation in 11 patients (41%), block resection in 6 (22%) and marginal resection in 5 (18.5%). Five patients (18.5%) refused surgical treatment. The size of the tumors ranged from 1-to 12 cm. Histological subtype was identified as monophasic (24/89%) and biphasic (3/11%). Patients were classified according to the TNM system as follows: T1N0M0 19(70%), T2N0M0 2(7%) T2N1M0 1(4%) and T2N1M1 5(19%). They also were categorized according to the IRSG classification as type I in 18 patients (67%), type II in 2 (7%), type III in 6 (22%) and type IV in 1 case (4%). Ten (37%) patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The average follow-up was 51 months (6-96), local recurrences and metastases were in 7 patients (26%). Fifteen (55.5%) patients were alive and disease free. Conclusion(s): It is essential that the Rheumatologist retain awarness of SS, particularly in young male patients presenting with slow growth, palpable, deep-seated soft tissue swelling or mass in close proximity to joints of the lower extremities. SS should be included in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue rheumatic syndromes.",Excluded
3588,"Pulmonary venous anatomy imaging with low-dose, prospectively ECG-triggered, high-pitch 128-slice dual-source computed tomography. BACKGROUND: The efforts to reduce radiation from cardiac computed tomography (CT) are essential. Using a prospectively triggered, high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, we aim to determine the radiation dose and image quality in patients undergoing pulmonary vein (PV) imaging., METHODS AND RESULTS: In 94 patients (61+/-9 years; 71% male) who underwent 128-slice dual-source CT (pitch 3.4), radiation dose and image quality were assessed and compared between 69 patients with sinus rhythm and 25 patients with atrial fibrillation. Radiation dose was compared in a subset of 19 patients with prior retrospective or prospectively triggered CT PV scans without high pitch. In a subset of 18 patients with prior magnetic resonance imaging for PV assessment, PV anatomy and scan duration were compared with high-pitch CT. Using the high-pitch protocol, total effective radiation dose was 1.4 (1.3, 1.9) mSv, with no difference between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation (1.4 versus 1.5 mSv; P=0.22). No high-pitch CT scans were nondiagnostic or had poor image quality. Radiation dose was reduced with high-pitch (1.6 mSv) compared with standard protocols (19.3 mSv; P<0.0001). This radiation dose reduction was seen with sinus rhythm (1.5 versus 16.7 mSv; P<0.0001) but was more profound with atrial fibrillation (1.9 versus 27.7 mSv; P=0.039). There was excellent agreement of PV anatomy (kappa 0.84; P<0.0001) and a shorter CT scan duration (6 minutes) compared with magnetic resonance imaging (41 minutes; P<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Using a high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, PV imaging can be performed with minimal radiation dose, short scan acquisition, and excellent image quality in patients with sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. This protocol highlights the success of new cardiac CT technology to minimize radiation exposure, giving clinicians a new low-dose imaging alternative to assess PV anatomy.",Excluded
1602,"Functional Preservation after Planned Partial Resection Followed by Gamma Knife Radiosurgery for Large Vestibular Schwannomas. Objective The treatment goal for vestibular schwannomas (VS) has been changed from total removal of the tumor to functional preservation with long-term tumor growth control. The small- to medium-sized VS can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery, but large VS require surgical decompression for the relief of cerebellar dysfunction and increased intracranial pressure. We have been performing planned partial surgical resections followed by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) for large VS. Here, we evaluate a recent series of such cases from the standpoint of functional outcomes. Methods From January 2000 to May 2013, we treated 40 patients with large unilateral VS (maximum tumor diameter at least 25 mm) with planned partial tumor removal followed by GKS for functional preservation. The median maximum diameter of the tumors was 32.5 mm (range 25-52 mm). All patients underwent surgery via the retrosigmoid approach, and tumors situated on the ventral and in the internal auditory canal intentionally were not removed, thus preserving cranial nerve functions. GKS was performed 1-12 months after surgical resection (median interval 3 months). The median tumor volume at GKS was 3.3 cm3 (range 0.4-10.4 cm3) and the median prescribed dose was 12 Gy (range 10-12 Gy). The median follow-up period after GKS was 65 months (18-156 months). Results At the final follow-up, facial nerve preservation (House-Brackmann grade I-II) was achieved in 38 patients (95%; House-Brackmann grade I: 92.5%, II: 2.5%). Among the 14 patients with preoperative pure tone average (PTA) less than 50 dB, 6 of them (42.9%) maintained PTA less than 50 dB at the last follow-up. Two patients improved from severe hearing loss to PTA less than 50 dB (1 patient after surgery and 1 patient one and half years after GKS). Five- and 10-year tumor growth control occurred in 86% of patients. Four patients (10%) required salvage surgery; the predictive factor was tumor volume greater than 6 cm3 at GKS (P = 0.01). Conclusions Planned partial removal of large VS followed by GKS achieved a high rate of facial nerve and hearing preservation. To achieve long-term tumor growth control, the tumor volume at GKS after planned partial surgical resection should be smaller than 6 cm3. Our results revealed that patients with hearing preservation postoperatively have a chance of maintaining hearing function, even though the possibility exists of deterioration by long-term follow-up after surgical intervention and GKS. Furthermore, some patients with severe hearing loss before treatment have the chance of hearing improvement, even those with large VS.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3315,"The association of residential altitude on the molecular profile and survival of melanoma: Results of an interreg study. Cutaneous melanoma (CM) incidence is rising worldwide and is the primary cause of death from skin disease in the Western world. Personal risk factors linked to environmental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are well-known etiological factors contributing to its development. Nevertheless, UVR can contribute to the development of CM in different patterns and to varying degrees. The present study aimed at investigating whether altitude of residence can contribute to the development of specific types of CM and/or influence its progression. To this aim, 306 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from primary CM diagnosed in different geographical areas were submitted to B-RAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and N-RAS proto-oncogene GTPase (NRAS) mutational status detection and mRNA and miRNA profiling by qPCR. Genes were chosen for their functions in specific processes, such as immune response (CD2, PDL1, or CD274) and pigmentation (MITF, TYRP1, and TRPM1). Furthermore, four microRNAs, namely miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-204-5p, and miR-211-5p, were included in the profiling. Our results highlight differences in the gene expression profile of primary CM with respect to the geographical area and the altitude of residence. Melanoma-specific survival was influenced by the gene expression of mRNA and miRNAs and varied with the altitude of patients' residence. In detail, TYRP1 and miR-204-5p were highly expressed in patients living at higher altitudes, unlike miR-150-5p, miR-155-5p, and miR-211-5p. Since miRNAs are highly regulated by reactive oxygen species, it is possible that different regulatory mechanisms characterize CMs at different altitudes due to the different environment and UVR intensity.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Aim: Parkinson's disease (PD) patients frequently present visual hallucinations (VHs) that have been associated with depression, old age, and cognitive impairment. Sleep abnormalities are also related to these factors. The aim of this study is to evaluate risk factors, particularly sleep alterations, associated with VHs in PD., Methods: This is a cross-sectional evaluation of consecutive patients from a Movement Disorder's clinics. Patients were clinically evaluated, and behavioral questionnaires were applied in a face-to-face interview., Results: Among 100 PD patients (67% male, mean age 5 65.0 +/- 10.4), VHs were present in 28% of cases; individuals with VHs had worse sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire Index) and more severe sleep disturbances [Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS)]. Logistic regression analysis showed that vivid dreams and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) I scores (i.e., mentation, behavior, and mood symptoms) are independently associated with VHs. Our data show that the presence of vivid dreams is associated with VHs in PD and reaffirm that VHs are linked to cognitive impairment., Conclusions: Investigating vivid dreams may help the identification of VHs in PD. Identifying vivid dreams can be hard considering that patients may fail to report symptoms for the fear of the stigma associated with psychosis and dementia.Copyright © W. S.

1090,"Gamma Knife radiosurgery for the treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas. Background: Intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVF) may present a treatment challenge. Endovascular embolization is in most cases the first line of treatment but does not always achieve cure. Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery represents an alternative treatment option, and the purpose of this study was to further evaluate its utility. Method(s): We reviewed all cases of DAVF treated between 2009 and 2016 at our institution with GK radiosurgery independently, or following failed/refused endovascular or surgical management. Patients' clinical files, radiological images, catheter angiograms, and surgical DAVF disconnection reports were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): Sixteen DAVF (14 patients) treated by GK radiosurgery were identified. Eleven fistulae were aggressive and five were benign. Marginal doses ranged from 15 to 25 Gy. Target volumes ranged from 0.04 to 4.47 cm3. In all symptomatic patients, GK treatment resulted in symptom palliation. In 13/15 lesions, cure of symptoms (86.0%) was reported. One lesion was asymptomatic. Angiographic cure was achieved in eight cases (50%), small residual DAVF occurred in four, and four were unchanged. One patient developed headache that resolved at one year. No hemorrhage occurred during the follow-up period. There was no significant association between Borden type and cure rate. Prior failed endovascular treatment and small target volume were associated with lower rates of cure. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic radiosurgery is viable treatment for DAVF. It is very effective in palliating symptoms as a de novo approach or adjunctive to endovascular therapy. In our experience it is only somewhat effective in achieving complete angiographic cure.Copyright © The Author(s) 2016.",Excluded
379,"Remotely Guided Breast Sonography for Long-Term Space Missions: A Case Report and Discussion. Background: Space radiation can cause different types of cancers in crewmembers, especially during long-term space missions. Introduction: To date, a complete bilateral breast ultrasound has not been performed at the International Space Station (ISS). A breast screening imaging technique could be a useful tool for early identification of breast cancer in astronauts. We hypothesized that breast ultrasound performed by a crewmember while being remotely guided by a specialist from the ground could be an essential tool for medical diagnosis in space. This project aimed to test an ultrasound screening protocol for breast tissue using real-time remotely guided telemedicine techniques. Materials and Methods: One female volunteer, with no previous medical experience, performed a self-scanned bilateral breast ultrasound exam guided by a remote sonographer. Dynamic ultrasound images were collected using a 25 mm broadband linear array transducer. To simulate fluid shift on the volunteer during microgravity, the bed was tilted -6. Results: Recorded ultrasound images were analyzed by radiologists, comparing the findings with a gold standard. The experiment demonstrated that real-time remotely guided sonography exam is feasible and can yield meaningful clinical results. Discussion: This case study showed that remotely guided breast ultrasound can be performed and might become an important tool for diagnosis of breast cancer in space missions. Conclusion: The results cannot be generalized based on one subject, and additional research is warranted in this area in addition to its validation on the ISS. This technique, however, has potential for use as part of preventive medicine procedures for long-term space missions at the ISS, and eventually for human settlements on the Moon and Mars.

Aims: To prospectively analyze the objective voice quality before and after radiotherapy (RT) for early glottic cancer and to evaluate the role of different factors that may affect it. Method(s): Patients with T1-T2N0M0 glottic cancer underwent voice quality assessment before treatment and after radical RT. Post-RT voice quality was compared to the voice at diagnosis and the voice of healthy individuals used as controls. A comprehensive set of voice parameters were measured. The effects of age, smoking history, T stage, anterior commissure (AC) involvement, radiation dose, fractionation and volumes on pre-treatment and post-treatment voice quality were analyzed. Result(s): The voice quality data of 50 patients were analyzed. Following treatment, there was a significant improvement in the majority of measured parameters. However, perturbation and HNR remained inferior compared to controls. A history of smoking, AC involvement and larger RT volumes resulted in poorer voice parameters following RT. There was no significant impact of age alone. T2 tumors had an inferior voice quality before treatment, but did not remain inferior following RT. Hypofractionated RT did not show any negative impact. Conclusion(s): There is a considerable improvement of voice quality following RT. Several factors may have specific effects on pre-treatment and post-treatment voice. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Background Role of pre-cut fistulotomy in reducing fluoroscopy time and radiation dose in difficult selective biliary cannulation is unknown. Methods This is a prospective randomized controlled trial where patients with difficult biliary cannulation were randomized into 2 groups, viz, Group I -Early pre-cut fistulotomy after difficult biliary cannulation at 5 minutes and Group II- Late pre-cut fistulotomy after failure of conventional methods of selective biliary cannulation for 15 minutes. We compared the success rates of selective biliary cannulation along with fluoroscopy time and radiation dose, the complication rates, need for repeat Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) and need for other interventions in early and late pre-cut fistulotomy. Results Of the 130 eligible patients screened, 40 patients were randomized. The technical success was comparable between early and late group. The ERC time was less and the fluoroscopy time and radiation dose were significantly less in the early group (4 minutes [3, 6] vs. 15 minutes [8, 28], p=0.001) and (1.35 mGy [0.90, 1.63] vs. 2.40 mGy [1.58, 3.25], p=0.010) respectively.

In the Ames test for mutagenicity, 2-F-A-85380 was without effect in five bacterial strains. No evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes occurred in either 2-day acute (0.4-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) or 14-day expanded acute (40-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) toxicity studies in mice. Similarly, hematology and serum chemistry values in rhesus monkeys administered 60 nmol/kg i.v. were not affected over 14 days. Like nicotine, 2-F-A-85380 produced convulsions in mice at very high doses. The ED(50) value of 2-F-A-85380 for eliciting tonic-clonic convulsions (5.0 micromol/kg i.v.) was nearly 4 times greater than that of nicotine (ED(50) = 1.4 micromol/kg i.v.). Lower doses of 2-F-A-85380 (30-300 nmol/kg i.v.) and nicotine (20-400 nmol/kg i.v.) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility in rats. Notably, the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the rat electrocardiogram were unaffected by either drug. Dosimetry studies indicated that the urinary bladder wall was the critical organ and total radiation exposure was within acceptable limits.

1890,"Design planning target volumes (PTVs) in intensity-modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may help to diminish radiation-induced normal tissue damage and improve quality of life of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. However, highly conformal treatment techniques commonly establish steep dose gradients between tumor and normal tissues, therefore, daily setup variations can significantly compromise the ultimate precision of idealized IMRT delivery. This study was to investigate the setup accuracy of thermoplastic masks used for immobilizing NPC patients treated by simultaneous integrated boost IMRT, and to determine adequate margins to account for those uncertainties. METHOD(S):Nineteen patients with early stage (T1-2N0M0) NPC received CT scan weekly during their 6-week treatment course of fractionated IMRT. A total of 85 scanning parameters were obtained. The differences in anatomic landmark coordinates in 3-dimensional directions between daily setup and the first day setup were calculated through comparing the CT images with Osiris software. RESULT(S):Mean target isocenter translation was (0.89+/-0.69) mm in x-direction, (0.82+/-0.79) mm in y-direction, and (0.95+/-1.24) mm in z-direction. The systematic errors were 0.94 mm, 1.00 mm, and 1.32 mm. The random errors were 0.87 mm, 0.80 mm, and 1.04 mm. The mean total magnitude vector of isocenter motion was 1.87 mm; the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 2.03-7.24 mm. CONCLUSION(S): During IMRT for early stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma, setting appropriate margin of planning target volume (PTV) by widening 3 mm from clinical target volume (CTV) in x, y, z directions will be sufficient to compensate for the dosimetric uncertainty of target areas due to patient setup error. The measured data in the present study should enable the user of this kind of thermoplastic mask to assign appropriate margins for the generation of planning target volumes (PTVs).",Excluded

Purpose: To identify the tolerance of radiation with a high prescribed dose and predictors for the development of intrathoracic stomach toxicity in patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) after esophagectomy followed by gastric conduit reconstruction. Methods and Materials: From 2011 to 2013, 105 patients after esophagectomy were treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The intrathoracic stomach was outlined with the calculation of a dose-volume histogram (DVH) for the initial intended treatment of 6020 cGy or 6300 cGy. The volume of the intrathoracic stomach receiving each dose was recorded at 10-Gy intervals between 10 and 40 Gy and at 5-Gy intervals between 40 and 60 Gy. The grade of toxicities was defined by the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0. Result(s): The mean and maximum doses of the intrathoracic stomach were 2449 +/- 986 cGy and 6519 +/- 406 cGy, respectively. Sixteen (15.2%) and three (2.9%) experienced Common Toxicity Criteria Grade 2 and Grade 3 acute gastric toxicity. There were no Grade 4 toxicities. Fourteen patients (13.3%) exhibited late gastric complications possibly related to radiation. The volume percent of the intrathoracic stomach receiving at least 50 Gy (V50) was strongly associated with the degree of toxicity (p = 0.024, respectively). Multivariate analysis of patient and treatmentrelated factors revealed no other significant predictors of severe toxicities. Conclusion(s): The intrathoracic stomach is well tolerated with a high-dose irradiation for patients with esophageal SCC receiving radiotherapy after esophagectomy. A strong dose-volume relationship exists for the development of Grade 2 acute intrathoracic stomach toxicity in our study.",Excluded
2416,"Empty peek cages in ACDF: Does partial titanium coating improve the radiographic fusion?. BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is an effective standard surgical treatment for radiculopathy and myelopathy. Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a popular and advantageous material for the cages used in ACDF, but clinical studies have shown that radiographic fusion is slower with PEEK cages than with titanium cages. In a previous large prospective multicenter study, we showed that empty PEEK cages have slow and insufficient radiographic fusion and that failure to achieve complete radiographic fusion results in less improvement in pain and disability. It was hypothesized that a PEEK cage coated with titanium on the top and bottom surfaces would achieve better radiographic fusion rates than an otherwise identical uncoated PEEK cage. PURPOSE: To determine if a PEEK cage with a titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces achieves better radiographic fusion than an identical PEEK cage without any titanium coating. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Prospective multicenter single-arm clinical trial, with matched controls from another prospective multicenter singlearm clinical trial. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty patients receiving single-level ACDF, for radiculopathy or myelopathy at a single level C3-4 to C7-T1, and 50 matched controls selected from a similar clinical trial. This interim analysis presents results from the first 28 cases and 50 controls, and the presentation at the Annual Meeting will present the full final results of all 50 patients and 50 controls. OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiographic fusion was assessed on X-ray images by two independent investigators for three aspects-bony bridging, subsidence/migration, and range of motion, yielding a 0-7 score, with scores of 6 and 7 defined as ""complete fusion."" Clinical outcomes included Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI) for functioning, and Odom's criterion. METHOD(S): Single-level ACDF was performed using stand-alone empty PEEK cages with versus without titanium coating on the top and bottom surfaces, without postoperative bracing. Follow-up assessments were made at 6, 12, and 18 months. RESULT(S): The rate of complete fusion for PEEK+Ti cages versus uncoated PEEK controls was: 50.0% vs 40.0% at 6 months, 75.0% vs 72.0% at 12 months, and 78.5% vs 84.0% at 18 months, and there was no statistically significant difference between these rates. There was also no statistically significant difference between the two groups for the amount of subsidence at any follow-up. Pain (VAS) and functioning (NDI) improved in both groups with no statistically significant difference between them. The fusion status correlated significantly (p<.05) with VAS at 6 and 18 months and with NDI at 12 and 18 months. The Odom's criterion at 18 months was the same in both groups: ""good"" or ""excellent"" for 89% of PEEK+Ti patients vs 90% for PEEK patients (p=.90). CONCLUSION(S): This interim analysis from our study rejects our hypothesis that titanium coating of PEEK cages at the bearing surface (cage/ vertebra interface) would improve the low fusion rate of empty PEEK cages: neither the speed nor the ultimate frequency of fusion was significantly different between the cases and matched controls. Our study suggests that endplate/interface coating alone does not improve fusion. Perhaps a possible immune response to the remaining uncovered PEEK at the lateral and inner cage surfaces may be a reason for the slow and insufficient rate of fusion. PEEK cages fully coated with titanium should be tested next.",Excluded
2582,"Neurotrophic keratitis after transscleral diode laser cyclophotocoagulation. OBJECTIVE: To study the relationship between treatment with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and development a neurotrophic keratitis due to the damage of the sensitive corneal innervation., METHODS: A study was conducted on 5 eyes of 5 patients who were treated with diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and soon developed neurotrophic ulcers. Personal characteristics of the patients were collected, as well as refraction and risk factors for corneal hypoesthesia, and the parameters of the laser used in the surgery., RESULTS: It was found that the 5 patients had predisposing factors of corneal hypoesthesia prior to surgery (chronic use of topical beta blockers, surgery with corneal incisions, diabetes mellitus, or corneal dystrophies); however none had developed neurotrophic keratitis until the cyclophotocoagulation was performed. It also showed that 4 of them were highly myopic, and they all were treated with high laser parameters (with an average of 2880 mW for 3s at an average surface of 275degree), triggering neurotrophic ulcers between 10 and 35 days after surgery., CONCLUSION: Neurotrophic keratitis is a rare complication that can occur after diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, secondary to the damage of the long ciliary nerves. The emergence of this disorder can be triggered by the existence of previous risk factors, including high myopia, thus it is important to respect the recommended treatment parameters to prevent the development of this disorder.

2430,"Corazonin- and PDF-immunoreactivities in the cephalic ganglia of termites. Antisera against the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) and corazonin (Crz) reacted with distinct sets of neurons in the cephalic ganglia of termites. The locations of immunoreactive cells were similar but their numbers differed among the eight species examined: PDF-ir occurred in 0-6 cells in each optic lobe and 1-2 pairs of cells in the subosophageal ganglion (SOG), and Crz-ir in 0-2 pairs of cells in the pars intecerebralis, 3-14 cells in each lateral protocerebrum, and 0-6 pairs of cells in the SOG. Staining patterns were identical in the pseudergates, soldiers, and substitutive reproductives of Prorhinotermes simplex. Workers and soldiers were compared in the remaining 7 species. The only caste divergence was detected in Coptotermes formosanus, in which the soldiers differed from the workers by lack of 4 Crz-ir perikarya in the pars intercerebralis and occasionally also by the absence of 2 Crz-ir perikarya in the SOG. Diurnal changes in PDF-ir and Crz-ir were examined in P. simplex kept under long day (18:6 h light:darkness) or short day (10:14 h) photoperiods. No circadian fluctuations in the distribution or the intensity of immunostaining were found in the pseudergates and soldiers that were sacrificed in 4 h intervals or in the male and female substitutive reproductives examined in 6 h intervals. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

651,"Use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal cancer in Japan: analysis using a national database. BACKGROUND: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) yields better outcomes and fewer toxicities for radiation therapy (RT) of head and neck cancers (HNCs), including nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). IMRT is the standard RT treatment and has been widely adopted in Western countries to treat HNCs. However, its uptake in clinical practice among NPC patients has never been studied., METHODS: We investigated the use of IMRT for NPC using data from a nationwide cancer registry to describe the use of IMRT among NPC patients in Japan. We analyzed the data of patients with HNC, including NPC, who underwent IMRT between 2012 and 2014, as recorded in the hospital-based cancer registries linked with insurance claims. We calculated the proportion of patients with NPC who underwent IMRT at each hospital. To evaluate the use of IMRT for NPC, the IMRT use for NPC was compared with the proportion of patients with prostate cancer who underwent IMRT., RESULTS: Among 508 patients with NPC who underwent RT at one of 87 hospitals, 348 (69%) underwent IMRT. This proportion gradually increased between 2012 and 2014 (62%, 64% and 77%). Meanwhile, 4790 patients with prostate cancer (90%) underwent IMRT. Although some hospitals where IMRT was performed treated many patients with NPC, the proportion of patients with NPC who were treated with IMRT was low., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT has not been widely adopted in Japan for treating NPC. Barriers for adopting its use should be identified to close the gap between the standard and actual medical practice in Japan. Copyright © The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

1831,"Phase III trial of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy with either first- or third-cycle chemotherapy for limited-disease small-cell lung cancer. Background: We compared late thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) with early TRT in the treatment of limited-disease small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). Patients and Methods: Patients with LD-SCLC received four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin every 21 days. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TRT administered concurrently with the first cycle (early TRT) or the third cycle (late TRT) of chemotherapy. The primary end point was complete response rate. Result(s): Two hundred twenty-two patients were randomly assigned. Late TRT was not inferior to early TRT in terms of the complete response rate (early versus late; 36.0% versus 38.0%). Other efficacy measures including overall survival [median, 24.1 versus 26.8 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.90; 95% CI 0.18-1.62] and progression-free survival (median, 12.4 versus 11.2 months; HR 1.10; 95% CI 0.37-1.84) were not different between two arms. No statistical difference was noted in the pattern of treatment failures. However, neutropenic fever occurred more commonly in the early TRT arm than the late TRT arm (21.6% versus 10.2%; P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): In LD-SCLC treatment, TRT starting in the third cycle of chemotherapy seemed to be noninferior to early TRT, and had a more favorable profile with regard to neutropenic fever. © The Author 2013.

3426,"Tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the result of tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle. METHOD(S): From 1994 to 2000, 3 patients (1 with clavicle osteosynthesis, 1 with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis, and 1 with radioactive ulcer in clavicular region accompanied by chronic osteomyelitis of clavicle) were reconstructed with turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris, and myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal respectively. The outcome was observed. The operation principles of tissue flaps transferring for wound repair of the clavicle were summarized. RESULT(S): Follow-ups were done for 2 months to 7 years. All tissue flaps survived well and the wounds in clavicular region were healed well. There was no recurrence of chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION(S): Turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are often used for wound repair of the clavicle. Most of the wounds of the clavicle can be repaired by turnover adipofascial flap. Myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are more suitable for wound repair with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. In the case of radioactive ulcer of the clavicular region, myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal transposition is a better alternative for wound repair.",Excluded
780,"Investigation of awareness levels about the radiation safety of personnel working in the imaging units of the hospitals in Agri, Turkey. Radiation treatments, which are frequent and hidden hazards in imaging centers in hospitals, seriously affect employee health. In general, people think that there will be nothing to them because they do not know the damage of the radiation. It is not possible to stay away from radiation in some professions. For example, the radiology officials, their job is to identify the disease in people with radiographic method has no chance of dealing with radiation. That's why we need to do our job by getting enough information about radiation and its hazards, and by protecting ourselves and our environment from the dangers of radiation. Therefore, our study aimed to determine the level of information about employee safety of the health personnel working in public and private hospitals in Agri city centrum. Data was collected through a questionnaire by answering the questions of the personnel under observation in the imaging centers of hospitals. All official permits required for our work have been obtained from the necessary authorities. Results showed the inadequacy of knowledge related to ionizing radiation of the personnel, and the necessity of the implementation of radiological examinations by planning training for the safe use.Copyright © 2017 The Egyptian Society of Radiation Sciences and Applications",Excluded

1940,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity. To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded
1072,"Cerebral computed tomographic angiography using third-generation reconstruction algorithm provides improved image quality with lower contrast and radiation dose. PURPOSE: We hypothesized that cerebral CT angiogram performed using third-generation reconstruction algorithm and lower contrast dose-low-kVp technique (LD-CTA) will provide better image quality when compared with regular contrast dose CTA at 120 kVp using a sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithm (ND-CTA)., METHODS: Retrospective imaging review of 100 consecutive patients (50 each in LD- and ND-CTA groups). Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values., RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers. LD-CTA group also used lower contrast (49 cc versus 97 cc in ND-CTA) and had lower radiation exposure (DLP/CTDI for both groups 268.3/80.7 vs 519.5/36.08, both < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Next-generation reconstruction algorithm and low-kV scanning significantly improved image quality on cerebral CTA images despite lower contrast dose and, in addition, have lower radiation exposure.",Excluded
2125,"Three-stage Gamma Knife treatment for metastatic brain tumors larger than 10 cm3: A 2-institute study including re-analyses of earlier results using competing risk analysis. OBJECTIVE The results of 3-stage Gamma Knife treatment (3-st-GK-Tx) for relatively large brain metastases have previously been reported for a series of patients in Chiba, Japan (referred to in this study as the C-series). In the current study, the authors reappraised, using a competing risk analysis, the efficacy and safety of 3-st-GK-Tx by comparing their experience with that of the C-series. METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study. Among 1767 patients undergoing GK radiosurgery for brain metastases at Mito Gamma House during the 2005-2015 period, 78 (34 female, 44 male; mean age 65 years, range 35-86 years) whose largest tumor was > 10 cm3, treated with 3-st-GK-Tx, were studied (referred to in this study as the M-series). The target volumes were covered with a 50% isodose gradient and irradiated with a peripheral dose of 10 Gy at each procedure. The interval between procedures was 2 weeks. Because competing risk analysis had not been employed in the published C-series, the authors reanalyzed the previously published data using this method. RESULTS The overall median survival time after 3-st-GK-Tx was 8.3 months (95% CI 5.6-12.0 months) in the M-series and 8.6 months (95% CI 5.5-10.6 months) in the C-series (p = 0.41). Actuarial survival rates at the 6th and 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx months were, respectively, 55.1% and 35.2% in the M-series and 62.5% and 26.4% in the C-series (HR 1.175, 95% CI 0.790-1.728, p = 0.42). Cumulative incidences at the 12th post-3-st-GK-Tx, determined by competing risk analyses, of neurological deterioration (14.2% in C-series vs 12.8% in M-series), neurological death (7.2% vs 7.7%), local recurrence (4.8% vs 6.2%), repeat SRS (25.9% vs 18.0%), and SRS-related complications (2.3% vs 5.1%) did not differ significantly between the 2 series. CONCLUSIONS There were no significant differences in post-3-st-GK-Tx results between the 2 series in terms of overall survival times, neurological death, maintained neurological status, local control, repeat SRS, and SRS-related complications. The previously published results (C-series) are considered to be validated by the M-series results.Copyright ©AANS 2018.",Excluded
128,"Real-time cerebral angiography: Sensitivity of a new contrast-specific ultrasound technique. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To test a new contrast-specific sonography imaging method that offers visualization of the intracranial vasculature in a manner similar to that seen on angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients (35 sonography studies total) were included in the study after they provided written informed consent. The patients were scanned through the temporal bone window from both sides after intravenous injection of an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA; perflexane lipid microspheres [Imagent]). The goal was to visualize the intracranial arteries, including the middle (M1-M3), anterior (A1 and A2), and posterior (P1-P3) cerebral arteries, using an axial scanning plane. The studies were performed using a contrast-specific imaging mode, based on a phase inversion technique (transcranial ultrasound angiography [tUSA]). For sensitivity, the results were compared with x-ray angiography as the ""gold standard."" For interobserver reliability, 24 of 35 sonography studies were evaluated by 2 physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and by a seasoned sonographer. RESULT(S): The sensitivity of tUSA ranged between 0.778 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.577-0.914) and 0.963 (95% CI of 0.810-0.999). The sensitivities were similar among physicians with little training in transcranial sonography and the seasoned sonographer, indicating high inter-rater reliability. Overall, tUSA provided high anatomic resolution and vascular delineation even of small vessels in the millimeter range. At peak intensity, no UCA-related artifacts were observed. CONCLUSION(S): tUSA provides images of the intracranial arteries similar to those obtained at angiography with high anatomic resolution, reasonable sensitivity, and interobserver reliability.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Is the image quality of thoracic radiographs of cats obtained with a needle-based storage phosphor (NIP) system superior to conventional (PIP) storage phosphor radiography? Is it possible to decrease the mAs by 50 % with the NIP system without significant loss of information?, MATERIALS AND METHODS: From each of the 20 animals, three lateral radiographs were acquired. The assessment of the exposure level was based on the generated lgM-values. Images were acquired 1. with the NIP system and exposure settings equivalent to an lgM of 1.9, 2. with the PIP system and identical settings, and 3. with the NIP system and 50 % of the mAs. Six blinded readers used a 5-step scale to assess the reproducibility of five anatomical structures and image noise sensation. Data were analysed using Visual Grading Characteristics Analysis (VGC)., RESULTS: While applying identical exposure values the NIP system for all features revealed superior ratings to those of the PIP system (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.81 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.92 for ""trachea""). Even when reducing mAs by 50 % in the NIP images all features were rated better compared with the PIP images and original settings (AUC (VGC) values ranged from 0.60 for ""cardiac silhouette"" to 0.74 for ""trachea"" and ""caudal thoracic field"")., CONCLUSION: The NIP system demonstrates clearly better image quality compared to the reference PIP system. A dose reduction of 50 % seems to be possible without relevant detraction from image quality. The results obtained in the animal model are valid for simulating conditions in neonatal radiological practise.",Excluded

Background/Aim: Tumoral calcification after chemotherapy or radiation therapy has been reported in various cancer patients, but not after radioembolization. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of radioembolization-induced tumor calcification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by radioembolization. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study comprised patients with single nodular HCC who underwent yttrium-90 radioembolization between November 2015 and April 2019. The presence of tumoral calcification was visually assessed on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. Result(s): Fiftyfive patients (64.8+/-11.8 years, 43 men) were evaluated. Tumoral calcification was present in 21 (38.2%) of 55 patients in the one-month CT scan (calcification group). The complete response rate for the primary index tumor was 72.7% (40 of 55) in the total study population, and 100% (21 of 21) in the calcification group, respectively. The calcification group had a longer local progression-free survival rate than the noncalcification group (p=0.017). Conclusion(s): Radioembolizationinduced tumoral calcification is relatively common and can be used as an early surrogate marker of complete response.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

PURPOSE: To determine the influence of concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin on parotid gland tissue complication probability., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with either radiotherapy (n = 61) or concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin (n = 36) for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively evaluated. The dose and volume distributions of the parotid glands were noted in dose-volume histograms. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before, during the 2(nd) and 6(th) weeks and at 4 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. The data were fit using the normal tissue complication probability model of Lyman. Complication was defined as a reduction of the salivary flow rate to less than 25% of the pretreatment flow rate., RESULTS: The normal tissue complication probability model parameter TD(50) (the dose leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 32.2 Gy at 4 weeks and 32.1 Gy at 6 months for concomitant radiochemotherapy and 41.1 Gy at 4 weeks and 39.6 Gy at 6 months for radiotherapy. The tolerated dose for concomitant radiochemotherapy was at least 7 to 8 Gy lower than for radiotherapy alone at TD(50)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concomitant radiochemotherapy tended to cause a higher probability of parotid gland tissue damage. Advanced radiotherapy planning approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be particularly important for parotid sparing in radiochemotherapy because of cisplatin-related increased radiosensitivity of glands.",Excluded
1986,"Utilization of chest CT for injured patients during visits to U.S. emergency departments: 2012-2015. Introduction: Increased use of computed tomography (CT) during injury-related Emergency Department (ED) visits has been reported, despite increased awareness of CT radiation exposure risks. We investigated national trends in the use of chest CT during injury-related ED visits between 2012 and 2015. Method(s): Analyzing injury-related ED visits from the 2012-2015 United States (U.S.) National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), we determined the percentage of visits that had a chest CT and the diagnostic yield of these chest CTs for clinically-significant findings. We used survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression to determine which patient and visit characteristics were associated with chest CT use. Result(s): Injury-related visits accounted for 30% of the 135 million yearly ED visits represented in NHAMCS. Of these visits, 817,480 (2%) received a chest CT over the study period. The diagnostic yield was 3.88%. Chest CT utilization did not change significantly from a rate of 1.73% in 2012 to a rate of 2.31% in 2015 (p = 0.14). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated increased odds of chest CT for patients seen by residents versus by attendings (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-3.08). Patients aged 18-59 and 60+ had higher AORs (5.75, CI 3.44-9.61 and 9.81, CI 5.90-16.33, respectively) than those <18 years of receiving chest CT.

1277,"Comparison of 51chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and iohexol as blood markers for intestinal permeability testing in Beagle dogs. (51)Chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) is the gold standard probe for assessing intestinal permeability (IP) in dogs, but exposure to radioactivity is a disadvantage. Iohexol is a safe contrast medium commonly used for medical imaging purposes and has been successfully applied more recently for the assessment of IP in animal models and humans. This study aimed at comparing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol as IP blood markers in dogs. A test solution containing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol was administered intragastrically to seven healthy laboratory Beagle dogs, and percentage recoveries in serum were calculated. The strong linear association (correlation, r=0.76 and linear regression, y=0.03+5.04x) between (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol supports the potential usefulness of iohexol as an IP blood marker in dogs.

838,"Impact of radiotherapy dose on dentition breakdown in head and neck cancer patients. Purpose: To evaluate the severity of post-radiation dental lesions and possible correlation with radiation dose to the teeth in patients treated for head and neck cancers. Methods and Materials: Data from 93 head and neck radiotherapy patients treated between 1997 and 2008 were analyzed retrospectively. The main effect, radiation dose to the individual teeth, was evaluated with covariates of elapsed time after radiation, xerostomia, topical fluoride use, and oral hygiene status included. Patients' radiotherapy plans were used to calculate cumulative exposure for each tooth. Patients' teeth were evaluated using a validated index and then categorized as having none-slight or moderate-severe post-radiation damage. Result(s): Patients (31 females, 62 males) ranged in age from 18-82 years (mean 57). The number of teeth-patient ranged from 3-30 (mean 20) with a total of 1873 teeth evaluated. Overall, 51% of teeth had moderate-severe damage, with the remaining having little or none. Using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, the odds for moderate-severe damage were 2-3 times greater for teeth exposed to between 30 and 60 Gy as compared to no radiation. However, for teeth exposed to >= 60 Gy as compared to no radiation the odds of moderate-severe tooth damage was greater by a magnitude of 10 times. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that there is minimal tooth damage below 30 Gy (salivary gland threshold), a greater than 1:1 increased dose-response between 30 and 60 Gy likely related to salivary gland damage, and a critical threshold of >= 60 Gy, which may be linked to direct effects of radiation on tooth structure. These findings suggest that care should be taken during the treatment planning process to limit tooth dose, and when clinically possible to limit tooth dose to less than 60 Gy. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded

Early identification of these high-risk patients could improve treatment and reduce mortality. Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) has previously been associated with CAD in autopsy studies. Since the AAC can be quantified easily using a lateral lumbar X-ray we hypothesized that the extent of AAC as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray might be predictive of the presence of significant CAD in dialysis patients. Method(s): All patients currently enrolled in the ICD2 trial without a history of CABG or a PCI with stent implantation were included in this study. All patients underwent CT-angiography (CTA) and a lateral X-ray of the abdomen. AAC on X-ray was quantified using a previously validated scoring system whereupon the association between AAC and the presence of significant CAD was assessed. Result(s): A total of 90 patients were included in this study (71% male, 67 +/- 7 years old). Forty-six patients were found to have significant CAD. AAC-score was significantly higher in patients with CAD (10.1 +/- 4.9 vs 6.3 +/- 4.6 (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that AAC score is an independent predictor for the presence of CAD with a 1,2 fold higher risk per point increase (p < 0.01). The AAC score has a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 57% for the presence of significant CAD. Conclusion(s): This study shows that abdominal aortic calcification as assessed on a lateral lumbar X-ray is predictive for the presence of significant coronary artery disease in asymptomatic dialysis patients. This simple, non-invasive and cheap screening method could contribute to early identification of patients eligible for further screening of CAD.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).",Excluded
229,"The role of cross-cultural factors in long-duration international space missions: lessons from the SFINCSS-99 study. UNLABELLED: The role of cross-cultural factors in long-duration international space missions was examined during an isolation study that simulated many of the conditions aboard the International Space Station., METHODS: Interactions involving two heterogeneous crews and one homogeneous crew staying in isolation from 110 to 240 days were studied. Data consisted of post-isolation interviews with crewmembers, ground support personnel and management, observational data, and public statements by crewmembers. Data was analyzed using the techniques of linguistic anthropology and ethnography., RESULTS: Sub-cultural (organizational and professional) differences played a larger role than national differences in causing misunderstandings in this study. Conversely, some misunderstandings and conflicts were escalated by participants falsely assuming cultural differences or similarities. Comparison between the two heterogeneous crews showed the importance of training, personality factors, and commander and language skills in preventing and alleviating cultural misunderstandings., CONCLUSION: The study revealed a number of ways that cultural differences, real as well as assumed, can play a role and interact with other, non-cultural, factors in causing and/or precipitating conflict situations. It is postulated that such difficulties can be avoided by selecting culturally adaptive crewmembers and by cross-cultural and language training. Also the crew composition and role of commander were found to be important in mitigating conflict situations. Copyright c2002 Lister Science.",Excluded
190,"Radiation exposure to the surgeon during open lumbar microdiscectomy and minimally invasive microdiscectomy: A prospective, controlled trial. Study Design.: This is a prospective in vivo study comparing radiation exposure to the surgeon during 10 minimally invasive lumbar microdiscectomy cases with 10 traditional open discectomy cases as a control. Objective.: Radiation exposure to the eye, chest, and hand of the operating surgeon during minimally invasive surgery (MIS) and open lumbar microdiscectomy were measured. The Occupational Exposure Guidelines were used to calculate the allowable number of cases per year from the mean values at each of the 3 sites. Summary of Background Data.: Fluoroscopy is a source of ionizing radiation and as such, is a potential health hazard with continued exposure during surgery. Presently, radiation exposure to the surgeon during MIS lumbar microdiscectomy is unknown. Methods.: Radiation exposure to the surgeon (millirads [mR]) per case was measured by digital dosimeters placed at the level of the thyroid/eye, chest, and dominant forearm. Other data collected included operative side and level, side of the surgeon, side of the x-ray source, total fluoroscopy time, and energy output. Results.: The average radiation exposure to the surgeon during open cases was thyroid/eye 0.16 +/- 0.22 mR, chest 0.21 +/- 0.23 mR, and hand 0.20 +/- 0.14 mR. During minimally invasive cases exposure to the thyroid/eye was 1.72 +/- 1.52 mR, the chest was 3.08 +/- 2.93 mR, and the hand was 4.45 +/- 3.75 mR. The difference between thyroid/ eye, chest, and hand exposure during open and minimally invasive cases was statistically significant (P = 0.010, P = 0.013, and P = 0.006, respectively). Surgeons standing in an adjacent substerile room during open cases were exposed to 0.2 mR per case. Conclusion.: MIS lumbar microdiscectomy cases expose the surgeon to significantly more radiation than open microdiscectomy. One would need to perform 1623 MIS microdiscectomies to exceed the exposure limit for whole-body radiation, 8720 cases for the lens of the eye, and 11,235 cases for the hand. Standing in a substerile room during x-ray localization in open cases is not fully protective. Copyright © 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

2205,"[Osteoradionecrosis in adults]. Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is not exceptional, despite advances in irradiation techniques. Six cases are reported, involving the pelvis, coxofemoral joint, mandible and vertebrae; in this last case, the semiologic value of the lucent intrasomatic image seen on plain films and tomographies of the vertebrae is underscored. The irradiation dose (above 3 000 rad) is the chief factor in osteoradionecrosis, which may be precipitated by adjuvant factors and potentiating events such as trauma and infection. Pathologic study shows several lesions whose association is suggestive: cell lesions, osteoporosis, vascular lesions, and foci of necrosis. The pathogenic significance of lesions of bone cells is demonstrated, while the part played by vascular lesions is controversial. Involvement of the pelvis and hips following irradiation of pelvic carcinoma is the most common. The scapular girdle and ribs may be involved in irradiation for breast cancer. In involvement of the mandible, remarkable features are its frequency following irradiation of carcinoma of the mouth, the significant part played by potentiating factors, i.e. infection and trauma, severity of complications, i.e. fistulae and hemorrhage, and lastly difficulties of management. Among infrequent sites, involvement of the vertebrae is of interest as it may mimic collapse due to osteoporosis or metastasis. Diagnosis rests on an association of criteria, and fortunately bone biopsy is usually unnecessary. The clinical features, topographical characteristics and course of the disease allow differentiation from bone metastasis; it may be more difficult to distinguish postirradiation sarcoma, which is exceptional, or a number of benign conditions, such as aseptic necrosis, infectious osteoarthritis, and destructive coxarthrosis.",Excluded
3103,"Arthroscopic removal of arch-shaped rotator cuff calcifying tendinitis without rotator cuff repair and acromioplasty is an excellent treatment regarding pain relief and function. Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcome for arthroscopic removal of calcium deposit without acromioplasty and rotator cuff repair for patients with ultrasound-diagnosed arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis of the rotator cuff (type I), homogenic (x-ray) with chronic pain. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 50 patients with homogenous, arch-shaped calcifying tendinitis, suffering from chronic pain and who underwent arthroscopic treatment and 50 patients with the same type of tendinitis treated conservatively. All patients had calcium deposit located in supraspinatus tendon, pre-operatively and post-operatively evaluated by ultrasound. Clinical outcome was assessed by using Quick DASH, UCLA, and VAS score. Result(s): There were 29 male and 71 female patients; none had bilateral involvement. We divided patients into group A-operatively treated-and group B-conservatively treated-by shock wave therapy. Patients from group A had higher improvement of all used tests, QDash (from 19.3 to 2.7), UCLA (from 10 to 34), and VAS score (from 3 to 0) when compared with group B. Conclusion(s): Patients with arch-shaped calcium deposits and acoustic shadow have better results after arthroscopic treatment than the conservative one. There was no need for acromioplasty or tendon repair. The lack of performing the same did not have any impact on the post-operative rehabilitation and recovery.Copyright © 2021, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded
1999,"Epidemiology of lung cancer in women: A hospital-based descriptive study. Objective: Lung cancer required much greater attention as it is the most common cause of death. According to statistics in 2010, 85% of lung cancer in men and 57% in women are attributed to tobacco smoking. The aim of the study was to describe the clinical and pathologic characteristics of the female patients who visited the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital between 2009 and 2017. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinicopathologic data collected for analyses included age at diagnosis, history of cigarette use, comorbid conditions, family history, tumor-node-metastasis stage, pathologic subtypes of lung carcinoma, and the given therapy. From July 2017 to February 2018, we collected data of 540 female patients with lung cancer at the Department of Medical Oncology of Acibadem Maslak Hospital. Result(s): Among 540 patients, 185 patients (34.3%) were nonsmokers, 106 (19.6%) were current smokers, and 210 (38.9%) were former smokers. Data on common comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were collected, and the conditions were classified according to the smoking status of the patients. Among current and former smokers, 36.7% were diagnosed with hypertension, 18.3% with diabetes mellitus, and 11% with coronary artery diseases. Moreover, 75% of all patients were diagnosed with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whereas 16% were diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histological type of cancer seen in patients with NSCLC (77%), followed by patients with squamous cell carcinoma (15%). Conclusion(s): Factors other than tobacco use, such as radon exposure, air pollution, radiation exposure, and an unbalanced diet are responsible for the increasing incidence of lung cancer. However, further studies are warranted to investigate the cause of the epidemic differences in women, particularly the gender bias in nonsmoker patients with lung cancer.Copyright © 2020 by Turkish Society of Medical Oncology.",Excluded
2490,"Hippocampal sparing radiotherapy for glioblastoma patients: A planning study using volumetric modulated arc therapy. Background: The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential to reduce exposure of the contralateral hippocampus in radiotherapy for glioblastoma using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Method(s): Datasets of 27 patients who had received 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) for glioblastoma with a prescribed dose of 60Gy in fractions of 2Gy were included in this planning study. VMAT plans were optimized with the aim to reduce the dose to the contralateral hippocampus as much as possible without compromising other parameters. Hippocampal dose and treatment parameters were compared to the 3D-CRT plans using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The influence of tumour location and PTV size on the hippocampal dose was investigated with the Mann-Whitney-U-test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Result(s): The median reduction of the contralateral hippocampus generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) with VMAT was 36 % compared to the original 3D-CRT plans (p<0.05). Other dose parameters were maintained or improved. The median V30Gy brain could be reduced by 17.9 % (p<0.05). For VMAT, a parietal and a non-temporal tumour localisation as well as a larger PTV size were predictors for a higher hippocampal dose (p<0.05). Conclusion(s): Using VMAT, a substantial reduction of the radiotherapy dose to the contralateral hippocampus for patients with glioblastoma is feasible without compromising other treatment parameters. For larger PTV sizes, less sparing can be achieved. Whether this approach is able to preserve the neurocognitive status without compromising the oncological outcome needs to be investigated in the setting of prospective clinical trials.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).",Excluded
627,"Preclinical evaluation of dual-energy imaging for lung tumor image guided radiotherapy. Purpose/Objective(s): Dual energy (DE) imaging is routinely used in diagnostic radiology to produce tissue-selective x-ray images. DE imaging uses two different energies, such as 120kVp and 60 kVp. By performing a weighted subtraction of the logarithm of these images, subtraction images can be created to enhance either soft tissue or bone. In the lung, DE imaging can be used to eliminate overlying bony anatomy to improve tumor visualization. The goal of this study was to evaluate the theoretical potential of DE imaging to improve localization of lung tumors in patients undergoing image guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Materials/Methods: Free-breathing planning CT scans of 20 patients with stage IA or IB NSCLC were evaluated for this study. Software was written to convert the Hounsfield units (HU) of the CT scans into attenuation coefficients for 60kV and 120 kV x-rays. Subsequently, digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were generated for each of these energies.Weighted subtraction was performed to create tissue selective subtraction images that highlight soft tissue. These soft tissue images were compared with the standard DRRs to evaluate tumor contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CNR represents the difference between the tumor signal and the background, divided by the standard deviation (noise) of these regions. Thus, CNR provides a quantitative measure of tumor visibility. Result(s): Qualitatively, DE subtraction resulted in the complete disappearance of bone and provided improved visualization of lung tumors on anterior-posterior DE-DRRs relative to standard DRRs. The average CNR for DE-DRRs was 5.74 +/- 1.85 vs 3.99 +/- 2.04 for standard DRRs, p<0.01. This represents an improvement of 44% in the CNR when using DE-DRRs. Of interest, the presence of breast tissue in female patients resulted in lower CNRs for both standard and DE-DRRs. In females (7 patients) the average CNR was 5.05 +/- 1.82 for DE-DRRs and 3.35 +/- 1.19 for standard DRRs, compared to 6.11 +/- 1.83 and 4.33 +/- 2.35 in males (13 patients), respectively. Despite the lower CNRs in female patients, the DE-DRRs represented an improvement of 51% over standard DRRs, which is comparable to the improvement in males of 41%. Conclusion(s): DE subtraction chest imaging that enhances soft tissue may improve target localization in lung cancer patients receiving kV-based IGRT planar imaging.We believe that this approach could improve daily localization as well as be used as part of an adaptive radiotherapy program. We are further investigating the use of DE subtraction imaging in this setting including an analysis of image acquisition dose to the patients.

1621,"Induction of complete wound healing in recalcitrant ulcers by low-intensity laser irradiation depends on ulcer cause and size. Chronic skin ulcers still represent a therapeutic challenge in dermatology. Among the various non-invasive treatment modalities used for the improvement of impaired wound healing, low-intensity laser irradiations are gaining an increasing body of interest. We used low-intensity laser irradiations delivered by a 30 mW helium-neon laser at an energy density of 30 J/cm2 three times weekly for the induction of wound healing in ulcers of diverse causes. Twenty patients with the same number of ulcers, which had previously been treated by conventional wound care for a median period of 34 weeks (range: 3-120 weeks) without any significant evidence of healing, were included in the study. Concerning the underlying disorders, patients were divided into four groups: diabetes, arterial insufficiency, radio damage and autoimmune vasculitis. In all ulcers, complete epithelization could be induced by laser therapy. No amputation or any other surgical intervention was necessary and no adverse effects of any kind were noted during low-intensity laser treatment. Regarding the different diagnoses, a statistically significant difference was noted (P = 0.008): ulcers due to radio damage healed significantly faster than those caused by diabetes (6 weeks [range: 3-10 weeks] vs. 16 weeks [range: 9-45 weeks], P = 0.005). Wound healing in autoimmune vasculitis (24 weeks [range: 20-35 weeks]) required longer than in radiodermitis, although the difference was not significant. In addition to the diagnosis, wound size was found to be an important factor influencing the duration of wound closure (P = 0.028), whereas duration of previous conventional treatment (P = 0.24) and depth (P = 0.14) showed no effect. Our results indicate that low-intensity laser irradiation could be a valuable non-invasive tool for the induction of wound healing in recalcitrant ulcers, and that healing time is correlated with the ulcer cause and size.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency and cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation are common approaches for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation treatment, showing similar results in recent multicenter studies, including heterogeneous tools and protocols. The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety. Cryoablation requires longer fluoroscopy exposure compared with radiofrequency, although this is reduced by increased experience.",Excluded

Purpose: The treatment of wound healing disturbances of the radial forearm free flap donor site after reconstructive surgery is typically long and burdensome and often requires additional surgery. Cold atmospheric plasma is a promising approach to overcome these impairments. The aim of this proof of concept study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of plasma irradiation in patients with wound healing disorders with exposed brachial tendons of the radial forearm. Patients and Methods: Four patients (mean age 64.2 years, range 44 to 80) who had undergone radial forearm free flap procedures and developed wound healing disturbance leading to exposed flexor tendons were included in the present prospective case series. In addition to routine wound care, all sites were irradiated with cold atmospheric plasma. The primary outcome variable was complete wound closure. Result(s): In all patients, complete wound repair in terms of the absence of tendon exposure was observed within a mean treatment time of 10.1 weeks (range 4.9 to 16). No undesirable side effects were observed, and no inflammation or infection occurred. Conclusion(s): Cold atmospheric plasma could offer a reliable conservative treatment option for complicated wound healing disturbances. This was exemplarily shown in the case of radial forearm free flap donor site morbidity with exposed flexor tendons in the present study.Copyright © 2016 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded

This clinical study was done in fifty-one cases of non-healing ulcers of more than six weeks duration to evaluate the efficacy of Nimba taila (Neem oil) externally and Manjistha churna (powder) orally as well as its kwatha externally with an aim to provide an effective management in cases of non healing ulcers. For assessment, wound measurement was done before, during and after treatment and wound healing time as well as lab tests like swab culture, X-ray of affected part, Hemoglobin, Total Leucocytes Count, Differential Leucocytes Count, Liver Function Test, blood sugar level and HbA1c were recorded. Patients with tubercular, malignant ulcers and with ulcers of less than 6 weeks duration were excluded from the study. In the patients treated with only Nimba taila, 31.2% (5/16) patients had 50% healing at eight weeks therapy while with only Manjistha churna, 20.0% (3/15) patients had 50% healing at eight weeks therapy but in the cases, treated with both the drugs, 75.0% (15/20) patients had achieved 50% healing at eight weeks therapy. The study suggests that there is an added effect (quick healing of wound) of Nimba taila with Manjistha churna & its kwatha in cases of non healing diabetic ulcer and single use of Nimba taila or Manjistha churna is not much significant but it is observed keenly that use of Nimba taila alone is comparatively more beneficial than single use of Manjistha churna.

PURPOSE: CT is a useful modality for the evaluation of fetal skeletal dysplasia but radiation exposure is unavoidable. The purpose of this study is to compare the usefulness of MRI and CT for evaluating the fetal skeletal shape., METHODS: This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Fetal specimens (n = 14) were scanned on a 3T MRI scanner using our newly-developed sequence. It is based on T2*-weighted imaging (TR, 12 ms; TE for opposed-phase imaging, 6.1 ms, for in-phase imaging, 7.3 ms; flip angle, 40degree). The specimens were also scanned on a 320 detector-row CT scanner.

The purpose of this study was to compare opacification of the urinary collecting system and radiation dose associated with three-phase 64-MDCT urographic protocols and those associated with a split-bolus dual-phase protocol including furosemide. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Images from 150 CT urographic examinations performed with three scanning protocols were retrospectively evaluated. Group A consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a three-phase protocol with saline infusion. Group B consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a reduced-radiation three-phase protocol with saline. Group C consisted of 50 sequentially registered patients who underwent a dual-phase split-bolus protocol that included a low-dose furosemide injection. Opacification of the urinary collecting system was evaluated with segmental binary scoring. Contrast artifacts were evaluated, and radiation doses were recorded. Results were compared by analysis of variance. RESULTS. A significant reduction in mean effective radiation dose was found between groups A and B (p < 0.001) and between groups B and C (p < 0.001), resulting in 65% reduction between groups A and C (p < 0.001). This reduction did not significantly affect opacification score in any of the 12 urinary segments (p = 0.079). In addition, dense contrast artifacts overlying the renal parenchyma observed with the three-phase protocols (groups A and B) were avoided with the dual-phase protocol (group C) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. A dual-phase protocol with furosemide injection is the preferable technique for CT urography. In comparison with commonly used three-phase protocols, the dualphase protocol significantly reduces radiation exposure dose without reduction in image quality. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

The primary endpoint was the response rate. Secondary objectives were toxicity, time to progression, and overall survival. Forty-four patients were included and 40 were eligible. The mean age was 60.5 years (range 40.7-72.1), and 75% had stage IIIB disease. Six patients underwent complete R0 resection including 2 pathologic complete responses after a planned intermediate evaluation. Thirty-three patients completed CHRT. The objective response rate was 65% (95% CI 50.2-79.8). Grade 3-4 hematologic and digestive toxicities were observed mainly during the induction phase.

2784,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants. An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly.

1023,"Cognitive impairment following radiation to hippocampus and other brain structures in adults with primary brain tumours. Background: Radiation therapy (RT) to the brain may result in cognitive impairment. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the relationship between RT dose to the hippocampus and learning and memory functions. Secondary objective was to examine relationships between doses to other brain structures and specific cognitive functions. Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken in 78 primary brain tumour patients after RT. Cognitive function was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Test scores were standardized using normative data adjusted for age and level of education. Test-specific cognitive impairment was determined as a z-score <=-1.5. Radiation dose to brain structures and test-specific cognitive impairment outcomes were fitted to a logistic regression model. Result(s): High RT dose to the left hippocampus was associated with impaired verbal learning and memory (p = 0.04). RT dose to the left hippocampus, left temporal lobe, left frontal lobe and total frontal lobe were associated with verbal fluency impairment (p < 0.05) and doses to the thalamus and the left frontal lobe with impaired executive functioning (p <= 0.03). Finally, RT dose to the brain and thalamus were associated with impaired processing speed (p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): The present study indicates that the hippocampus may be vulnerable to radiation and that high radiation doses to the left hippocampus may lead to significant verbal learning and memory impairment. High RT doses to the left hippocampus and other left side structures may result in impairments in verbal fluency, executive function, and processing speed. Validation of these findings are being undertaken in a prospective study.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose. Although a small volume high dose area within the normal structure could be observed in several patients, results of the present study showed potential benefits of the CyberKnife SRT boost.",Excluded
254,"Lack of effect of the MR (mutator) factor on the maternal repair system in Drosophila melanogaster. Experiments were designed to test whether the functioning of the maternal repair system will be different in females heterozygous for MR (male recombination factor) relative to that in females not carrying the MR. Muller-5 males were irradiated and mated to either MR/ + or Cy/ + females, and the frequencies of sex-linked recessive lethals in mature spermatozoa were determined and compared. The frequencies were similar with both types of female, demonstrating that heterozygosity for MR does not lead to an alteration in the functioning of the maternal repair system.",Excluded
1205,"Pleomorphic adenomas: post-operative radiotherapy is unnecessary following primary incomplete excision: a retrospective review. BACKGROUND: Current standard treatment of Pleomorphic Salivary Adenoma (PSA) of the Parotid Gland is by surgical excision. The management of incomplete excision remains undecided with post-operative radiotherapy advocated by some and observation by others., METHODS: 190 patients who underwent resection of PSA of the parotid gland within the West of Scotland region from 1981 to 2008 were identified and data collected., RESULTS: 78/190 patients had a primary incomplete excision. 25/78 received post-operative radiotherapy and 53 were observed. Recurrences occurred in 11/53 in those observed and in 1/25 of those who received radiotherapy. 21/25 complained of significant side effects from the radiotherapy. 38 surgeons performed 190 procedures, with a range of experience from 1 to28 procedures., CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy does appear to reduce recurrence with incomplete excision, however it is associated with significant side effects. We therefore feel radiotherapy should not be routinely recommended. Subspecialisation should be adopted to increase the operating surgeon's experience.

215,"Involved-site radiotherapy for helicobacter pylori-independent gastric MALT lymphoma: 26 years of experience with 178 patients. Treatment options for Helicobacter pylori-independent gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (GML) include surgery, immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (RT). The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RT and routine endoscopic surveillance, hypothesizing that most patients are curable with RT alone. We queried a single institution database at a tertiary referral cancer center for patients with H pylori-independent GML treated with RT between 1991 and 2017. Response was assessed by follow-up endoscopies (EGDs) starting 10 to 12 weeks post-RT. Computed tomography scans were also part of the follow-up program, and positron emission tomography was added when clinically appropriate. We identified 178 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 25-89 years); 86% had stage I disease, 7% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage IV disease. Median RT dose was 3000 cGy over 20 fractions. Ninety-five percent of patients exhibited complete pathologic response on posttreatment EGD. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients experienced in-field secondary malignancies. Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 9.6% experienced local failures, and 11.8% developed distant sites of disease. Five-year and 10-year overall survival were 94% and 79%, respectively, from last date of RT. RT is a highly effective and safe treatment for GML with excellent overall survival and very rare acute or late treatment-related toxicities. Favorable outcomes from this large retrospective sample of patients provide credible and compelling support for RT as standard of care for H pylori-independent GML.Copyright © 2021 by The American Society of Hematology",Excluded
3299,"Bone marrow-derived cells rescue salivary gland function in mice with head and neck irradiation. Treatment for most patients with head and neck cancers includes ionizing radiation. A consequence of this treatment is irreversible damage to salivary glands (SGs), which is accompanied by a loss of fluid-secreting acinar-cells and a considerable decrease of saliva output. While there are currently no adequate conventional treatments for this condition, cell-based therapies are receiving increasing attention to regenerate SGs. In this study, we investigated whether bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) can differentiate into salivary epithelial cells and restore SG function in head and neck irradiated mice. BMDCs from male mice were transplanted into the tail-vein of 18 Gy-irradiated female mice. Salivary output was increased in mice that received BMDCs transplantation at week 8 and 24 post-irradiation. At 24 weeks after irradiation (IR), harvested SGs (submandibular and parotid glands) of BMDC-treated mice had greater weights than those of non-treated mice. Histological analysis shows that SGs of treated mice demonstrated an increased level of tissue regenerative activity such as blood vessel formation and cell proliferation, while apoptotic activity was increased in non-transplanted mice. The expression of stem cell markers (Sca-1 or c-kit) was detected in BMDC-treated SGs. Finally, we detected an increased ratio of acinar-cell area and approximately 9% of Y-chromosome-positive (donor-derived) salivary epithelial cells in BMDC-treated mice. We propose here that cell therapy using BMDCs can rescue the functional damage of irradiated SGs by direct differentiation of donor BMDCs into salivary epithelial cells. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

3081,"Measuring and Monitoring Skeletal Muscle Mass after Stroke: A Review of Current Methods and Clinical Applications. Objectives: Muscle mass at admission is important to survive stroke, and stroke-induced sarcopenia is a serious problem because of its poor prognosis. Muscle mass measurement and monitoring are essential for appropriate rehabilitation and nutrition management. However, few reviews are available about the muscle mass measurement and monitoring after stroke. Material(s) and Method(s): Several methods are used to assess skeletal muscle mass in stroke, such as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, bioelectrical impedance analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, biomarkers, and anthropometrics. We summarized the current methods and clinical applications in stroke. Result(s): In stroke, a head CT is used to estimate muscle mass by measuring the temporal muscle. However, it can be conducted retrospectively due to radiation exposure. After stroke, limb muscle atrophy and diaphragm dysfunction are observed using ultrasound. However, ultrasound requires an understanding of the methods and skill. A bioelectrical impedance analysis can be used to assess muscle mass in patients after a stroke unless they have dynamic fluid changes. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry is used for follow-up after hospital discharge. Urinary titin N-fragment and serum C-terminal agrin fragment reflect muscle atrophy after stroke. Anthropometrics may be useful with limited resources. Conclusion(s): We summarized the features of each measurement and proved the recent evidence to properly measure and monitor skeletal muscle mass after stroke.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

We have recently studied the LSP in spatial scattering planes, denoted as the cell's ""3D fingerprint,"" for mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood. The effects of membrane size, morphology, and the existence of the nucleus on the spatial LSP are discussed. In order to distinguish clinical label-free mature and immature lymphocytes, the special features of the spatial LSP are studied by statistical method in both the spatial and frequency domains. Spatial LSP provides rich information on the cell's morphology and contents, which can distinguish mature from immature lymphocyte cells and hence ultimately it may be a useful label-free technique for clinical leukemia diagnosis.",Excluded
3031,"Developmental switch from LTD to LTP in low frequency-induced plasticity. The stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers at low frequency (1 Hz) for 3-5 min can trigger a slow-onset form of low-frequency stimulation (LFS)-long-term potentiation (LTP) (LFS-LTP) in the CA1 area of the adult rat hippocampus. Here we have examined the developmental profile of this plasticity. In 9-15 day-old rats, the application of 1 Hz for 5 min induced long-term depression (LFS-LTD). In 17-21 day-old rats, 1 Hz stimulation had no effect when applied for 5 min but mediated LTD when stimulus duration was increased to 15 min. Over 25 day-old, 1 Hz stimulation mediated LFS-LTP. LFS-LTD was dependent on both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and mGlu5 receptor activation. Antagonists of mGlu1alpha and cannabinoid type 1 receptor were ineffective to block LTD induction. LFS-LTD was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a postsynaptic locus of expression of this plasticity. Next, we examined whether LFS-LTD was related to 'chemical' LTDs obtained by the direct stimulation of mGlu5 and NMDA receptors. The saturation of LFS-LTD completely occluded NMDA- and (RS)-2-Chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG)-induced LTD. CHPG-LTD and NMDA-LTD occluded each other. In addition, we observed that NMDA-LTD was dependent on mGlu5 receptor activation in 9-12 day old rats while it was not in animals older than 15 day-old. Therefore we postulate that during LFS application, NMDA and mGlu5 receptor could interact to trigger LTD. Low-frequency-mediated synaptic plasticity is subject to a developmental switch from NMDA- and mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTD to mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTP with a transient period (17-21 day-old) during which LFS is ineffective.",Excluded
305,"Advanced abdominal imaging with dual energy CT is feasible without increasing radiation dose. BACKGROUND: Dual energy CT (DECT) has proven its potential in oncological imaging. Considering the repeated follow-up examinations, radiation dose should not exceed conventional single energy CT (SECT). Comparison studies on the same scanner with a large number of patients, considering patient geometries and image quality, and exploiting full potential of SECT dose reduction are rare. Purpose of this retrospective study was to compare dose of dual source DECT versus dose-optimized SECT abdominal imaging in clinical routine., METHODS: One hundred patients (62y (+/-14)) had either contrast-enhanced SECT including automatic voltage control (44) or DECT (56). CT dose index (CTDIvol), size-specific dose-estimate (SSDE) and dose-length product (DLP) were reported. Image noise (SD) was recorded as mean of three ROIs placed in subcutaneous fat and normalized to dose by [Formula: see text] . For dose-normalized contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRD), mean attenuation of psoas muscle (CTmuscle) and subcutaneous fat (CTfat) were compared by CNRD = (CTmuscle - CTfat)/SDn. Statistical significance was tested with two-sided t-test (alpha = 0.05)., RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p < 0.05) between DECT and SECT: Mean CTDIvol was 14.2 mGy (+/-3.9) (DECT) and 14.3 mGy (+/-4.5) (SECT). Mean DLP was 680 mGy*cm (+/-220) (DECT) and 665 mGy*cm (+/-231) (SECT). Mean SSDE was 15.7 mGy (+/-1.9) (DECT) and 16.1 mGy (+/-2.5) (SECT). Mean SDn was 42.2 (+/-13.9) HU [Formula: see text] (DECT) and 47.8 (+/-14.9) HU [Formula: see text] (SECT). Mean CNRD was 3.9 (+/-1.3) [Formula: see text].

1538,"Efficacy of narrowband UVB vs. PUVA in patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides. INTRODUCTION: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of the skin that often begins as limited patches and plaques with slow progression to systemic involvement. Narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B therapy has been proven to be an effective short-term treatment modality for clearing patch-stage MF. The effect of psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet A (PUVA) in the treatment of patch- and plaque-type MF has also been thoroughly documented., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of narrowband UVB and PUVA in patients with early-stage MF., METHODS: We analysed the response to treatment, relapse-free survival and irradiation dose in 114 patients with histologically confirmed early-stage MF (stage IA, IB and IIA)., RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were treated with PUVA (83.3%) and 19 with narrowband UVB (16.7%). With PUVA, 59 patients (62.1%) had a complete response (CR), 24 (25.3%) had a partial response (PR) and 12 (12.6%) had a failed response. Narrowband UVB led to CR in 12 (68.4%) patients, PR in 5 (26.3%) patients and a failed response in 1 (5.3%) patient. There were no differences in terms of time to relapse between patients treated with PUVA and those treated with narrowband UVB (11.5 vs. 14.0 months respectively; P = 0.816). No major adverse reactions were attributed to the treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that phototherapy is a safe, effective and well-tolerated, first-line therapy in patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with prolonged disease-free remissions being achieved. It suggests that narrowband UVB is at least as effective as PUVA for treatment of early-stage MF.",Excluded
2318,"Skull-base invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Magnetic resonance imaging findings and therapeutic implications. Purpose: To evaluate the value of skull-base abnormality on MRI for predicting local recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Material(s) and Method(s): Between November 1988 and February 1997, 48 patients with NPC were examined with both MRI (1.5 T) and CT prior to radiation therapy. T classification (1987 UICC) based on physical examination and CT findings were T1 in 3 cases, T2 in 22, T3 in 9, and T4 in 14. On MRI, low-intensity tissue with Gd enhancement in the marrow of the skull was considered to be a suspicious finding of skull-base invasion. CT simulation was performed in all patients. The total dose to the primary tumor was 60-75 Gy (mean, 67 Gy). The mean follow-up period was 42 months. Result(s): All 14 T4 patients had abnormal tissue in the marrow of the skull base on MRI. Thirty-eight percent (13 of 34) of T1-3 patients were suspected to have skull-base invasion based on MRI (0% for T1, 27% [6 of 22] for T2, and 78% [7 of 9] for T3). The 5-year local control rate was significantly different between T1-3 and T4 tumors (97% vs. 69%, p < 0.025) but was not different by the presence of the MRI abnormality in the skull base. Conclusion(s): Skull-base invasion suspected solely by MRI does not relate to local recurrence provided that careful treatment planning is performed with the aid of MRI and CT simulator.

Armitage, Doll (1957) proposed that two homologous chromosomes each contained a region which was critical in the control of cell division. The two steps were mutations in these regions brought about by random exposure to carcinogenic agents. Comings (1973) proposed a similar theory but the two steps were considered to be spontaneous mutatons. This paper points out that if one mutation has occurred this can become dominant in at least six ways which mostly involve chromosome translocations.

2683,"18F-sodium fluoride pet bone scans. Background Information: 18 F-fluoride is a bone seeking positron emitting tracer with high sensitivity and specificity for detection of osseous lesions, and in particular osteolytic lesions. It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging.

870,"A rare complication after shoulder arthroplasty, Radial Nerve Palsy: A case report. INTRODUCTION: Shoulder arthroplasty modernized by Neer and al for proximal humerus fracture has shown excellent outcome.1 Despite its clinical success, complications do occur. Neurological injury is a rare complication with an estimated incidence 1% to 4%.2 Here we would like to report an uncommon complication of radial nerve palsy hence to discuss the possible causes and preventive measures. CASE REPORT: Mr X, a 50 year old gentleman, right hand dominant who works an office clerk, presented with a 4 parts fracture of proximal right humerus with anterior shoulder following a motor-vehicle accident (Figure 1). He underwent a shoulder hemiarthroplasty 2 weeks post-trauma. Procedure was performed under interscalene regional block with a standard delto-pectoral approach. The displaced humeral head button hole into pectoralis major muscle was removed carefully under direct visualization. No complication occurred intra-operatively. Shoulder x-ray showed a well-placed, cemented humeral stem arthroplasty (Figure 2). On post-operative evaluation, patient had clinical evidence of complete radial nerve palsy; where else other peripheral nerves were intact. This initially attributed to the residual effects of interscalene block. However on discharge post-operative day 5, there was no improvement. DISCUSSION: Complications related to shoulder implant arthroplasty are well documented. Incidence of complications approached 14%.3 These include instability, rotator cuff tear, ectopic ossification, glenoid loosening, intraoperative fracture, nerve injury, infection and humeral loosening. No vascular injury was reported. Most cases of nerve injury are neuropraxia involving the axillary nerve, musculocutaneous nerve, median and ulnar nerves.3 Age, sex, height, weight, preoperative diagnosis, and coexistant rotator cuff disease were not statistically significant risk factors.2 We believe that tractional injury on the brachial plexus during surgery is likely mechanism of injury. Placing the shoulder in excessive abduction, extension and external rotation for prolonged period of time especially during removal of the humeral head from the pectoralis major muscle may have caused tractional injury to the posterior cord. (Figure Parsented) CONCLUSION(S): Although neurovascular injury after shoulder replacement surgery is rare, its occurrence could lead to significant impairment. Knowledge of shoulder anatomy, meticulous surgical technique and proper positioning and traction can decrease the chance of occurrence of this injury. Patient education regarding this injury should be advocated.",Excluded
314,"Laparotomy-staged IA versus IIA Hodgkin's disease. A comparative study with evaluation of prognostic factors for stage IIA disease. Ninety-one laparotomy-staged (LAP) IA and IIA Hodgkin's disease (HD) patients were analyzed to evaluate the prognostic significance of stage, mediastinal status, extranodal disease and histology. Forty IA patients were treated with radiotherapy (XRT) only; of 51 IIA patients, 44 received XRT only and 7 had additional chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 and 10 years was 81% and 70%, respectively, with overall survival (S) of 93% and 86%, respectively. Disease-free survival for IA patients (93% at 5 and 10 years) was significantly superior to IIA (73% at 5 years, 52% at 10 years). Survival differences were not statistically significant. For IIA patients receiving XRT only, large mediastinal disease was an adverse factor for DFS. Small mediastinal disease in IIA was significantly better than no mediastinal disease. For the whole group of LAP IA and IIA treated by XRT only, three prognostic groups were identified: (1) Stage IA and Stage IIA with mediastinal disease, but less than 7.5 cm in width was highly favorable with less than 10% relapse; (2) Stage IIA nonmediastinal had an intermediate prognosis with relapse in about 33%; (3) Stage IIA large mediastinal (greater than or equal to 7.5 cm) had an unfavorable DFS with relapse in about 55%. The third group contained a highly unfavorable subset with mediastinal masses greater than 10 cm, all of whom relapsed. Salvage therapy was successful in 60% of relapsing patients. In the context of relatively effective salvage therapy, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in adverse prognostic groups is discussed and it is concluded that the only clearly justifiable use for adjuvant chemotherapy is in patients with massive (greater than 10 cm) mediastinal adenopathy.",Excluded
1019,"Generation of boundary manikin anthropometry. The purpose of this study was to develop 3D digital 'boundary manikins' that are representative of the anthropometry of a unique population. These digital manikins can be used by designers to verify and validate that the components of the spacesuit design satisfy the requirements specified in the Human Systems Integration Requirements (HSIR) document. Currently, the HSIR requires the next generation space suit to accommodate the 1st percentile American female to the 99th percentile American male. The manikin anthropometry was derived using two methods: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Whole Body Posture Based Analysis (WBPBA). PCA is a statistical method for reducing a multidimensional data set by using eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The goal was to create a reduced data set that encapsulates the majority of the variation in the population. WBPBA is a multivariate analytical approach that was developed by the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) to identify the extremes of a population for a given body posture. WBPBA is a simulation-based method that finds extremes in a population based upon anthropometry and posture; whereas PCA is based solely on anthropometry. Both methods yielded a list of subjects and their anthropometry from a target population; PCA resulted in 20 female and 22 male subjects' anthropometry and WBPBA resulted in 7 subjects' anthropometry representing the extreme subjects in the target population. The subjects' anthropometry was then used to 'morph' a baseline digital scan of a person with the same body type to create a 3D digital model that can be used as a tool for designers.

3080,"Radiation therapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma in elderly patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcome and toxicities of radiation therapy alone for elderly patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Method(s): Seventy-three patients of 70 years old or above treated at our institution between January 1995 and December 2008 for locoregionally advanced NPC (stage III-IVA) were reviewed and analyzed. All patients were treated in a uniform fashion using our institutional protocol with using conformal radiation therapy alone. Measured outcomes included 4-year overall survival (OS), tumor-specific survival (TSS), disease-free survival (DFS), local control (LC), regional relapse-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS), as well as late toxicity. Result(s): The median follow-up for all 73 patients at the time of this analysis was 45 months (range, 5-152 months). The 4-year OS, TSS, DFS, LC, RRFS, and DMFS were 51.0, 64.5, 54.7, 83.7, 80.6, and 63.5, respectively. Radiation therapy was well tolerated in this group of patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that clinical stage (P = 0.006) and comorbidities (P = 0.018) were significant prognosticators for OS, both N classification (P = 0.023) and comorbidities (P = 0.032) were significant prognosticators for DFS, N classification was the only independent prognostic factor for both TSS (P = 0.002) and DMFS (P = 0.004); and residual disease in the primary site was the only independent predictive factor for LC (P = 0.026). Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy alone can achieve a reasonable local and regional control in NPC patients with advanced age; however, distant metastasis remained the dominant failure pattern of our series. The presence of comorbidities was an important negative prognostic factor for treatment outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2105,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers. Background: Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Method(s): Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Result(s): Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 muSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusion(s): [18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
3710,"First-arterial-pass dual-energy CT for assessment of myocardial blood supply: Do we need rest, stress, and delayed acquisition? Comparison with SPECT. Purpose: To compare the relative contributions of rest, stress, and delayed acquisitions with the accuracy of dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT) for the assessment of myocardial blood supply. Material(s) and Method(s): With institutional review board approval and HIPAA compliance, 55 consecutive patients (10 women, 45 men; mean age, 62 years 6 10) clinically referred for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) who were known to have or were suspected of having coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. DE CT studies were acquired during adenosine stress, at rest, and after 6-minute delay. The DE CT iodine distribution maps were visually assessed for perfusion deficits or late iodine enhancement. Per-segment agreement between modalities was investigated with k statistics. Test characteristics for the detection of perfusion deficits were calculated for combinations of rest, stress, and delayed DE CT acquisition, with SPECT as reference standard. Result(s): At SPECT, 714 segments were considered normal, 192 showed fixed perfusion defects, and 29 showed reversible perfusion deficits. Sensitivity of rest-only DE CT was 92%, and specificity was 98%. Stress-only, rest-stress, stress and delayed, and the combination of all three had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 97%. Of 29 segments with reversible perfusion deficits at SPECT, 13 (45%) were misclassified by using rest-stress DE CT as fixed perfusion deficits. With stress DE CT plus delayed acquisition, 13 of 192 (7%) segments with fixed perfusion deficits at SPECT were misclassified as reversible. Conclusion(s): Rest-stress acquisition should be the protocol of choice for assessment of the myocardial blood supply in DE CT. The accuracy of DE CT is not increased by the addition of a delayed DE CT acquisition, which may therefore be omitted to reduce radiation exposure. With rest-stress DE CT, almost one-half of defects that are reversible at SPECT were classified as fixed; radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of this incongruence when they interpret DE CT myocardial perfusion studies. © 2014 RSNA.",Excluded
218,"Trend dynamics of thyroid cancer incidence among China and the U.S. adult population from 1990 to 2017: a joinpoint and age-period-cohort analysis. BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common malignant disease of the endocrine system. Based on the previously published reports, the incidence of TC has been increasing in the past 25 years, and the reason for the increase is not yet clear. The present study aims to reveal the long-term trends and age-period-cohort effects for the incidence of TC in China and the U.S. from 1990 to 2017., METHODS: We examined the trends of TC incidence and the average annual percentage change (AAPC) of rate using the Joinpoint regression analysis in the two countries, for the different genders (men/women) in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2017). We further used an age-period-cohort model to analyze age-period-cohort effects on TC incidence., RESULTS: The ASIR of China increased markedly with AAPC of 4.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 4.0, 5.0%) and 1.8% (1.6, 2.0%) for men and women during 1990-2017. The ASIR of the U. S increased by 1.4% (1.0, 1.8%) and 1.3% (0.9, 1.7%) for men and women from 1990 to 2017.TC increased with the age and period. Aging was one of the most influential factors of TC in China. The age effect increased markedly in the U.S. compared with China. The period effect showed an increase in China while that tended to grow steadily during 1990-2017 in the U.S. The cohort effect peaked in 1963-1967 birth cohorts for men and women in China and declined consistently in the birth cohort in the U.S., CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2017, due to ionizing radiation and over-diagnosis, age-standardized TC incidence rates in both genders rose in China and the U.S. The standardized incidence rate of women is higher than that of men. It is necessary to provide women with reasonable prevention and protection measures for TC. We need to apply for health services and screening to reduce ionizing radiation.",Excluded
938,"Influence of preoperative femoral orientation on radiographic measures of femoral head height in total hip replacement. Background: In total hip arthroplasty the surgeon aims to restore the biomechanics of the joint. Femoral height has the greatest influence on restoring limb length and contributes equally to the restoration of femoral head centre. On X-ray, the level of femoral neck resection is most often referenced off the upper border of lesser trochanter. Less frequently, femoral head centre is referenced from the tip of the greater trochanter. The error in measurement of femoral height resulting from unknown femoral rotation is crucially important and can result in inappropriate surgical planning for implant selection and placement. It is unknown which reference produces lower error. Method(s): A sample of femoral shapes was generated using a femoral statistical shape model. These were placed in a range of orientations in terms of external rotation and flexion, at intervals of 10degree. Simulated X-rays were then produced and the distances from the tip of either greater or lesser trochanter to femoral head centre were measured. Finding(s): Although using greater trochanter as a reference demonstrated greater errors at the extremes, both techniques resulted in errors of 7-8 mm with 20degree of both femoral external rotation and flexion. Interpretation(s): Moderate degrees of femoral external rotation combined with flexion can result in unsatisfactory errors when templating limb length. There should be greater focus and an agreed definition for femoral height. There is a clinical need for a method with a lower error in determining true femoral height and the level of neck resection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2005,"Climate is a strong predictor of near-infrared reflectance but a poor predictor of colour in butterflies. Colour variation across climatic gradients is a common ecogeographical pattern; yet there is long-standing contention over underlying causes, particularly selection for thermal benefits. We tested the evolutionary association between climate gradients and reflectance of near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, which influence heat gain but are not visible to animals. We measured ultraviolet (UVA), visible (Vis) and NIR reflectance from calibrated images of 372 butterfly specimens from 60 populations (49 species, five families) spanning the Australian continent. Consistent with selection for thermal benefits, the association between climate and reflectance was stronger for NIR than UVA-Vis wavelengths. Furthermore, climate predicted reflectance of the thorax and basal wing, which are critical to thermoregulation; but it did not predict reflectance of the entire wing, which has a variable role in thermoregulation depending on basking behaviour. These results provide evidence that selection for thermal benefits has shaped the reflectance properties of butterflies.",Excluded
1677,"Micromorphology of sialoliths in submandibular salivary gland: A scanning electron microscope and X-ray diffraction analysis. Sialoliths are common in the submandibular gland and its duct system. The exact cause of formation of a sialolith is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to analyze 6 sialoliths ultrastructurally to determine their development mechanism in the submandibular salivary glands. Six sialoliths retrieved from the hilus and duct of the submandibular salivary glands of 6 patients with sialadenitis were analyzed ultrastructurally by scanning electron microscope and x-ray diffractometer. Scanning electron microscope revealed mainly irregular, partly rudely hexagonal, needle-like and plate-shaped crystals. The cross-section from the surface to the inner part of the sialoliths showed no organic material. X-ray diffraction showed that the sialoliths were composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. Energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis showed that all of the samples contained high levels of Ca and P, and small amounts of Mg, Na, Cl, Si, Fe, and K. The main structures of the submandibular sialoliths were found to be hydroxyapatite crystals. No organic cores were observed in the central parts of the sialoliths. In accordance with these preliminary results, sialoliths in the submandibular salivary glands may arise secondary to sialadenitis, but not via a luminal organic nidus. © 2004 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.",Excluded
515,"Fluoroscopic Exposure With Use of Mini-C-Arm During Routine Hand Surgery: A Prospective Comparison of Hand Versus Eye Radiation Dosage. Radiation exposure with use of intraoperative fluoroscopy is a potential orthopedic occupational risk factor. The purpose of this study was to perform a prospective comparison of hand versus eye radiation exposure associated with mini-C-arm utilization and to test the hypothesis that routine mini-C-arm does not yield hand or eye dosages exceeding current recommended levels. Over a 12-month period, hand and eye radiation exposure was prospectively measured in a single board-certified hand surgeon using mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Twenty-five cases were performed utilizing mini-C-arm fluoroscopy. Average monthly hand radiation dosage (45.81+/-14.49 mrem) was significantly higher (p = .01) than eye radiation dosage (<30 mrem). Both recorded values were below their respective critical exposure limits, as reported by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. The findings suggest that hand and eye exposure associated with mini-C-arm utilization during routine surgery does not approach reported levels of critical radiation loads.",Excluded

In our Department, the technique of large mantle fields has proved to be a good therapeutic means for supradiaphragmatic and infradiaphragmatic irradiation of several lymph node groups in one irradiation field. With this technique the lymph node groups needing a treatment can be irradiated without overlappings or gaps, and thus the therapy reliability is considerably improved. The side effects are limited with respect to the large volume dose, in the individual case they can easily be eliminated by reducing the single dose. Gastrointestinal side effects can be controlled by chemotherapy in a satisfactory manner. Only in very few cases the modifications of the white blood count necessitated a short interruption of the therapy cycle. Furthermore, the simplified and easily reproducible focussing of the individual fields is especially appreciated by the technical staff.",Excluded
1056,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease. BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

2190,"Melanocortin 1 Receptor-Targeted alpha-Particle Therapy for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma. New effective therapies are greatly needed for metastatic uveal melanoma, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 y. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanoma metastases, and a MC1R-specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R was previously developed. Methods: The 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL conjugate was synthesized in high radiochemical yield and purity and was tested in vitro for biostability and for MC1R-specific cytotoxicity in uveal melanoma cells, and the lanthanum-DOTA-MC1RL analog was tested for binding affinity. Non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were tested for maximum tolerated dose and biodistribution. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing uveal melanoma tumors or engineered MC1R-positive and -negative tumors were studied for biodistribution and efficacy. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using mouse biodistribution data and blood clearance kinetics from Sprague-Dawley rat data. Results: High biostability, MC1R-specific cytotoxicity, and high binding affinity were observed. Limiting toxicities were not observed at even the highest administered activities. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance (<15 min), renal and hepatobillary excretion, MC1R-specific tumor uptake, and minimal retention in other normal tissues. Radiation dosimetry calculations determined pharmacokinetics parameters and absorbed alpha-emission dosages from 225Ac and its daughters. Efficacy studies demonstrated significantly prolonged survival and decreased metastasis burden after a single administration of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL in treated mice relative to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest significant potential for the clinical translation of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL as a novel therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.

UNLABELLED: The study aim was to assess the safety, biodistribution, tissue kinetics, and tumor uptake of the (99m)Tc-labeled neurotensin (NT) analog NT-XI., METHODS: Four patients presenting ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma were studied with (99m)Tc-NT-XI. Patients were followed by scintigraphy up to 4 h and by continued blood and urinary sampling until surgery 18-22 h after injection. Surgical tissue samples were analyzed for radioactivity uptake and NT receptor expression., RESULTS: No side effects were observed on injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI. Blood biologic half-lives alpha and beta were 35 min (range, 17-62 min) and 230 min (range, 107-383 min), respectively. Repeated whole-body scintigraphy performed in 2 patients showed a single exponential decrease of whole-body activity with half-lives of 101 and 232 min. Tracer elimination was mainly renal, with 92% and 98% of activity counted in urine in the first 20 h. Kidney, liver, spleen, and bone marrow activity uptake was observed in all patients. Tumor was not visualized in the first 3 patients but could be localized by tomoscintigraphy in the pancreas head region of patient 4. In vitro tissue analysis showed high expression of NT receptor in the tumor of patient 4, correlated with the highest tumor radioactivity uptake and the highest tumor-to-fat radioactivity ratio. In vitro receptor expression was also positive in a second patient having a tumor characterized by very low cellularity; however, the remaining 2 tumors lacked NT receptor expression., CONCLUSION: Injection of (99m)Tc-NT-XI was well tolerated. The in vivo tumor uptake appeared specific as it was observed in the 1 patient with a pancreatic tumor that expressed high amounts of NT receptor. The results are compatible with preclinical animal results and in favor of further development of radiolabeled NT analogs for diagnosis or therapy of cancer.",Excluded
331,"Skin Dose Reduction by Layer-Stacking Irradiation in Carbon Ion Radiotherapy for Parotid Tumors. Background: Layer-stacking irradiation (LSI) results in the accumulation of multiple small spread-out Bragg peaks along the beam direction. Although the superiority of LSI to conventional passive irradiation (CPI) regarding normal tissue sparing is theoretically evident, the clinical benefit of LSI has not been demonstrated. Here, we compared LSI with CPI using the same treatment planning-computed tomography images used for carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT). Method(s): Twenty-one parotid tumors were analyzed. The clinical target volume (CTV) 1 and CTV2 encompassed the parotid grand and the tumor, respectively. CTV1 and CTV2 received 36 Gy (RBE: relative biological effectiveness) in nine fractions and 64 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions, respectively, using either LSI or CPI. CTV coverage was assessed by DX%, which is the dose covering at least X% of the target volume. Skin dose was assessed by SX, which is the skin surface area receiving at least X Gy (RBE). Result(s): For CTV1 and CTV2, there were no significant differences in D2% between LSI and CPI. D50% and D98% were slightly higher for CPI; however, the absolute difference between the two methods was <3%. S10-S60 (in increments of 10) were significantly lower for LSI than for CPI (P < 0.001 for all parameters). LSI was associated with a significant trend toward dose reduction at the skin area irradiated with a higher dose by CPI (P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): LSI achieved better skin sparing than CPI without sacrificing target volume coverage in parotid tumor patients.© Copyright © 2020 Kubo, Kubota, Oike, Kawamura, Sakai, Imamura, Komatsu, Miyasaka, Sato, Musha, Okano, Shirai, Saitoh, Chikamatsu and Ohno.",Excluded

This paper aims to fill this gap with reference to the recovery process in Fukushima City following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami in Japan., METHODS: Open access data were sourced from the 2015 Social Survey on Living and Disaster Recovery (SSLDR) (N = 1439) of Fukushima citizens. Pearson's Chi-square Test and the t-test were employed to examine gender differences with regard to happiness and exploratory variables. Following this, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the determinants of happiness., RESULTS: The results showed that, compared to females, male respondents were unhappier and reported more property loss and less neighborhood connectedness. Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded
2741,"Hormonal suppression restores fertility in irradiated mice from both endogenous and donor-derived stem spermatogonia. Irradiation interrupts spermatogenesis and causes prolonged sterility in male mammals. Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

This study assessed the utility of dual-energy pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) for noninvasive assessment of regional pulmonary perfusion in patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Regional perfusion abnormalities were correlated with hemodynamic parameters and structural abnormalities on pulmonary CTA. SUBJECTS and methods. Twenty patients with CTEPH (11 men and nine women; mean age, 61.5 years) underwent pulmonary CTA with a dual-energy technique. Right heart catheterization data were available in 15 cases. Scan parameters were as follows: tube A, 140 kV (75 mA); tube B, 80 kV (300 mA); gantry rotation, 500 milliseconds; pitch, 0.5; and collimation, 14 x 1.2 mm. An iodine map was generated via three-material- decomposition and was scored for extent of hypoperfusion. Correlation was made with mosaic attenuation pattern, extent of vascular obstruction, and right heart hemodynamics. Iodine attenuation values were analyzed within completely occluded, partially occluded, and disease-free lobes. Results . A strong correlation existed between dual-energy CT-derived perfusion and mosaic attenuation pattern when both lobar (r > 0.6; n = 20; p < 0.006) and whole-lung scores were assessed (r = 0.77; n = 20; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant correlation between dual-energy CT perfusion and vascular obstructive index, mean pulmonary artery pressure, or pulmonary vascular resistance (p > 0.08). Of 42 completely occluded lobes, 27 (64%) had demonstrable residual perfusion (mismatching), suggesting that blood supply was maintained via systemic collaterals. Conclusion. Dual-energy CT can offer a ""one-stop"" assessment of anatomy and perfusion in CTEPH.

1433,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry. Background: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk. Case Description: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of low-dose MDCT for radiologic monitoring of patients who have undergone placement of bronchial stents for airway bypass., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, seven patients underwent MDCT according to a low-dose protocol (40 mAs, 120 kVp) before and after stent placement. The positions of the stents in the segmental bronchi were analyzed and compared with the bronchoscopic findings, which were reference standard. Patency versus lack of patency of stents was classified with five levels of confidence, and a definitive diagnosis was assigned to each stent. Prediction of stent dislodgment, follow-up findings, and complications occurring during the observation period were recorded. Consensus reading was performed by two radiologists. Statistical analysis was conducted by receiver operating characteristic analysis or four-field table., RESULTS: Seven patients underwent implantation of 37 stents (mean, 5 +/- 2 [SD] stents per patient; range, 2-8 stents). The area under the curve for differentiating patent from occluded stents was 0.995 with resulting sensitivity and specificity of 86.5% and 98.1%. The correct diagnosis of patency was established with MDCT for all but one stent (sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity for prediction of dislodgment were 80% and 91%. Five stents were not identified during inspection bronchoscopy but were found in a regular position at MDCT. Three instances of minor bleeding and one of pneumothorax resolved spontaneously.

3434,"A Pilot Study of Safer Radiation Dosage to the Heart and Its Subregions. Background and Objectives: The real impact of ionizing radiation on the heart and poorer overall survival for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the safe dose constraints to the heart's subregions that could prevent patients' early non-cancerous death and improve their quality of life. Methods and Materials: A retrospective cohort study was performed containing 51 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and treated using 3D, Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy. For a dosimetric analysis, these structures were chosen: heart, heart base (HB), and region of great blood vessels (GBV). Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were recorded for all mentioned structures. Maximum and mean doses to the heart, HB, the muscle mass of the HB, and GBV were obtained. V10-V60 (%) parameters were calculated from the DVH. After performed statistical analysis, logistic regression models were created, and critical doses calculated. Result(s): The critical dose for developing a fatal endpoint for HB was 30.5 Gy, while for GBV, it was 46.3 Gy. Increasing the average dose to the HB or GBV by 1 Gy from the critical dose further increases the possibility of early death by 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We suggest that the non-canonical sub-regions of the heart (HB and GBV) should be considered during the planning stage. Additional constraints of the heart subregions should be chosen accordingly, and we propose that the mean doses to these regions be 30.5 Gy and 46.3 Gy, respectively, or less.

BACKGROUND: Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) has become the standard approach for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC), most patients are not candidates for this treatment because of comorbidities. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in LA-NSCLC patients., METHODS: Patients with stage IIA to IIIA (UICC 7th edition) LA-NSCLC were enrolled in a sequential phase I/II trial. For a phase I dose escalation study, the total prescribed dose was increased by 4 Gray equivalents (GyE) in 2 steps, from 68 to 72 GyE and then to 76 GyE, using 16 fractions over 4 weeks. After determining the recommended dose, the phase II trial was started in an expanded cohort., RESULTS: Of the 36 patients treated in phase I, 2 grade 3 adverse events (radiation pneumonitis and tracheoesophageal fistula) were observed in the 76 GyE group. Accordingly, for phase II, the next consecutive 26 patients were treated with 72 GyE, with no grade 3 to 5 toxicities resulting. A total of 62 eligible patients were recruited. The majority of patients (49 of 62) were N0 or N1 patients, and the rest (13 of 62) were single-station N2 patients. The median follow-up period was 25.2 months.

Partially segregated neuronal pathways (""what"" and ""where"" pathways, respectively) are thought to mediate sound recognition and localization. Less studied are interactions between these pathways. In two experiments, we investigated whether near-threshold pitch discrimination sensitivity (d') is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant position differences and likewise whether near-threshold position discrimination sensitivity is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant pitch differences. Each experiment followed a 2 x 2 within-subjects design regarding changes/no change in the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. In Experiment 1, subjects discriminated between 750 Hz and 752 Hz pure tones, and d' for this near-threshold pitch change significantly increased by a factor of 1.09 when accompanied by a task-irrelevant position change of 65 micros interaural time difference (ITD). No response bias was induced by the task-irrelevant position change. In Experiment 2, subjects discriminated between 385 micros and 431 micros ITDs, and d' for this near-threshold position change significantly increased by a factor of 0.73 when accompanied by task-irrelevant pitch changes (6 Hz). In contrast to Experiment 1, task-irrelevant pitch changes induced a response criterion bias toward responding that the two stimuli differed.

Objectives/Purpose: Aim of this study was to retrospectively compare the image quality and the radiation dose of an ultra high pitch CT scan for the evaluation of pulmonary embolism and visualization of cardiac structures in comparison to our institution's standard pulmonary embolism protocol. Method and materials: The study cohort consisted of 115 consecutive patients, 57 underwent CT pulmonary angiography on a dual source 128 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition FLASH) via an ultra high pitch mode (Pitch 2.8) while 58 were scanned on a dual source 64 slice scanner (Siemens Somatom Definition Dual Source) with standard pitch (Pitch 0.9). Qualitative image assessment was determined by two blinded radiologists with 3 and 15 years' experience in chest and cardiac CT. Quantitative image assessment was determined by the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Effective radiation dose was calculated via the product of the dose length product. Result(s): For the ultra high pitch protocol, 14% (8/57) were positive for pulmonary embolus compared to 13.7% (8/58) for the standard pitch group. 98.2% of the ultra high pitch scans were diagnostic for pulmonary embolus vs. 94.8% of the standard protocol. Visualization of cardiac structures was significantly improved with the ultra high pitch protocol (p < 0.0001). Significantly more lung parenchymal motion was observed on the standard protocol (p < 0.0001). The mean pulmonary vessel attenuation, SNR, and CNR were not significantly different. The mean effective dose was lower for the ultra high pitch studies (4.09 mSv +/- 0.78 vs. 7.72 mSv +/- 2.60, p < 0.0001).

However, according to previous studies, only 60 to 90% of the global skeletal affection by PDB is included in the area of an abdominal radiograph [1]. In order toknow with certainty the real prevalence of PDB in any population, usually assessed by abdominal radiographs, we need to know the percentage of patients with PDB without pagetic affection of bones included in an abdominal x-ray. Objectives To estimate the percentage of PBD patients without skeletal affection in the pelvis, lumbar spine and/or proximal femur to assess the underestimation of the prevalence of PDB assessed by abdominal radiographs. Methods Transversal descriptive study based on medical records of 602 patients from the Spanish National PBD Register [2]. We included consecutive patients with a skeletal radionuclide scintigraphy and alkaline phosphatase measurement in the year of the diagnosis. We excluded patients treated with bisphosphonates or calcitonin in the previous five years. A central lecture of scintigraphies was made by expert rheumatologists, who identified the pagetic bones included in an abdominal radiograph and in the whole skeleton. Results 214 (36%) bone scans were analyzed. There were not significant differences (p>0.25) between the included patients and patients from the Register in age, gender and time from diagnosis. The percentage of patients with PDB in the lumbar spine, pelvis and/or proximal femur was 80% (IC 95%: [74%>85%]), without differences by gender. This implies that 1/5 of patients are not diagnosed of PDB if only abdominal x-rays are analyzed. New PDB prevalence estimation in Spain is 1.2% (0.9%>1.6%), being 1.5% (1%>2.1%) in men and 1% (0.7%>1.5%) in women. Figure 1 shows the percentage of patients with pagetic involvement in each area. Conclusions Evaluation by abdominal x-rays underestimates 1/5 of patients with Paget's disease of bone. According to these data, the prevalence of this disease in Spain is 1.2%. This study provides the clues for estimating the real prevalence of Paget's disease worldwide.",Excluded
29,"Heavy ion radiotherapy in lung cancer. (Introduction) In radiotherapy of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carbon ion beams offer improved dose distributions as compared to photon beams and thus enable dose escalation within a target while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions being heavier than protons provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the range. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), clinical research on carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was started in 1994 using carbon-ions generated by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). So far, almost 6,000 patients have been treated, where the benefit of C-ion RT over other modalities has been demonstrated in terms of high local control rates and a significant reduction in overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities in most cases. In this paper, the results of treatment for Stage I NSCLC using 9 and 4 fractions are reviewed, as well as preliminary results of single fraction treatment is described. Also, results of other RT reported in the literatures are compared. (Methods and materials) Stage I lung cancer is divided into two types depending on tumor location: peripheral-type and central-type. This classification is made on the assumption that the two types may tolerate radiation differently. Therefore, different fractionation regimens were investigated for each type. The patients eligible for either treatment are those for whom surgery was not indicated due to medical reasons or refusal. From 1999 to 2003, a total of 131 tumors in129 patients received C-ion RT with 9 fractions and 4 fractions, including 94 males and 37 females with an average age of 74.5 years. Out of the 131 foci, there were 72 T1 tumors and 59 T2 tumors. There were 85 adenocarcinomas, 43 epidermoid cancers and 3 other types. Regarding dose fractionations, 51 cases were treated with 72.0GyE/9 fractions, and 80 cases were treated with 52.8GyE/4fr for stage IA and 60.0GyE/4fr for stage IB. Since 2003, a doseescalation study using single fraction treatment has been conducted for peripheral-type NSCLC. The initial dose was 28.0 GyE, which was then escalated at increments of 5%. At each dose level, about 10 to 30 patients were registered for evaluation of toxicity and local control with carbon ions. C-ion RT has also been applied to locally advanced lung cancers and hilar-type cancers, and case studies are being accumulated. The locally advanced lung cancers included Pancoast tumors and mediastinal-type tumors in stages II-IIIA. (Results) All of the patients treated with 9 fractions/3 weeks (50 patients) and 4 fractions/1 week (79 patients) developed no evidence of severe toxicities. The 5-year local control rates were 98.6% for stage-IA cases and 89.7% for stage- IB cases, and the 5-year survival rates were 63.1% for stage-IA cases and 50.0% for stage-IB cases. In single fraction treatment, a total of 218 patients have been registered, in which the total dose has been escalated from 28.0 to 48.0 GyE. So far, no serious adverse events have been observed, and local control appears to be improving with increasing total dose. For skin reactions, six grade 2 toxicity (3.3%) but no grade 3 or higher was observed. For radiation pneumonitis, only one grade 1 was reported, and no toxicities greater than grade 2 occurred. The overall local control rate was 91.8%, and the causespeci fic survival rate at 5-years was 71.8%. The superficial lesions arising at the hilar region have been successfully treated with acceptable toxicities. Similarly, in the preoperative radiotherapy for patients with chest wall invasion, high anti-tumor effect was confirmed in the pathological findings after the lung was surgically removed. (Discussion) Only at NIRS, Japan, NSCLC has been treated with carbon ions. For peripheral tumor, we have been conducting clinical studies to establish a short-course, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy. We first performed a dose-escalation study using 18 fractions/6 weeks. The number of fractions and treatment times were subsequently reduced to 9 fractions over 3 weeks, 4 fractions over one week, and eventually to a single fraction treatment. The preliminary data suggested favorable local control and very few toxic reactions with a median follow up time of about 16 months. Compared with pulmonary damage reported for stereotactic radiotherapy in stage I lung cancer, the incidence and severity in our patients seemed to be remarkably low. The decreased adverse effects on the lung are likely achieved due to the small volume irradiated. When comparing proton vs C-ion RT, local control results are comparable for T1 tumors, but for T2 tumors 2-5 year local control rates are higher in C-ion RT. It is of note that in most reported data for proton therapy, follow-up periods are short relative to the time required for full evaluation of TCP, late NTCP and survival. Considering that the average age of the patients receiving C-ion RT was about 75 years, about 10 years older than that of 65 years in the operated patients, the results of C-ion RT for stage-I lung cancer may be comparable to surgical results. Thus, the single-fraction irradiation method may be described as the ultimate type of treatment using carbon ion, and would be a valid alternative to surgery, especially for elderly and inoperable patients.",Excluded
262,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients. Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
84,"Boron neutron capture therapy combined with early successive bevacizumab treatments for recurrent malignant gliomas - A pilot study. Recurrent malignant gliomas (RMGs) are difficult to control, and no standard protocol has been established for their treatment. At our institute, we have often treated RMGs by tumor-selective particle radiation called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). However, despite the cell-selectivity of BNCT, brain radiation necrosis (BRN) may develop and cause severe neurological complications and sometimes death. This is partly due to the full-dose X-ray treatments usually given earlier in the treatment course. To overcome BRN following BNCT, recent studies have used bevacizumab (BV). We herein used extended BV treatment beginning just after BNCT to confer protection against or ameliorate BRN, and evaluated; the feasibility, efficacy, and BRN control of this combination treatment. Seven patients with RMGs (grade 3 and 4 cases) were treated with BNCT between June 2013 and May 2014, followed by successive BV treatments. They were followed-up to December 2017. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after combination treatment were 15.1 and 5.4 months, respectively. In one case, uncontrollable brain edema occurred and ultimately led to death after BV was interrupted due to meningitis. In two other cases, symptomatic aggravation of BRN occurred after interruption of BV treatment. No BRN was observed during the observation period in the other cases. Common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 2 and 3 proteinuria occurred in two cases and necessitated the interruption of BV treatments. Boron neutron capture therapy followed by BV treatments well-prevented or well-controlled BRN with prolonged OS and acceptable incidence of adverse events in our patients with RMG.Copyright © 2018 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
1002,"Effects of prolonged weightlessness on mental rotation of three-dimensional objects. Previous experiments have suggested that the analysis of visual images could be a gravity-dependent process. We investigated this hypothesis using a mental rotation paradigm with pictures of three-dimensional objects during a 26-day orbital flight aboard the Soviet MIR station. The analysis of cosmonauts' response times showed that the mental rotation task is not greatly impaired in weightlessness. On the contrary, there are indications of a facilitation as: (1) the average rotation time per degree was shorter inflight than on the ground; (2) this difference seemed to be particularly marked for stimuli calling for roll axis rotations. However several factors may be responsible for this difference which was not obvious in one subject.

2543,"Radiation exposure during percutaneous nephrostomy. Radiation doses of radiologists, assistants and patients during 21 percutaneous nephrostomies (PN) (including 11 unilateral and 5 bilateral procedures) were measured using an area-exposure meter and thermoluminescent dosimeters. The mean fluoroscopy time per PN was 12 min and the mean product of air kerma and the cross-sectional area of the fluoroscopic beam was 8.0 (range 0.41-24) Gycm2. Doses to the radiologists and assistants were generally modest, and the yearly dose limits of ICRP will not be exceeded in practice. The doses to the radiologist's fingers were found to be the most restrictive in this study. Regarding the mean dose to the radiologist's fingers (190 muGy), the yearly dose limit of 500 mSv would be exceeded after about 2600 PNs provided that his fingers are not otherwise exposed. With the maximal finger dose of 1100 muGy, this would occur after about 450 yearly PNs.",Excluded
1152,"S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel criterion for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias. Aim: The correct estimation of the VA origin as RVOT or LVOT results in reduced ablation duration reduced radiation exposure and decreased number of vascular access. In our study, we aimed to detect the predictive value of S-R difference in V1-V2 for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias. Method(s): We included 123 patients with symptomatic frequent premature ventricular outflow tract contractions who underwent successful catheter ablation (70 male, 53 female; mean age 46.2 +/- 13.9 years, 61 RVOT, 62 LVOT origins). S-R difference in V1-V2 was calculated with this formula on the 12-lead surface ECG: (V1S + V2S) - (V1R + V2R). Conventional ablation was performed in 101 (82.1%) patients, CARTO electroanatomic mapping system was used in 22 (17.9%) patients. Result(s): V1-2 SRd was found to be significantly lower for LVOT origins than RVOT origins (p <.001). The cutoff value of V1-2 SRd obtained by ROC curve analysis was 1.625 mV for prediction of RVOT origin (sensitivity: 95.1%, specificity: 85.5%, positive predictive value: 86.5%, negative predictive value: 94.5%). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.929 (p <.001). Conclusion(s): S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel and simple electrocardiographic criterion for accurately differentiating RVOT from LVOT sites of ventricular arrhythmia origins. The use of this simple ECG measurement could improve the accuracy of OTVA localization, could be beneficial for decreasing ablation duration and radiation exposure. Further studies with larger patient population are needed to verify the results of this study.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2094,"The effect of oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and high-dose proton pump inhibitors on the histology of Barrett's esophagus. Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Bile composition can be influenced by oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We prospectively investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) supplemented with UDCA in vivo in patients with BE. Patients with no or low-grade dysplasia who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI were eligible for the study. In order to exclude the effects of acid reflux, all patients were initially treated with 40 mg esomeprazole (ESO) twice daily for 6 months and continued on this dose till the end of the study (t = 12 months). During a period of 6 months (t = 6 month - t = 12 month) patients were treated with oral UDCA (600 mg twice daily). Patients underwent endoscopy at t = 0 months, t = 6 months and t = 12 months with multiple biopsies of the distal and proximal BE segment, normal squamous and gastric cardia. In addition, pH was measured at t = 0 months and t = 6 months using a BRAVO wireless pH capsule. Bile was sampled at the beginning of the UDCA treatment and 6 months later (t = 6 month and t = 12 month). All biopsies were reviewed for the extent of metaplasia, dysplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation. In addition, proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (villin, cytokeratins 7 and 20) and inflammation (COX-2) were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nine patients (mean age 60 years, median BE length 7 cm) were included, of whom six had no dysplasia and three had low-grade dysplasia. pH measurements revealed a normal acid exposure in most patients at t = 0 and t = 6 months. In addition, bile composition analysis demonstrated the efficacy of UDCA. Combining the results of both phases of the study, no significant changes were seen in any of the histological or IHC parameters. Differentiation and proliferation parameters showed no significant changes. In this study, in BE patients who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI, increasing the PPI dose to the maximum for 6 months followed by the addition of UDCA for 6 months did not result in significant histological or IHC changes in their BE.",Excluded
2224,"Serial gadolinium-DTPA of spinal cord MRI in multiple sclerosis: Triple vs. single dose. We compared the sensitivity of single and triple dose Gd-DTPA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting enhancing lesions in the spinal cord (SC) from 15 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). The patients were examined monthly on four occasions. We detected two enhancing lesions in two of 15 (13%) patients when a single dose of Gd-DTPA was used. No additional lesions were detected when a triple dose of Gd-DTPA was used. These results 1) confirm that enhanced spinal cord imaging does not significantly increase the detection of active lesions in MS, 2) they do not support the general application of triple dose Gd-DTPA when examining the SC but 3) suggest that further studies taking into account SC symptoms are necessary.

1194,"Utility of Computed Tomography following Anterior Cervical Diskectomy and Fusion. Study Design Retrospective case series. Objective To assess the utility of postoperative computed tomography (CT) following anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion (ACDF) and to determine the clinical circumstances most likely to lead to an abnormal CT scan. Methods Patients who underwent ACDF at a tertiary center over a span of 5 years were investigated. Only patients who had a minimum of 6 months' postoperative follow-up and a CT within 2 years after the surgery were included in the study group. All the postoperative notes were reviewed to determine indications for the CT, abnormalities identified, and whether the scan led to an alteration in the treatment course. Results The charts of 690 patients who underwent ACDF were reviewed. Of the 690 patients, 45 (7%) had postoperative CTs. These patients accounted for 53 postoperative CT scans, 45 (85%) of which were taken for patients who expressed persistent postoperative symptoms and/or had abnormal imaging. There were no indications for 8 (15%) of the CTs. Patients who had a CT for persistent symptoms and/or abnormal preliminary imaging were significantly more likely to have an abnormal CT (p = 0.03) and/or an alteration in treatment course (p = 0.04) compared with those with no symptomatic or radiologic indication for CT. Conclusions CT is associated with minimal utility regarding the alteration of treatment course when employed in asymptomatic patients. Postoperative CT should be ordered solely for symptomatic patients or those with other abnormal preliminary imaging. Judicious use of postoperative CT will limit the radiation exposure and cost.Copyright © 2015 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",Excluded
224,"Compartments and cell flows within the mouse haemopoietic system. II. Estimated rates of interchange. Part-body irradiated CBA mice were injected with CBA-T6 bone marrow. In this way a predominantly donor population was established in the femora while the marrow of the humeri remained largely (average 94%) of host origin. In animals examined cytologically up to 2 years later, no tendency was observed for the proportion of donor cells in the humeri to increase. Splenectomy had no effect on this. When femoral bone marrow from the experimental mice was injected into lethally (whole-body) irradiated recipients, cells originating from the primary host repopulated the lymph nodes to a disproportionate extent. Equilibration between the cell populations of femora and humeri occurred after re-exposure to 600 rad whole-body irradiation, but not after 100 rad or 350 rad; thus, regeneration of damaged bone marrow involved a significant contribution from extrinsic stem cells only after the highest dose of radiation. The data are compatible with an inflow of at most ten effective stem cells per humerus per day from the blood, and suggest a much lower figure. This means that few if any of the stem cells of peripheral blood enter the bone marrow and found haemopoietic clones. Evidence is adduced for the existence of a proliferating lymphoid sub-population in the bone marrow, contributing some 5-10% of the observed mitoses. The mitotic cells in the lymph nodes are replaced from marrow-derived progenitors at an estimated rate of 4-5%/day. The relevant data for the thymus are more variable, but suggest an average figure of 8-11%/day. Earlier data from mouse parabionts suggest a lower rate of inflow to the thymus.",Excluded
2006,"The Relationship between Media Consumption and Health-Related Anxieties after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster. Background:The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster caused a global panic by a release of harmful radionuclides. In a disaster setting, misusage of contemporary media sources available today can lead to disseminated incorrect information and panic. The study aims to build a scale which examines associations between media and individual anxieties, and to propose effective media usages for future disaster management. Method(s):The University of Tokyo collaborated with the Fukushima local government to conduct a radiation-health-seminar for a total of 1560 residents, at 12 different locations in Fukushima. A 13 item questionnaire collected once before and after a radiation-seminar was used on factor analysis to develop sub-scales for multiple regression models, to determine relationships between the sub-scales and media type consumed. A paired t-test was used to examine any changes in sub-scale of pre- and post-seminar scores. Result(s):Three sub-scales were revealed and were associated with different media types: was with rumors, while concern for the future was positively associated with regional-newspapers and negatively with national-newspapers. Anxiety about social-disruption was associated with radio. The seminar had a significant effect on anxiety reduction for all the three sub-scales. Conclusion(s):Different media types were associated with various heightened concerns, and that a radiation seminar was helpful to reduce anxieties in the post-disaster setting. By tailoring post-disaster messages via specific media types, i.e., radio, it may be possible to effectively convey important information, as well as to calm fears about particular elements of post-disaster recovery and to combat rumors. © 2013 Sugimoto et al.",Excluded
3176,"Phase 1 Fractional Dose-Escalation Study of Equipotent Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Regimens for Early-Stage Glottic Larynx Cancer. PURPOSE: Early-stage glottic larynx squamous cell carcinoma (GLC) is a relatively common disease with excellent oncologic control, but treatment is associated with acute dysphagia and long-term voice quality changes. This phase 1 study of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage GLC increased the fraction size while reducing the number of fractions until 5-fraction stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) was delivered., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had received a diagnosis of stage Tis to T2 GLC. Patients who had undergone prior curative-intent surgery were excluded. The equipotent dose levels were as follows: (1) level 0, 50 Gy in 15 fractions (n = 4); (2) level 1, 45 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 13); and (3) level 2, 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions (SABR level, n = 12). Grade 3 or 4 laryngeal edema, voice, dyspnea, stridor, or cough were the predefined dose-limiting toxicities., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled from November 2013 to March 2017. The median and minimum follow-up times were 39.2 and 13 months, respectively. Two actively smoking patients, 1 treated in level 1 (grade 4 laryngeal edema, grade 3 dysphagia) and 1 treated in level 2 (grade 3 laryngeal necrosis, dysphagia), developed dose-limiting toxicities. The former patient soon developed a local recurrence, and the latter patient recovered. There were a total of 5 local recurrences: 2 in level 0 and 3 in level 1. The Voice Handicap Index results showed robust long-term voice quality with median values of 7 and 0 at 6 and 12 months, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Given the tolerability, excellent voice outcomes, and preliminary efficacy data of 5-fraction glottic larynx SABR, this regimen warrants further study.

OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate outcomes among cancer survivors previously treated with thoracic radiotherapy (RT) who later underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS: From 1998 to 2012, 76 patients first received curative RT (>30 Gy, except for Hodgkin lymphoma patients) involving the heart and lungs followed by PCI. Heart and lung-specific dosimetric parameters were correlated with overall survival (OS) and cardiac-specific survival by Cox variate methods., RESULTS: The mean interval between cancer diagnosis and PCI was 3.7 years (range, 0.1 to 12.6 y). Median follow-up since cancer diagnosis was 5.5 years. At analysis, 46 patients (61%) were alive, 5 (7%) died of cardiac causes, and 9 (12%) of cancer. Higher maximum RT heart dose was related to poorer OS since PCI (P=0.009). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (P=0.005) and higher mean heart dose (P<0.001) were related to poorer OS since cancer diagnosis. beta-Blockers, higher mean heart dose (hazard ratio [HR]=1.49, P<0.001), and percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=40 Gy for heart doses (HR=1.32, P<0.001) were associated with poorer non-cancer-specific survival since cancer diagnosis. Diabetes (HR=3.84, P=0.008) and increased percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=45 Gy (HR=1.01 per additional 100 cm irradiated, P=0.01) for the heart decreased major adverse cardiac event-free survival., CONCLUSIONS: Prior heart and lung-directed RT had volume-dependent and dose-dependent adverse effects on long-term cardiac outcomes for patients subsequently treated with PCI.

2755,"Lower body negative pressure counters posture induced increases of intraocular pressure and intracranial pressure. Purpose: Recent ophthalmic evaluations of seven astronauts after six-month missions to International Space Station show unexpected vision impairment. In addition, lumbar punctures in four astronauts with optic disc edema showed moderate elevations of cerebral spinal fluid pressure after returning to Earth. This Visual Impairment Intracranial Pressure (VIIP) syndrome is likely related to a headward body fluid shift that elevates intracranial pressure (ICP). We hypothesized that a moderate level of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) would counteract head down, body-tilt, induced elevations in IOP and ICP. Method(s): Twenty-five normal healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in this study (mean age: 31 years). Right and left IOP, ICP (non-invasive ultrasound pulsed phase locked loop), arm blood pressure, and heart rate were measured during the last minute of each testing condition. Subjects were positioned supine (5 mins), sitting (5 mins), 15-degrees head-down tilt (HDT) (5 mins) and ten minutes of HDT with LBNP (25 mmHg). The order of HDT and HDT+LBNP tests were balanced. The right and left IOP values were averaged and used for statistical analysis (significance accepted at p<0.05). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation. The change from supine was calculated for IOP values. Result(s): IOP significantly decreased from supine to sitting posture by 3.2 +/- 1.4 mmHg, and increased by 0.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg from supine to the HDT position. LBNP during head-down-tilt significantly lowered IOP to supine levels (difference from supine, 0.3 +/- 1.1 mmHg). In addition, added LBNP during HDT significantly decreased ICP-related pulse amplitudes of transcranial ultrasound waveforms by 2.1+/-3.4 microns (n=9). Mean blood pressure and heart rate did not change significantly across all conditions. Conclusion(s): These data demonstrate that short duration exposures to HDT increase IOP and ICP significantly and further, that LBNP counteracts these elevations of IOP and ICP. Therefore, spaceflight countermeasures that shift fluid to lower body may mitigate vision problems.",Excluded

Background: Ecological studies showing an inverse association between pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality and levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), suggest that higher levels of sun exposure may reduce risks of pancreatic cancer but there has been only one individual-level study that examined this issue. We aimed to examine the association between pancreatic cancer and markers of exposure to solar UVR, namely skin type, treatment of skin lesions, ambient UVR and time outdoors on work days. Method(s): We used data from an Australian case-control study. Location at birth, residential location during adulthood, outdoors work, history of skin lesion treatment and sensitivity of the skin to the sun were obtained by questionnaire. We limited the analyses to Caucasians who answered the questionnaire about UVR (controls = 589/711 recruited; cases = 496/705 recruited). We used NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer to estimate ambient UVR. Result(s): Being born in or living in areas of higher ambient UVR (compared to lower ambient UVR) was associated with about 30-40% lower risk of pancreatic cancer. People with fair skin colour had 47% lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with dark skin colour (95% CI 0.37-0.75). There was some suggestion of increased risk with increased average number of hours spent outside at work. Conclusion(s): This study suggests that people with light skin colour or those born or living in areas of high ambient UVR have lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Our analysis supports an association between UVR and pancreatic cancer, possibly mediated through production of vitamin D. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded

483,"Long-term local control achieved after hypofractionated stereotactic body radiotherapy for adrenal gland metastases: A retrospective analysis of 34 patients. Aims and background. To describe feasibility, tolerability and clinical outcomes of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in the treatment of adrenal metastases in 34 consecutive cancer patients. Material and methods. Between March 2004 and July 2010, a total of 34 consecutive patients, accounting for 36 adrenal metastatic lesions, were treated with SBRT. SBRT treatments were delivered by a Linac Varian 600 with microMLC (3DLine, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden) and a Linac ELEKTA Precise (Elekta). All 34 patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated during and after completion of SBRT. Following outcomes were taken into account: best clinical response at any time, local control, time to systemic progression, time to local progression, overall survival and toxicity. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and factor potentially affecting outcomes were analyzed with Cox regression analysis. Results. Total RT doses ranged from 20 Gy in 4 fractions to 45 Gy in 18 fractions (median dose: 32 Gy; median number of fractions: 4). All doses were prescribed to the 95% isodose line. No cases of Grade >= 3 toxicity were recorded. At a median follow-up time of 41 months (range, 1275) 22 patients were alive. Three of 28 lesions (11%) showed complete response, 13/28 (46%) partial response, 10/28 (36%) stable disease and 2/28 (7%) progressed in the treated area. Local failure was observed in 13 cases. Actuarial local control rates at one and two years were 66% and 32%, respectively. Median time to local progression was 19 months. Median survival was 22 months. Conclusion. SBRT in adrenal gland metastasis is feasible without significant acute and late toxicities, with a good rate of local control. New SBRT fractionation schemes and the possibility to combine new systemic approaches should be investigated in order to further increase local control and reduce systemic disease progression. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded

579,"Core decompression combined with implantation of a demineralised bone matrix for non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Introduction: Core decompression is the standard surgical procedure in the treatment of early stage non-traumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). However, there is still a debate whether decompression in combination with supplementary augmentation by bone grafts, growth factors, or cell implementation is superior to conventional decompression alone. This study evaluated patients after core decompression combined with an augmentation by a demineralised bone matrix, and particularly aimed to report long-term conversion rates to total hip replacement (THR). Material(s) and Method(s): 14 patients with 18 hips suVering from ONFH (Ficat stage I-IIB) underwent this surgical procedure. All patients underwent radiographic and MRI investigations at baseline and at follow-up periods of 12 and 24 months. The clinical follow-up was done using the Merle d'Aubigne-score for an average period of 9 years after surgery. Result(s): 14 of the 18 subjects (77 %) achieved at least a good clinical result after 2 years. The Merle d'Aubignescore improved signiWcantly after 12 (p = 0.0001) and 24 months (p = 0.0002). However, the MRI volumetric analysis showed an increased necrotic bone volume from 3.16 +/- 0.54 to 3.88 +/- 0.62 cm3 (p = 0.04). Within 9 years, 13 out of 18 cases (72 %) required further surgery by THR. Only 7 out of 18 subjects (39 %) reported an ongoing postoperative clinical beneWt, and would retrospectively redo the same surgical approach again. The Wve patients that did not require THR were still satisWed after 9 years. Conclusion(s): In patients with early- stage femoral head osteonecrosis core decompression combined with the implantation of a demineralised bone matrix leads to a limited, temporary pain relief as seen in core decompression alone. However, long-term results were not encouraging with a high rate of conversion to arthroplasty. Therefore, core decompression with implantation of a demineralised bone matrix may be not appropriate to avoid THR in the long term. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Excluded
2597,"Genomic characterization of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in radiation-exposed Chornobyl cleanup workers. Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was the predominant leukemia in a recent study of Chornobyl cleanup workers from Ukraine exposed to radiation (UR-CLL). Radiation risks of CLL significantly increased with increasing bone marrow radiation doses. Current analysis aimed to clarify whether the increased risks were due to radiation or to genetic mutations in the Ukrainian population. Method(s): A detailed characterization of the genomic landscape was performed in a unique sample of 16 UR-CLL patients and age- and sex-matched unexposed general population Ukrainian-CLL (UN-CLL) and Western-CLL (W-CLL) patients (n = 28 and 100, respectively). Result(s): Mutations in telomere-maintenance pathway genes POT1 and ATM were more frequent in UR-CLL compared to UN-CLL and W-CLL (both p < 0.05). No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at del13q14, del11q, del17p or trisomy12 was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. Type of work performed in the Chornobyl zone, age at exposure and at diagnosis, calendar time, and Rai stage were significant predictors of total genetic lesions (all p < 0.05). Tumor telomere length was significantly longer in UR-CLL than in UN-CLL (p = 0.009) and was associated with the POT1 mutation and survival. Conclusion(s): No significant enrichment in copy-number abnormalities at CLL-associated genes was identified in UR-CLL compared to other groups. The novel associations between radiation exposure, telomere maintenance and CLL prognosis identified in this unique case series provide suggestive, though limited data and merit further investigation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
2820,"Clinical outcome of stage III non-small-cell lung cancer patients after definitive radiotherapy. Primarily combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used to treat unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer; however, the results are not satisfactory. In this study treatment results were retrospectively analyzed and the prognostic factors related to survival were identified. From March 1999 to January 2004, 102 patients with stage IIIA/IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer received definitive radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Radiotherapy involved a daily dose of 1.8-2.0 Gy five times a week; 60 Gy was set as the total dose. Maximal chemotherapy was given to patients with normal kidney, liver, and bone marrow functions. The 5-year overall survival rate was 22.2%; the median survival was 18 months. The median follow-up of surviving patients was 53 months. The complete or partial response rate was 85%. At the time of the last follow-up, 21 patients were alive and 81 patients had died, including 5 patients who had died due to radiation pneumonitis. There were significant differences in survival and in the fatal radiation pneumonitis rate between patients with superior lobe lesions and those with middle or inferior lobe lesions. Patients whose primary tumor is located in the superior lobe appear to have a better clinical outcome.",Excluded
207,"Establishing locoregional control of malignant pleural mesothelioma using high-dose radiotherapy and 18F-FDG PET/CT scan correlation. Introduction: The management of malignant pleural mesothelioma represents one of the most challenging issues in oncology, as there is no proven long-term benefit from surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone or in combination. Locoregional progression remains the major cause of death, but radical surgical resection may produce major postoperative morbidity. While radical or postoperative radiotherapy using conventional techniques has resulted in severe toxicity with no impact on survival, recent advances in radiotherapy delivery may be more effective. Method(s): We treated patients with locally advanced mesothelioma whose tumours had been sub optimally resected with high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to large volumes of one hemithorax, using CT and positron emission tomography (PET) scan-based treatment planning. Clinical outcomes were assessed by determining patterns of failure and metabolic changes in total glycolytic volume (TGV) between pre- and post-irradiation18F-FDG PET/CT scans and by recording acute and late toxicity grades. Result(s): Fourteen patients were analysed with 40 PET scans performed before and up to 4.5 years after radiotherapy. Eleven patients had pleurectomy/decortications, one had an extrapleural pneumonectomy and two had no surgery. Four patients who received chemotherapy had all progressed prior to radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, the in-field local control rate was 71%. No progression occurred in two patients, one was salvaged with further radiotherapy to a new site, four recurred inside the irradiated volume all with concurrent distant metastases and the other seven had distant metastases only. The TGVs were reduced by an average of 67% (range 12-100%) after doses of 45 to 60 Gy to part or all of one hemithorax. There were no serious treatment-related toxicities. Median survival was 25 months from diagnosis and 17 months after starting radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): We have established that mesothelioma can be locally controlled with high radiation doses using 3DCRT or IMRT, and that strict normal tissue dose constraints have limited radiation toxicities. Radiotherapy should be considered to prevent or delay the local manifestations of progressive disease in suitable patients after surgery including extrapleural pneumonectomy and pleurectomy/decortication. Higher radiation doses may allow more effective palliation. © 2011 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Excluded
34,"Acute and long-term effects on limb function of combined modality limb sparing therapy for extremity soft tissue sarcoma. A retrospective review is presented on 145 patients who underwent limb-sparing surgery and radiation therapy (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy) for their primary soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities on protocol between 1975 and 1986. The focus on our analysis was the acute and long term toxicity of treatment on limb function. The most common acute complication was skin reaction, occurring in 52 patients (36%). Long term (occurring after more than 1 year following all treatment) treatment complications in the extremity were as follows: bone fracture = 6%; contracture = 20%; pain requiring narcotics = 7%; edema greater than 2+ = 19%; moderate to severe decrease in range of motion = 32%; moderate to severe decrease in manual muscle strength = 20%; orthotic device required = 9%; cane or crutch required = 7%; chronic infection = 9%; and tissue induration = 57%. Three amputations for treatment complications were required. Inclusion of more than 50% of the joint in the radiation portal was associated with a higher frequency of contracture. High nominal standard dose (greater than 1760 rets, greater than 63 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction) resulted in more painful limbs as well as limbs with increased edema, decreased manual muscle strength, decreased range of motion, and skin telangiectasias. Edema was more often noted in patients with a longer radiation portal (greater than 35 cm), as was tissue induration. Chronic ulcer or infection was more frequently seen in patients with lower extremity tumors and when more than 75% of the extremity diameter was irradiated. Although chemotherapy given concurrent with radiation therapy was associated with a higher number of acute skin reactions, this did not appear to translate into increased long term morbidity. The percentage of patients ambulating without assistive devices and with mild or no pain was 84%. Careful attention to the techniques of radiation therapy may have a significant impact on minimizing acute and long term complications of limb sparing treatment for extremity soft tissue sarcoma.",Excluded
1292,"Magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal neoplasms. MRI has been shown to be very useful in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. The lack of ionizing radiation, the superb contrast resolution, and the ability to directly scan the sagittal and coronal planes make MRI a very attractive imaging mode for treatment planning. With spin-echo MRI, maximum contrast between tumor and fatty tissues generally occurs with short TR and TE times (T1-weighted images). Likewise, maximum contrast between tumor and muscle, tendon, or ligaments occurs with long values of TR and TE (T2-weighted images). Early experience suggests that the already exceptional contrast resolution seen with MRI can be improved even more with the administration of intravenous contrast agents. Just as with CT, fatty tumors can usually be easily distinguished from other tissue types with MRI by means of their differential intensity behavior at different pulse sequences. Fluid-filled tumors, such as unicameral bone cysts or aneurysmal bone cysts may be suspected in the same manner, especially if a fluid-fluid level is seen within the lesion. Otherwise, MRI has not been useful so far in noninvasively determining the histologic type of tumors. Our experience and that of others suggests that MRI is equal or superior to CT in the work-up of musculoskeletal neoplasms. This is especially striking when it is remembered that one is comparing an immature MRI technology with a mature CT technology. Although CT presently has a central role in the staging of musculoskeletal tumors, MRI will shortly supplant it in many cases.",Excluded
1387,"Radioprotective properties of detoxified lipid A from Salmonella minnesota R595. In the past, the toxicity of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or its principal bioactive component, lipid A, has detracted from their potential use as radioprotectants. Recently, a relatively nontoxic monophosphoryl Lipid A (LAM) that retains many of the immunobiologic properties of LPS has been isolated from a polysaccharide deficient Re mutant strain of Salmonella minnesota (R595). The ability of the native endotoxic glycolipid (GL) from S. minnesota (R595) as well as diphosphoryl lipid A (LAD) and nontoxic monophosphoryl lipid A (LAM) derived from GL to protect LPS responsive (CD2F1 or C3H/HeN) and nonresponsive (C3H/HeJ) mice from 60Co gamma irradiation has been studied. Administration of GL, LAD, or LAM to CD2F1 or C3H/HeN mice (400 micrograms/kg) 24 h prior to exposure provided significant radioprotection. No protection was afforded to C3H/HeJ mice. Experiments were also conducted to determine the relative abilities of GL, LAD, and LAM to stimulate hematopoiesis as reflected by the endogenous spleen colony (E-CFU) assay. Protection was not correlated with the ability of these substances to increase E-CFUs or to induce colony-stimulating activity (CSA).",Excluded

Purpose: To evaluate the clinical and radiologic response rates, toxicity and tolerability of 2x8 Gy whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases (BM). Method(s): WBRT was delivered to 126 lung cancer patients with BM during 2002-2006. External beam RT was delivered with a fraction dose of 8 Gy on the same day of each consecutive week. Tumor and symptom response and toxicity were recorded at every follow-up. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were used for analysis of overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-three patients had small cell (SCLC) and 103 had non small cell lung cancer. Pretreatment median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 70 (range 20-90). Clinical response rates were as follows: complete 31%; good partial 30.2%; partial 21.4%; stable 7.9%; and progressive 5.6%. Median palliation and survival duration was 57 and 80 days, respectively. Two- and 6-month survival rates (SR) were 59.5% and 25.4%, respectively. According to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 6-month SR for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 61.5, 41.6 and 33.9%, respectively (p=0.002).

The average specific injected FDG activity was equal to 4.3 MBq kg(-1), in agreement with European recommendations. The new 'time-of-flight' technology enabled to decreasing the specific activity down to 3.5 MBq kg(-1). The results have shown that current diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for the diagnostic trunk CT are too high for CT combined with PET, only performed in France for attenuation correction and localisation, and not for diagnostic purpose. Despite wide variations between PET-CT units (4-fold factor in CTDI(vol)), DRLs equal to 8 mGy (CTDI(vol)) and 750 mGy cm (dose-length product) could be proposed for whole-body PET-CT.

OBJECTIVES: Differentiating radiation injury from viable tumor is important for optimizing patient care. Our aim was to directly compare the effectiveness of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion in differentiating radiation effects from tumor growth in patients with increased enhancement following radiotherapy for primary or secondary brain tumors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 12 consecutive patients with primary and secondary brain tumors over a 1-year period that demonstrated indeterminate enhancing lesions after radiotherapy and that had undergone DSC MR perfusion, FDG PET-CT, and subsequent histopathologic diagnosis. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of the lesion (SUVlesion max), SUVratio (SUVlesion max/SUVnormal brain), maximum relative cerebral blood volume, percentage of signal intensity recovery, and relative peak height were calculated from the positron emission tomography and MR perfusion studies. A prediction of tumor or radiation injury was made based on these variables while being blinded to the results of the surgical pathology., RESULTS: SUVratio had the highest predictive value (area under the curve=0.943) for tumor progression, although this was not statistically better than any MR perfusion metric (area under the curve=0.757-0.829)., CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that FDG PET-CT and DSC MR perfusion may demonstrate similar effectiveness for distinguishing tumor growth from radiation injury. Assessment of the SUVratio may increase the sensitivity and specificity of FDG PET-CT for differentiating tumor and radiation injury. Further analysis is needed to help define which modality has greater predictive capabilities. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Method(s): This is a retrospective review of patients with ES-NSCLC treated at our institution using SBRT. Lobar, locoregional, and distant failures were evaluated based on PERCIST/RECIST and clinical course. Univariate analysis of the Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), lobar control (LC), locoregional control (LRC), and distant control (DC) was conducted using the log-rank test. Pre- and post-treatment SUVmax were evaluated using cutoffs of <5 and >=5, <4 and >=4, and <3 and >=3. incrementSUVmax was also evaluated at various cutoffs. Cox regression analysis was conducted to evaluate survival outcomes based on age, gender, pre-treatment gross tumor volume (GTV), longest tumor dimension on imaging, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Result(s): This study included 95 patients (53 female, 42 male), median age 75. Lung SBRT was delivered in 3-5 fractions to a total of 48-60Gy, with a BEDalpha/beta=10Gy of at least 100Gy. Median OS and PFS from the end of SBRT was 15.4 and 11.9months, respectively. On univariate analysis, PERCIST/RECIST response correlated with PFS (p=0.039), LC (p=0.007), and LRC (p=0.015) but not OS (p=0.21) or DC (p=0.94).

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and acute efficacy of real-time 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT3DTEE)guided ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CVTI). Background(s): The use of RT3DTEE to guide a transcatheter radiofrequency ablation procedure has never been systematically investigated. Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with CVTI-dependent atrial flutter underwent CVTI ablation. Procedural monitoring using RT3DTEE was assigned to patients who requested general anesthesia for the procedure (n = 21 [30%]). In the other 49 patients (the control group), the procedures were monitored using the standard fluoroscopic approach. Procedural time was considered as skin-to-skin electrophysiological procedure duration, not including anesthesia preparation; adequate radiofrequency ablation applications (with fixed temperature and power settings) were considered as lesions lasting < 60 s. Result(s): RT3DTEE allowed visualization of the CVTI and identified related structures in most patients (20 of 21); anatomic features such as long CVTI (n = 11), prominent Eustachian ridge (n = 9), prominent Eustachian valve (n = 6), septal recess (n = 8), and pectinate muscles (n = 10) were frequent. Also, RT3DTEE allowed continuous visualization of ablation catheter movement and contact. Compared with the control group, RT3DTEE was equally effective in achieving CVTI bidirectional block (100% in both groups), and no complications occurred. RT3DTEE shortened procedural time (median 73.0 min, interquartile range [IQR] 60.0 to 90.0 min, vs. median 115.0 min, IQR 85.0 to 133.0 min, p < 0.001), reduced radiation exposure (median fluoroscopy time 4.2 min, IQR 3.1 to 8.4 min, vs. median 19.3 min, IQR 12.9 to 36.4 min, p < 0.001; median fluoroscopy dose 575.4 cGy . cm2, IQR 428.5 to 1,299.4 cGy . cm2, vs. median 3,520.7 cGy . cm2, IQR 1,700.0 to 6,709.0 cGy . cm2, p < 0.001), and reduced the number of radiofrequency applications to achieve bidirectional block (median 7, IQR 6 to 10, vs. median 12, IQR 10 to 22, p = 0.007).

Materials and Methods This study included data of 120 patients undergoing clinically indicated chest (n = 68) and abdomen (n = 52) CT. Fifty-two of the patients were scanned with CT using a table height manually selected by technologists; 68 patients were automatically positioned with the 3D camera, which is based on patient-specific body surface and contour detection. The ground truth table height (TGT) was defined as the table height that aligns the axial center of the patient's body region in the CT scanner isocenter. Off-centering was defined as the difference between the ground truth table height (TGT) and the actual table position used in all CT examinations. The t test was performed to determine significant differences in the vertical offset between automatic and manual positioning. The chi2 test was used to check whether there was a relationship between patient size and the magnitude of off-centering. Results We found a significant improvement in patient centering (offset 5 +/- 3 mm) when using the automatic positioning algorithm with the 3D camera compared with manual positioning (offset 19 +/- 10 mm) performed by technologists (P < 0.005). Automatic patient positioning based on the 3D camera reduced the average offset in vertical table position from 19 mm to 7 mm for chest and from 18 mm to 4 mm for abdomen CT. The absolute maximal offset was 39 mm and 43 mm for chest and abdomen CT, respectively, when patients were positioned manually, whereas with automatic positioning using the 3D camera the offset never exceeded 15 mm. In chest CT performed with manual patient positioning, we found a significant correlation between vertical offset greater than 20 mm and patient size (body mass index, >26 kg/m2, P < 0.001). In contrast, no such relationship was found for abdomen CT (P = 0.38). Conclusions Automatic individualized patient positioning using a 3D camera allows for accurate patient centering as compared with manual positioning, which improves radiation dose utilization.Copyright © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

92,"Phase I trial of concurrent hyperfractionated split course radiotherapy (HFx RT), cisplatin (cDDP), and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated, or treatment-naive locally advanced upper aerodigestive malignancy. Purpose: Phase I study to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of cisplatin (cDDP), paclitaxel (P), and concurrent split course hyperfractionated (BID) RT in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and other upper aerodigestive tumors. Material(s) and Method(s): Eligibility stipulated ECOG performance status 0-2 and either Tx-naive, locally advanced, or locally recurrent, previously radiated, surgically unresectable upper aerodigestive cancer. Metastases were permitted if disease was predominantly locoregional. RT-naive patients received 150 cGy bid x 5 d Q 2 wks x 4. Previously radiated patients received 150 cGy bid x 5, wk 1; then 120 cGy bid x 5 Q 2 wk x 3 (later increased to 150 cGy BID for the entire treatment). Treatment fields included recurrent tumor only with 2 cm margins. Whenever possible, conventional and 3-D conformal techniques were used. Elective nodal radiation was not administered. Starting doses of cDDP and P were 12 mg/m 2/d x 5 and 15 mg/m2/d x 5, respectively, Q 2 wk x 4, each given on RT days only. At dose level 2, cDDP was increased to 15 mg/m 2/d x 5. At dose level 3, P was increased to 20 mg/m2/d x 5. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) days 6-12 (off treatment week) was added if cumulative neutropenia precipitated treatment delays. Result(s): Thirty-one patients (21 men, 10 women) were treated. Eight had received prior chemotherapy, 27 prior RT. At dose level three, regular treatment delays of >=1 week due to slow neutrophil recovery occurred. Addition of G-CSF (dose level 3b) reduced treatment delays from 100 percent to 28 percent and decreased the incidence of Grade >=2 neutropenia and mucositis. Six of 7 patients at this dose level completed all 4 cycles of treatment and all received full dose RT (60 Gy). No other dose-limiting toxicities occurred. Of 22 assessable patients with locally recurrent SCCHN, 12 (55 percent) responded. Median time to progression in this group was 6 months, with median and one-year survival of 9.5 mos and 41 percent, respectively. Conclusion(s): Concurrent daily cisplatin/paclitaxel and split course hyperfractionated RT (60 Gy) is feasible in previously radiated patients. G-CSF, administered between each cycle, reduces the incidence of treatment delays. Activity is promising and toxicity acceptable. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Excluded

446,"Safety and efficacy of thoracic external beam radiotherapy after airway stenting in malignant airway obstruction. Purpose: We retrospectively evaluated the outcome and toxicity of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) after airway stents were placed in patients treated for malignant airway obstruction. Methods and Materials: Between 2004 and 2009, we performed airway stenting followed by EBRT in 43 patients for symptomatic primary lung cancer (n = 31) or other thoracic malignancies (n = 12). The median time interval between stent placement and first irradiation was 14 days. A median total dose of 50 Gy was delivered. Sixty-seven percent of the patients had reduced performance status (Karnofsky performance score, <=70). Result(s): EBRT had to be stopped prematurely in 16 patients (37%), at a median total dose of 17 Gy, for various reasons. In this group of patients, the survival was poor, with a median overall survival (OS) of only 21 days. Twenty-seven patients (63%) completed radiotherapy as planned, with a median OS of 8.4 months. Fourteen of 43 patients (33%) developed at least one Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event of grade 3 to 5. The most common event was a malignant restenosis of the stent leading to asphyxia (n = 7), followed by fistula formation (n = 4), necrosis (n = 3), mediastinitis with abscess (n = 1), secondary nonmalignant airway stenosis (n = 1), and hemoptysis (n = 1). With the exception of one event, all events were associated with a local progression of the tumor. Conclusion(s): Although the long-term prognosis for patients with malignant airway obstruction is poor, airway stenting combined with EBRT offers a possible therapeutic option, achieving fast relief of acute respiratory distress with an associated antitumor effect, resulting in a potential survival benefit. However, due to local advanced tumor growth, increased rates of adverse events are to be expected, necessitating careful monitoring. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2700,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety. Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC.

320,"Muscle injury following experimental intraoperative irradiation. The paraaortic region of beagle dogs was irradiated to 15 to 55 Gy intraoperative irradiation, 10 to 47.5 Gy intraoperative irradiation following 50 Gy external beam irradiation in 25 fractions, or 50 to 80 Gy external beam irradiation in 30 fractions. Six MeV electrons were used for intraoperative irradiation, and external beam irradiation was done using photons from a 6 MV linear accelerator. The psoas muscle in the irradiation field was examined histomorphometrically 2 or 5 years after irradiation. The percentage of muscle fibers and capillaries decreased, whereas the percentage of connective tissue increased with increased dose for both intraoperative irradiation only and intraoperative irradiation plus external beam irradiation. The dose causing a 50% decrease in the percentage of muscle fibers was 21.2 Gy and 33.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone, and 22.9 Gy and 25.2 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. The ED50 for severe vessel lesions was 19.2 Gy and 25.8 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation alone and 16.0 Gy and 18.0 Gy at 2 and 5 years, respectively, after intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation. External beam irradiation alone caused a slight decrease in percentage of muscle fibers with increased dose, and vessel lesions were infrequent or mild. Radiation-induced muscle injury was characterized by loss of muscle fibers, decreased fiber size, severe vessel lesions, hemorrhage, inflammation, coagulation necrosis, and fibrosis. These histopathologic characteristics distinguish this muscle injury from that caused by neurogenic atrophy. These data indicate that radiation-induced muscle injury most likely was caused by injury of the supporting vasculature. The lesions produced were largely a function of the single intraoperative dose rather than the external beam fractionated doses. Furthermore, it appears that 20 to 25 Gy intraoperative irradiation combined with 50 Gy external beam irradiation may be near the maximum tolerated dose by sublumbar musculature and its supporting vasculature.",Excluded
691,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

3488,"Are low ultraviolet B and vitamin D associated with higher incidence of multiple myeloma?. Background The purpose of this study was to determine whether an inverse association exists between latitude, solar ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiance, and incidence rates of multiple myeloma.Methods Associations of latitude and UVB irradiance with age-standardized incidence rates of multiple myeloma were analyzed for 175 countries while controlling for sex-specific obesity prevalence, cigarette consumption, and alcohol consumption using multiple linear regression.Results Incidence rates of multiple myeloma were greater at higher latitudes (R2 for latitude for males = 0.31, p < 0.0001; females R2 = 0.27, p < 0.0001). In regression models for males (R2 = 0.62, p < 0.0001) and females (R2 = 0.51, p < 0.0001), UVB irradiance was independently inversely associated with incidence rates.Conclusions Age-adjusted incidence rates of multiple myeloma were higher in countries with lower solar UVB irradiance.

1564,"Characteristics, sources and health risk assessment of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities: A review. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds composed of at least two benzene rings. This paper reviews the characteristics, sources and health risk of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities. The airborne particulate PAH concentrations varied from 3.35 to 910ngm-3, with an average of 75.0ngm-3, and the pollution level of PAHs in northern cities was generally higher than that in southern cities. The PAH concentrations in different cities underwent similar seasonal variations, with high concentrations in the winter and relatively low concentrations in the summer. Many factors, such as meteorological conditions and source emissions, influenced the spatiotemporal pattern of PAHs. High temperatures, frequent flow exchanges, abundant rainfall and strong solar radiation reduced the level of particulate PAHs in the atmosphere. The historical changes in the level of airborne particulate PAHs in four cities were analyzed. The PAH concentrations in Beijing and Taiyuan presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the level of particulate PAHs in Nanjing and Guangzhou had a decreasing tendency from year 2000-2015. The airborne particulate PAHs in cities were derived from several sources, including coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coking industries, biomass burning and petroleum volatilization. The results of a health risk assessment indicated that the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people in the northern cities was higher than that for people in the other regions, especially during the cold season. Moreover, adults were at greater risk than people in other age groups, and the health risk to females was slightly higher than that to males. The potential risk of airborne particulate PAH exposure was relatively high in some cities, and controlling PAH emissions at the source should be required to prevent pollution.

PURPOSE: To compare the demarcation line depth after 2 different protocols of simultaneous laser in situ keratomileusis and collagen crosslinking (LASIK Xtra)., METHODS: Twenty-three patients receiving bilateral LASIK Xtra were included in this comparative interventional study. The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded

Data on the influence of rhenium-188 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (188Re-HEDP), rhenium-186 hydroxyethylidene diphosphonate (186Re-HEDP), and strontium-89 (89Sr) on pain symptoms, quality of life, and bone-marrow function were obtained in 64 patients with breast and prostate cancer. Thirty-one patients were treated with 188Re-HEDP (3194 +/- 387 MBq), 15 patients with 186Re-HEDP (1358 +/- 158 MBq), and 18 patients with 89Sr (152 +/- 19 MBq). The 188Re-HEDP group included six breast cancer patients and 25 prostate cancer patients; the 186Re-HEDP group included three breast cancer patients and 12 prostate cancer patients; and the 89Sr group included three breast cancer patients and 15 prostate cancer patients. All subjects participated in an interview using a standardized sets of questions before and after the 12-week term of therapy. Blood counts were taken weekly for six weeks and after 12 weeks. Results showed that 77 percent of patients reported pain relief after treatment with 188Re-HEDP, 67 percent after treatment with 186Re-HEDP, and 72 percent after treatment with 89Sr. Sixteen percent of patients treated with 188Re-HEDP, 13 percent treated with 186Re-HEDP, and 17 percent treated with 89Sr were able to discontinue their analgesics and were pain-free. Patients described an improvement on Karnofsky performance status (KPS) from 73 +/- 7 percent to 85 +/- 8 percent 12 weeks after 188Re-HEDP (p < 0. 05), from 72 +/- 13 percent to 79 +/- 12 percent after 186Re-HEDP (p = 0.251), and from 62 +/- 14 percent to 69 +/- 16 percent after 89Sr (p = 0.415). Only three patients undergoing 188Re-HEDP therapy, one undergoing 186Re-HEDP therapy, and three undergoing 89Sr therapy had thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 100 x 10(3)/microl) following treatment. The maximum nadir of platelet and leukocyte counts was observed between the second and fifth week after treatment for all radionuclides and was reversible within 12 weeks. The nadir was earlier for 188Re-HEDP with a shorter physical half-life compared with 89Sr. There were no significant differences in bone marrow toxicity (p = 0.123-0.421). Results of this study indicate that all evaluated radiopharmaceuticals were effective in pain palliation without induction of severe side effects. The increase in KPS after 188Re-HEDP was the only statistically significant finding (p = 0.001).",Excluded

1807,"Subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal retinal thickness during head-down tilt. Introduction: To reveal subtle morphological changes in the eye during simulated microgravity for spaceflights, we measured subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal retinal thickness during 10degree head-down tilt (HDT). We hypothesized that elevated ophthalmic vein pressure during simulated microgravity increases subfoveal choroidal thickness via enlargement of the choroidal vasculature and greater choroidal blood volume. Method(s): The right eyes of nine healthy subjects (seven men, two women) were examined. Subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal retinal thickness were measured using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography in the sitting position, and after 15 and 30 min of 10degree HDT. Intraocular pressure was also measured. Result(s): Mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (+/- SEM) increased from 300 +/- 31 mum in the sitting position to 315 +/- 31 mum with 15-min HDT, and 333 +/- 31 mum with 30-min HDT. However, no change in foveal retinal thickness was observed (228 +/- 9 mum in the sitting position, 228 +/- 10 mum with 15-min HDT and 228 +/- 9 mum with 30-min HDT). Intraocular pressure increased from 14 +/- 1 mmHg in the sitting position to 21 +/- 2 mmHg with 30-min HDT (54 +/- 6%, N = 5).

Objective: To assess radiation dose and image quality in body CT-angiography (CTA) with automated attenuation-based tube voltage selection (ATVS) on a 192-slice dual-source CT (DSCT). Method(s): Forty patients (69.5 +/- 9.6 years) who had undergone body CTA with ATVS (ref.kVp 100, ref.mAs 90) using a 2x192-slice CT in single-source mode were retrospectively included. All patients had undergone prior CTA with a 2x128-slice CT and ATVS with identical imaging and contrast media protocols, serving for comparison. Images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction at similar strength levels. Radiation dose was determined. Image quality was assessed semi-quantitatively (1:excellent, 5:non-diagnostic), aortic attenuation, noise and CNR were determined. Result(s): As compared to 128-slice DSCT, 192-slice DSCT selected tube voltages were lower in 30 patients (75 %), higher in 3 (7.5 %), and similar in 7 patients (17.5 %). CTDIvol was lower with 192-slice DSCT (4.7 +/- 1.9 mGy vs. 5.8 +/- 2.1 mGy; p < 0.001). Subjective image quality, mean aortic attenuation (342 +/- 67HU vs. 268 +/- 67HU) and CNR (9.8 +/- 2.5 vs. 8.2 +/- 2.9) were higher with 192-slice DSCT (all p < 0.01), all datasets being diagnostic. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that ATVS of 192-slice DSCT for body CTA is associated with an improved image quality and further radiation dose reduction of 19 % compared to 128-slice DSCT. Key Points: * 192-slice DSCT allows imaging from 70 kVp to 150 kVp at 10 kVp increments. * 192-slice DSCT allows for radiation-dose reduction in body-CTA with ATVS. * Subjective and objective image quality increase compared to 128-slice DSCT.Copyright © 2015, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded

2050,"NASA's space Launch System: Payload opportunities for lunar exploration, science missions. Nearing its first launch, the Space Launch System (SLS), NASA's new super heavy-lift launch vehicle, offers highly energetic launches that deliver more mass and provide more volume in 8.4 m-diameter and potentially larger fairings to make a new generation of deep space missions possible. An evolvable launcher available in crew, crew with a co-manifested payload (CPL) and cargo-only configurations, SLS is a crucial capability to enable astronauts to return to the Moon, but it also offers key benefits for science missions. NASA's 21st-century return to the Moon recently received a formal name: the Artemis program. In addition to the core enabling capabilities of SLS and the Orion crew spacecraft, NASA will also enlist international and commercial partnerships for Artemis. The Agency intends to build a scientific outpost in lunar orbit, the Gateway, from which human and robotic missions to and from the surface can rendezvous. SLS will launch Orion on a series of missions leading to landing the first woman and the next man on the Moon as part of Artemis. SLS uses proven propulsion systems: two solid rocket boosters and four RS-25s engines that have been upgraded to provide more thrust and operate in the SLS environment. SLS Block 1 uses a modified Delta IV Heavy upper stage, called the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) and lifts at least 26 metric tons (t) to trans-lunar injection (TLI). The Block 1 vehicle can also be outfitted with a 5 m-diameter fairing. Block 1B, the next major variant, also uses solid rocket boosters and RS-25 engines to achieve Earth escape velocity, but replaces the single-engine liquid hydrogen (LH2)/liquid oxygen (LOX) ICPS with a four-engine LH2/LOX Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) to increase mass to TLI to 34-37 t, depending on crew or cargo configuration. In the Block 1B crew configuration, a 10 m-tall Universal Stage Adapter (USA) connects the vehicle to Orion and can carry a CPL up to 10 t. The USA provides 286 m3 of unpressurized volume for payloads. For large payloads, 8.4 m- and 10 m-diameter cargo fairings in 19.1 m and 27.4 m lengths are possible. The ultimate SLS vehicle, Block 2, incorporates evolved boosters to reach a lift capacity of more than 45 t to TLI. The capabilities of SLS not only make new missions to the Moon possible, but also game-changing science missions, such as deployment of large-aperture space telescopes, spacecraft to the ice giants or even probes to the interstellar medium. This paper will discuss the capabilities of SLS, the vehicle's planned evolution, missions that can effectively utilize the vehicle and manufacturing status of the vehicle.

430,"Is there need for radioimmunotherapy? results of a phase I/II study in patients with indolent B-cell lymphomas using lutetium-177-DOTA-rituximab. AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the clinical response to 177Lutetium-DOTA-rituximab (177Lu-D-R) and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in the treatment of patients with relapsed follicular, mantle cell or other indolent lymphomas such as marginal zone lymphoma as well as to put these results into context with other therapy options for these patients., METHODS: Treatment consisted of cold rituximab (250 mg/m2) on day 1 and day 8 and 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab on day 8. Reassessment was done at week 10. Thirty-one patients (males=17, females=14, median number of pretreatments: 3) were treated in seven cohorts. Escalation of injected activity was carried out in steps of 5 mCi/m2. Dosimetry was performed in the first 20 patients., RESULTS: The MTD was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were the dose-limiting toxicities. Significant anemia only occurred at dose level 7. We observed the nadir of platelets after a median of 36 days from treatment with 177Lu-D-R and a nadir of granulocytes after a median of 50 days from 177Lu-D-R treatment. Non-hematological toxicity was negligible. We observed clinical responses at all dose levels and for all lymphoma entities. Some of the responses were durable; the longest follow up in complete remission is currently over eight years., CONCLUSION: The MTD of 177Lu-DOTA-Rituximab was found to be 45 mCi/m2. Non hematologic toxicity was negligible. Responses were seen in all lymphoma entities and at all dose levels tested. Further testing seems to be most promising mainly in follicular and marginal zone lymphoma in particular as the results compare well to other therapy options for these patients with regard to effectiveness, toxicity and discomfort for the patients.",Excluded
111,"Fasciculation-myokymic activity and prolonged nerve conduction block. A physiopathological relationship in radiation-induced brachial plexopathy. Fourteen radiation-induced brachial plexus neuropathies in 12 patients suffering from cancer were studied. Neurophysiological evaluation showed a diffuse neurogenic lesion with muscular denervation signs associated with motor and sensory nerve conduction impairment of axonal type in the distal segments of the arm. Somatosensory evoked potentials were frequently abnormal, with absence of N9 in 9 out of the 10 extremities explored. The most characteristic findings were, however, the presence of fasciculation potentials--single and grouped--and myokymic discharges in 78.5% of cases (11 out of 14 plexuses), and a motor nerve conduction block on proximal stimulation, at the supraclavicular as well as cervical spine levels, in all of the cases. Both phenomena showed a high correlation when analyzed in the same neuromuscular territory. The 5 muscles with no voluntary activity and complete--or nearly complete--motor nerve conduction block were the ones with the most intense ectopic activities. The conduction blocks were present after long periods of illness in all cases and, in 2 of the cases, they persisted in successive explorations at intervals of 9 months and 2 years respectively. These data would support a probable cause-effect relationship between a persistent and prolonged motor nerve conduction block and the presence of fasciculation-myokymic type activities. One could even postulate that the infrequent neuropathies, in which both findings have been described as relevant features, have a similar physiopathological mechanism.",Excluded
238,"Integrating Salvage Hypofractionated Radiosurgery with Low-Dose Adjuvant VEGF for Locally Recurrent Brain Metastasis with High-Dose Irradiation Previously. Purpose/Objective(s): Selection of the appropriate treatment for recurrent brain metastasis remains uncertain. Recent studies have demonstrated a significant response rate and acceptable toxicity with the use of fractionated stereotactic radiosurgery (FSRS) in locally recurrent glioblastoma and large brain metastasis patients due to high ""therapeutic ratio"" (ratio of tumor cell killing to normal tissue toxicity).However, radiation necrosis (RN) is a severe complication associated with salvage re-irradiation. RN may be treated with bevacizumab, which blocks the effects of vascular endothelial growth factor in leakage-prone capillaries. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of FSRS combined with the early use of low-dose bevacizumab as a new salvage treatment scheme for locally recurrent brain metastases with high dose irradiation. Materials/Methods: Patients with locally recurrent intracranial metastasis previously treated with SRS or WBRT with SRS were enrolled in this prospective study. The salvage FSRS dose ranged from 9.5to 29 Gy in two to five sessions with 62-75% isodoseline by robotic radiosurgery according to the brain tumor volume, site, and previous irradiation dose. Bevacizumab was prescribed to all patients within 24 hours after completion of the treatment for four cycles (5 mg/kg, 3-week intervals).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), adverse events, and associated clinical outcomes were recorded. The primary objective of this study was to identify the overall survival after salvage treatment. Secondary objectives included clinical response (KPS), imaging response (MRI), and treatment-related adverse events. Result(s): From December 2009 to October 2016, a total of 24 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, 9 received WBRT followed by SRS, and 15 underwent SRS. The median 1-year overall survival (OS) after salvage SRS was 87.5%. Twenty-three (96%) patients had a positive imaging response within a range of 6 to 22 cm3 (median 14 cm3, p= 0.032, paired t-test). Significant clinical improvement was achieved (p<0.05, best KPS, paired t-test). Grade 1/2 fatigue was observed in 8 (33%) patients. Other grade 1 or 2 toxicities included headache, hypertension, and nausea. Grade 3 fatigue and headache occurred in 1 patient. No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): Salvage FSRS with early use of low dose adjuvant bevacizumab treatment showed favorable clinical and radiologic control with manageable toxicity for locally recurrent brain metastasis patients who underwent high dose irradiation previously. The diagnosis of RN and LR after salvage FSRS merit further study.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

85,"The Artemis Program: An Overview of NASA's Activities to Return Humans to the Moon. NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars. 2020 IEEE.",Excluded
2958,"Diffusion tensor imaging in the assessment of normal-appearing brain tissue damage in relapsing neuromyelitis optica. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Normal-appearing brain tissue (NABT) damage was established in multiple sclerosis by histology, MR spectroscopy, magnetization transfer imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, whether this phenomenon can be detected in relapsing neuromyelitis optica (RNMO) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to use DTI to investigate the presence of NABT damage in RNMO patients and its possible mechanism.
METHODS: Conventional MR imaging and DTI scans were performed in 16 patients with RNMO without visible lesions on brain MR imaging and in 16 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects. Histogram analysis of mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed in the entire brain tissue (BT), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM). Region of interest (ROI) analysis of MD and FA was also performed in WM regions connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve (including medulla oblongata, cerebral peduncle, internal capsule, and optic radiation), in corpus callosum without direct connection with them, and in some GM regions.
RESULTS: From histogram analysis, we found the RNMO group had a higher average MD of the BT, WM, and GM, a lower average MD peak height and a higher average MD peak location of the GM, and a higher average FA peak height of the WM than did the control group. From ROI analysis, compared with control subjects, RNMO patients had a higher average MD and a lower average FA in ROIs of WM connected with the spinal white matter tracts or optic nerve and a normal average MD and FA in corpus callosum without direct connection with them. In addition, a high average MD was found in parietal GM in these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the presence of abnormal diffusion in brain tissue in patients with RNMO and suggest that secondary degeneration caused by lesions in the spinal cord and optic nerve might be an important mechanism for this abnormality.",Excluded
3669,"Long-term effects of microgravity on the swimming behaviour of young rats. The postnatal development of sensory systems has been shown in studies over the last four decades to be influenced by experience during critical periods of development. We report here that similar experience-dependent development can be observed in the swimming behaviour of young rats reared from postnatal day 14 (P14) to P30 in the reduced gravitational field of low earth orbit. Animals flown in space when placed in the water on the day of landing maintained their head and forelimbs in a balanced posture. However, until the animals began to swim, their hindquarters showed little lateral postural control resulting in rotation about the longitudinal axis (60 degrees+/-4 deg). Such results suggest an 'unlinking' of postural control of the forequarters from the hindquarters in the early hours after landing. Similar instability seen in animals age-matched to the day of launch (97+/-7 deg) and in ground control animals (9+/-3 deg) was corrected within one or two rotations, even in the absence of swimming. Animals flown in space began to swim sooner after being placed in the water, and the duration of swimming strokes was shorter than in control animals. Motion analysis revealed a difference in the swimming style on landing day. In flight animals, the knee joint was more flexed throughout the stroke, there was a narrower range of movement, and the linear velocity of the tip of the foot was faster throughout most of the stroke than in age-matched control animals. Thus, posture in the water as well as swimming speed and style were altered in the animals flown in space. Some of these characteristics persisted for as long as the animals were followed (30 days). These included the short pre-swimming interval and short stroke duration in flight animals. These findings clearly show that an altered gravitational field influences the postnatal development of motor function. The nature of the differences between animals reared in space for 16 days and those remaining on the ground reflects an adaptation of the flight animals to the microgravity environment. The data suggest that the most fundamental of these adaptations is a resetting of the basic motor rhythm to a higher frequency.",Excluded
1702,"Properties and evolutionary potential of newly induced tandem duplications in Drosophila melanogaster. Most of some 33 X-ray-induced duplications recovered as Suppressors of Minute loci proved to be direct tandem duplications. When heterozygous, most duplications were crossover suppressors, and duplications of short to moderate size did not reduce the fitness of their bearers. Crossover suppression by tandem duplication may be attributed to intrastrand foldbacks of the type regularly seen in somatic polytene chromosomes. As a consequence, linkage disequilibrium between duplicated elements and normal chromosomes should be more profound than has been supposed. Tandem duplications appear to be predisposed by reason of frequency of generation, crossover suppression and fitness effects to serve as the primary source of new genes.",Excluded
3518,"PET/CT in malignant melanoma: a two-tiered healthcare system? Updated healthcare situation regarding initial staging of malignant melanoma with PET/CT. Background: Patients with stage IIC malignant melanoma are recommended to undergo cross-sectional imaging for initial staging. PET/CT is superior to other methods regarding its diagnostic accuracy of the tumor spread in stage III. So far there is no meaningful data on the nationwide availability, usage and cost recovery of this imaging technique. Patients and Methods: Questionnaires on the healthcare situation in 2018 were sent to all German dermatology clinics and PET/CT centers in March and April 2019. Result(s): 61.2 % of the dermatology clinics (71/115) and 48.2 % of the PET/CT centers (77/160) took part in the survey. A total of 22,645 patients with malignant melanoma were seen in these clinics in 2018. 16.8 % of the patients with stage IIC melanoma received a PET/CT for primary staging. The costs of this examination were covered for all statutory and privately insured patients in 40 % and 68 % of dermatology clinics (20/50 and 34/50), respectively. 68.0 % (34/50) of all dermatology clinics reported relevant changes of treatment according to PET/CT findings. Long examination periods by the health insurance companies and the time required to submit the application were the most common reasons for dermatology clinics to reject a request for PET/CT. Relevant incidental findings were reported in 90.2 % (47/51) of all PET/CT centers. Conclusion(s): There are clear differences in the nationwide availability and cost coverage of PET/CT in primary staging for stage IIC melanoma. For these reasons, a two-tiered healthcare system may be assumed.Copyright © 2021 Deutsche Dermatologische Gesellschaft (DDG). Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
3285,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for post-pulmonary lobectomy isolated lung metastasis of thoracic tumor: Survival and side effects. Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic pulmonary tumors. However, for isolated lung metastasis (ILM) of thoracic malignances after pulmonary lobectomy, reported outcomes of SBRT have been limited. This study evaluates the role of SBRT in the treatment of such patients. Method(s): A retrospective search of the SBRT database was conducted in three hospitals. The parameters analyzed in the treated patients were local control, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the treatment-related side-effects. Result(s): In total, 23 patients with single ILM after pulmonary lobectomy treated with SBRT were identified and the median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 6.0-47.0 months). Local recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up and the 1-year local control rate was 91.3%. Median PFS and OS for the studied cohort were 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-14.9 months] and 21.0 months (95% CI 11.4-30.6 months), respectively. Acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) of grade 2 or worse was observed in five (21.7%) and three (13.0%) patients, respectively. Other treatment-related toxicities included chest wall pain in one patient (4.3%) and acute esophagitis in two patients (8.7%). By Pearson correlation analysis, the planning target volume (PTV) volume and the volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to a minimum dose of 5 Gy (IpV5) were significantly related to the acute RP of grade 2 or worse in present study (p < 0.05). The optimal thresholds of the PTV and IpV5 to predict RP of acute grade 2 or worse RP were 59 cm3 and 51% respectively, according to the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, with sensitivity/specificity of 75.0%/80.0% and 62.5%/80.0%. Conclusion(s): SBRT for post-lobectomy ILM was effective and well tolerated. The major reason for disease progression was distant failure but not local recurrence. The PTV and IpV5 are potential predictors of acute RP of grade 2 or higher and should be considered in treatment planning for such patients.Copyright © 2014 Xiong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Two experienced observers independently evaluated coronary CTA datasets from 50 consecutive patients undergoing two 128-slice dual source CT scans within 12 days. Mean (+/-SD) estimated radiation exposure was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv per scan. Observers recorded the presence and characterization of coronary plaques as non-calcified or calcified. A segment involvement score"" (SIS) was computed by summing the numbers of segments with any coronary plaque per patient. Reproducibility was assessed using kappa (kappa) statistics, paired t test and Bland-Altman analyses. Interscan, interobserver, and intraobserver agreement (kappa-values) for detection of any or calcified plaques were 83-94% (kappa-values 0.57-0.85), and 67-84% (0.31-0.67) for non-calcified plaques on a patient level. No significant difference was observed in mean interscan or interobserver SIS. Mean (95% CI) intraobserver SIS difference was -0.88 (-1.25; -0.51), P < 0.001, with limits of agreement from -4.7 to 2.9.

1429,"Radioembolization of hepatocarcinoma with 90Y glass microspheres: treatment optimization using the dose-toxicity relationship. Aim: Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is, by all standards, a radiation therapy. As such, according to Euratom Directive 2013/59, it should be optimized by a thorough treatment plan based on the distinct evaluation of absorbed dose to the lesions and to the non-tumoural liver (two-compartment dosimetry). Since the dosimetric prediction with 99mTc albumin macro-aggregates (MAA) of non-tumoural liver is much more accurate than the same prediction on lesions, treatment planning should focus on non-tumoural liver rather than on lesion dosimetry. The aim of this study was to determine a safety limit through the analysis of pre-treatment dosimetry with 99mTc-MAA single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT), in order to deliver the maximum tolerable absorbed dose to non-tumoural liver. Method(s): Data from intermediate/advanced hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated with 90Y glass microspheres were collected in this single-arm retrospective study. Injection was always lobar, even in case of bilobar disease, to avoid treating the whole liver in a single session. A three-level definition of liver decompensation (LD) was introduced, considering toxicity only in cases of liver decompensation requiring medical action (LD type C, LDC). We report LDC rates, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis between LDC and NO LDC absorbed dose distributions, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) curves and uni- and multivariate analysis of risk factors associated with toxicity. Result(s): A 6-month timeline was defined as necessary to capture all treatment-related toxicity events. Previous transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), presence or extension of portal vein tumoural thrombosis (PVTT) and tumour pattern (nodular versus infiltrative) were not associated with tolerance to TARE. On the contrary, at the multivariate analysis, the absorbed dose averaged over the whole non-tumoural liver (including the non-injected lobe) was a prognostic indicator correlated with liver decompensation (odds ratio = 4.24). Basal bilirubin > 1.1 mg/dL was a second even more significant risk factor (odds ratio = 6.35). NTCP analysis stratified with this bilirubin cut-off determined a 15% liver decompensation risk at 50 Gy/90 Gy for bilirubin >/< 1.1 mg/dL. These results are valid for a 90Y glass microsphere administration 4 days after the reference time. Conclusion(s): Given the low predictive accuracy of 99mTc-MAA on lesion absorbed dose reported by several authors, an optimized TARE with 90Y glass microspheres with lobar injection 4 days after reference time should aim at an absorbed dose averaged over the whole non-tumoural liver of 50 Gy/90 Gy for basal bilirubin higher/lower than 1.1 mg/dL, respectively.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
415,"Characterization of haustral activity in the human colon. Contraction patterns of the human colon are rarely discussed from the perspective of its haustra. Colonic motility was analyzed in 21 healthy subjects using 84-sensor manometry catheters with 1-cm sensor spacing. Capsule endoscopy and manometry showed evidence of narrow rhythmic circular muscle contractions. X-ray images of haustra and sensor locations allowed us to identify manometry motor activity as intrahaustral activity. Two common motor patterns were observed that we infer to be associated with individual haustra: rhythmic pressure activity confined to a single sensor, and activity confined to a section of the colon of 3-6 cm length. Intrahaustral activity was observed by 3-4 sensors. Approximately 50% of the haustra were intermittently active for -30% of the time; 2,402 periods of haustral activity were analyzed. Intrahaustral activity showed rhythmic pressure waves, propagating in mixed direction, 5-30 mmHg in amplitude at a frequency of -3 cpm (range 2-6) or -12 cpm (range 7-15), or exhibiting a checkerboard segmentation pattern. Boundaries of the haustra showed rhythmic pressure activity with or without elevated baseline pressure. Active haustra often showed no boundary activity probably allowing transit to neighboring haustra. Haustral boundaries were seen at the same sensor for the 6- to 8-h study duration, indicating that they did not propagate, thereby likely contributing to continence. The present study elucidates the motility characteristics of haustral boundaries and the nature of intrahaustral motor patterns and paves the way for investigating their possible role in pathophysiology of defecation disorders.Copyright © 2021 the American Physiological Society",Excluded
2045,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study. Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation.

1085,"Pyelotransverse pyelocolostomy: an alternative method for high urinary diversion in patients with extended bilateral ureter damage. After previous radiation due to pelvic malignoma or after multiple operations, the ileal conduit as well as sigmoid conduit are associated with an increased rate of complications. In these patients, the middle and distal ureter often cannot be considered for reimplantation due to fibrosis. High anastomosis to a bowel segment which is undamaged proves favorable. The transverse colon, conveniently situated in the cranial abdomen, is close enough to the kidneys for such a high anastomosis and is mostly spared from irradiation. In cases where severely damaged ureters forbid connection to a normal transverse conduit, we performed a pyelotransverse pyelocolostomy with high anastomosis of the bowel to both renal pelves or ureteropelvic junctions. 7 patients have been treated in this way and the follow-up of these patients ranges between 14 and 24 months. Postoperatively increased renal function was found in 6 renal units, stable function in 6 renal units, and only 1 patient showed a functional ureteropelvic stenosis. 4 months after the operation 1 patient died of sepsis caused by recurrent urinary tract infections due to recurrent stone disease as a consequence of immobilization in myelomeningocele.

Purpose(s):We intended to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of low dose radiation protocols compared to current conventional dose protocols in the patients during diagnostic coronary angiography. Method(s): From February 2015 to October 2015, one hundred three consecutive patients (66.2+/-12.3 years old, 46 women (44.7%) who undertook diagnostic coronary angiography using Artis zeeTM angiography system were enrolled. After randomization of low- or conventional radiation dose protocols (LDP versus CDP), The patient underwent coronary angiography according to the standard angiography method (AP-Caudal, RAO-caudal, RAO-cranial, and LAO-cranial views of each 30 degrees, and spider view of 50 degrees and 30 degrees). The LDP consists of 10 frame rate (FR) per second during fluoroscopy and 40% reduced dose of conventional dose during cineangiography. The radial approach was used in all the procedures. We analyzed and compared the dose-area product (DAP: muGy m2), air-kerma (AK: mGy), exposure time (seconds), and FR between the LDP and CDP group. Result(s): Firstly, there is no significant interference to evaluate the coronary artery status by eyeball estimation between both groups. There are no significant basic demographics between the groups including age, body mass index or waist circumferences. Body weight is well correlated with the level of DAP and AK (gamma=0.27, p=0.006 and gamma=0.29, p=0.008 respectively). Marvelously, there are markedly reduction of effective radiation dose in the LDP group compared to CDP group (DAP, 1087.8+/-612.5 vs. 2188.2+/-949.4 muGy m2; AK, 171.5+/-111.6 vs. 348.1+/-178.3 mGy, p<0.001) by Mann-Whitney test, while on the similar total radiation exposure time (50.7+/-21.1 vs. 52.0+/-19.6 sec, p=0.739), FR (662.2+/-197.0 vs. 685.6+/-211.1, p=0.695), and image counts (10.1+/-2.0 vs. 10.7+/-3.5 images) by student t-test. Conclusion(s): The use of low dose radiation protocol was associated with nearly half amount reduction in exposure to patients undergoing diagnostic angiography without any significant loss of diagnostic information by eyeball estimation. It might provide another strategy to protect the patients and medical workers from potential radiation hazard in the catheterization room. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1011,"High validity of measuring the width and volume of medial meniscal extrusion three-dimensionally using an MRI-derived tibial model. Background: Medial meniscal extrusion (MME) is an important marker of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) progression. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine whether there are morphological differences between CT- and MRI-derived tibial plateau models; and 2) to determine whether measurement of MME volume and width using an MRI-derived tibial model is as accurate as measurements on a CT-derived tibial model. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled ten participants with medial KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 to 3). Primary outcome was surface difference of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived models. Furthermore, volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau were compared between CT- and MRI-derived models. Measurements of MME volume and width were compared between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. Result(s): Minimal and maximal surface differences of the medial tibial plateau between the CT- and MRI-derived models were - 0.15 [- 0.44, 0.14] mm (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 0.24 [- 0.09, 0.57] mm, respectively. There were no significant differences in volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models.

1619,"MRI-based cartilage thickness loss and joint space narrowing in an OAI core progression sample, and their relationship with age, sex, and BMI. Purpose: The aim of this study was 1) To determine the most sensitive measurement location in fixed flexion radiographs (JSW) and MRI (cartilage thickness; ThC), over 2 years, in a core sample of the OAI progression cohort; 2) To evaluate age, sex, and BMI as independent risk factors of structural progression at these locations. Method(s): One knee in each of 541 (224 men) OAI participants enrolled in the progression cohort was studied (all had frequent knee pain; 249 had KL GraDe 2; 292 had KL GraDe 3). Change in medial femorotibial JSW was measured automatically at 7 locations (fixed distances, FD) from PA fixed flexion radiographs, and change in ThC was measured in 16 femorotibial subregions after manually segmenting sagittal DESS images. The standardized response means (SRM) were used to determine the most sensitive measurement locations. Results were compared between men and women, and between the highest vs. lowest tertiles of age and BMI using t-tests, and general linear models with adjustment for the other variables. Beta coefficients (with 95% CI) and standardized beta (Z-scores) are presented. Result(s): In this OAI core sample, the FD 0.225 JSW location was the most sensitive X-ray measure (SRM = 0.40), and the central medial femoro-tibial compartment subregion (cMFTC.ThC) the most sensitive MRI measure for structural progression over two years (SRM = 0.48). Age tertiles studied were 66-79 yrs, vs. 45-56 yrs, and BMI tertiles 31.8-47.7 kg/m2 vs.18.2-27.7. Age, sex, and BMI explained only 2.6% of the variation in structural progression (R2 of adjusted model) in X-ray and 3.9% in MRI. With X-ray, BMI (beta = -0.198mm, 95% CI -0.333, -0.064, standard beta = -0.308) had a significant relationship with progression (Fig. 1), but neither age (adjusted p = 0.587) nor sex (p = 0.099) did. With MRI, high BMI (beta = -0.092mm, 95% CI -0.161, -0.023, standard beta = -0.278), high age (beta = -0.090mm, 95% CI -0.159, -0.021, standard beta = -0.270) and male sex (b= -0.099mm, 95% CI -0.156, -0.042, standard beta = -0.299) were all identified as significant risk factors for structural progression (Fig. 1). Conclusion(s): Measurement locations in the central aspect of the medial femorotibial compartment were most sensitive to structural progression for both imaging methodologies, with MRI providing slightly greater sensitivity to change than fixed flexion radiographs over 2 years. Age, sex, and BMI explained <4% of the variation in structural progression with both methodologies. All were significantly associated with progression as measured with MRI (where men surprisingly showed greater progression than women) while only BMI was associated with progression as measured by X-ray. Our data suggest that MRI may be more sensitive for identifying progression of medial compartment knee OA than plain radiographs. (Figure presented).",Excluded
79,"Salivary gland dysfunction after radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy in patients following total thyroidectomy: Emphasis on radioactive iodine therapy dose. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate symptoms, images of salivary gland dysfunction, and related clinical factors in thyroid cancer patients with total thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy (RIT). Method(s): We included 164 patients who underwent thyroid ultrasonography or contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography more than 6 months later after RIT. Correlation between subjective symptoms and various RIT doses was also evaluated. Result(s): Swelling and decreased salivary volume were the most common symptoms and images.

1472,"Individualized protocol for radiation and contrast medium dose reduction in one-stop assessment for kidney transplantation patients. Objective: To compare image quality, radiation, and contrast medium (CM) doses between individualized and conventional scan protocols in combined coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and iliac artery CTA for kidney transplantation patients. Method(s): 148 patients needing assessment for coronary and iliac arteries before kidney transplantation were prospectively enrolled and randomly divided into the conventional and individualized groups. All patients underwent one-stop combined scans on a 256-row CT scanner with automatic tube current modulation, 50 % pre-ASIR-V to control radiation dose. CCTA was performed first using one heartbeat axial scan mode with bolus tracking technique and iliac CTA was performed 3 s after CCTA using a spiral scan. The conventional group (n = 72) used the standard protocol: 100 kVp, 60 mL of 350 mgI/mL CM at 4.5 mL/s flow rate. The individualized group (n = 76) used a body-mass-index (BMI)-dependent protocol: kVp: 80 (BMI < 24) and 100 (BMI >= 24) and CM: 19 mgI/kg (BMI < 18); 21 mgI/kg (18 <= BMI < 24); and 22 mgI/kg (BMI >= 24). Image quality radiation and CM doses of the two groups were compared. Result(s): There was no significant difference in patient demographic data. Compared with the conventional group, the individualized group reduced contrast flow rate (in mL/s) by 14.4 % (3.85 +/- 0.72 vs. 4.5), contrast dose (in mL) by 35.8 % (38.53 +/- 7.18 vs. 60) and radiation dose (in mSv) by 34.3 % (4.30 +/- 1.73 vs. 6.54 +/- 1.45). The individualized group had significantly higher subjective image quality score (P < 0.05), lower noise (17.30 +/- 4.97 HU vs. 19.13 +/- 4.73 HU, P = 0.02) and higher signal-to-noise ratio (22.09 +/- 7.41 vs. 19.55 +/- 6.18, P = 0.03) for the three main vessels in CCTA compared with the conventional group. There were no differences in both subjective scores and objective measurements in iliac artery CTA between the two groups. Conclusion(s): The individualized scanning protocol in the one-stop assessment of coronary and iliac arteries before kidney transplantation significantly reduces both radiation and CM doses while maintaining image quality in iliac artery CTA and providing better coronary artery images in CCTA.Copyright © 2021",Excluded

Results The mean change in uptake at the 1-min massage was 0.97 +/- 11.27%, whereas that at the 1-min control was 11.54 +/-5.59% (P<0.001). The mean change in uptake at the 2-min massage was also significantly lower than that at the 2-min control (11.11 +/- 6.97 vs. -0.85 +/- 9.78%, P<0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed between the mean changes in uptake after 1-and 2-min massages (P=0.573)., Conclusion PG massage reduced the radioiodine uptake in the PG, and the effect of PG massage for 1 min was comparable with that of PG massage for 2 min. PG massage can be applied to thyroid cancer patients who receive radioiodine therapy to reduce PG dysfunction., Background To prevent salivary dysfunction in thyroid cancer patients who have undergone radioiodine ablation, massaging the parotid gland (PG) is presumed to be helpful for the removal of radioiodine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of PG massage in the removal of radioiodine from the PG Nucl Med Commun 35:1127-1131, Methods Forty-four patients (female, 38; 49.1+/- 11.0 years) who underwent total thyroidectomy followed by I-131 ablation were included in this prospective study. Three serial salivary gland scans were performed 2 h after administration of I-123 in thyroid hormone withdrawal status. The patients were divided into two groups. There was a 1-min (or 2-min) interval between the first and second scans for control, followed by the performance of PG massage for 1 min (or 2 min) between the second and third scans.

553,"Outcomes of carotid angioplasty and stenting for radiation-associated stenosis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In light of their high surgical risk, carotid angioplasty and stent placement may be preferred in patients with radiation-associated carotid stenosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the procedural complication rate, patency, and clinical outcomes after carotid angioplasty and stent placement in this small group of high-risk patients., METHODS: Sixteen patients (mean age, 65 years; 5 women and 11 men) who received radiation therapy for head and/or neck malignancy subsequently developed carotid stenosis (mean, 84%; range, 70%-99%) in a total of 19 carotid arteries, which were treated with angioplasty and stent placement. The patients were followed for a mean time of 28 months (range, 5-78 months) with periodic Doppler studies, angiography, CT angiography, or clinically., RESULTS: In the total 19 stented carotid arteries, 23 procedures were performed (22 stent placement procedures and one repeat angioplasty). The procedural stroke rate was 1/23 (4%). The procedural transient ischemic attack rate was 0/23 (0%). There was one other observed complication: a puncture site hematoma. The 30-day postprocedure complication rate was 0/23 (0%); no neurologic symptoms were reported. Fifteen of the 19 vessels (79%) developed no new stenosis throughout the follow-up period. Two of 19 (11%) vessels had repeat angioplasty and stent placement; 1/19 (5%) had a repeat angioplasty. One restented vessel has remained patent for 50 months. Another restented vessel required a third stent placement 17 months after the second. Two of 19 (11%) vessels occluded per Doppler examination 14 and 22 months postprocedure., CONCLUSION: Angioplasty and stent placement have low rates of complications and restenosis in the treatment of radiation-associated carotid occlusive disease.",Excluded
2690,"Effect of Yangyin Humo Decoction on oral mucomembranous reaction to radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Yangyin Humo Decoction (YHD) on oral mucomembranous reaction in patients with head-neck tumor undergoing radiotherapy., METHODS: Forty-Forty-two patients with head-neck tumor undergoing radiotherapy were randomized equally into two groups. The two conventional Western medical treatment was administered to all, including intravenous dripping of 2% lidocaine 20 mL, dexamethasone 5 mg, gentamycin 80,000 units, vitamin B(12) 5 mg, dissolved in saline 250 mL, and 5% sodium bicarbonate solution for gargling, but to the patients in the tested group, YHD was given additionally. The medication was started simultaneously all through the whole course of the radiotherapy. Patients were examined every day to observe and compare the degree, initiating time, and repairing time of their oral lesions; the dosage of radiation they received was recorded as well., RESULTS: The degree of mucomembranous reaction that appeared in most patients in the test group was of grade 1-2, while in the control group, it was grade 2-3. The average time for oral lesion of 1, 2, 3 grades to be initiated in the test group was 12.0+/-1.1, 11.0+/-1.3 and 10.0+/-0.8 days, respectively, after radiation started, which was later than that in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the average repairing time for the lesions of grades 1, 2, and 3 in the test group was 3.0+/-0.7, 10.0+/-1.3 and 19.0+/-0.8 days, which were shorter than those in the control group respectively (P<0.01). The radiation applied on the primary tumor of patients with oral lesion of grade 1-3 in the test group was 24.2+/-2.2, 42.0+/-2.6 and 58.0+/-1.6 Gy on the average, respectively, which were higher than that applied on patients in the control group (P<0.05 or P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: The Chinese herbal preparation YHD could alleviate oral mucomembranous reaction to radiation applied in patients with head-neck tumor.",Excluded
653,"Reirradiation of Head and Neck Cancers With Proton Therapy: Outcomes and Analyses. PURPOSE: Reirradiation of head and neck (H&N) cancer is a clinical challenge. Proton radiation therapy (PRT) offers dosimetric advantages for normal tissue sparing and may benefit previously irradiated patients. Here, we report our initial experience with the use of PRT for H&N reirradiation, with focus on clinical outcomes and toxicity., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who received H&N reirradiation with PRT from April 2011 through June 2015. Patients reirradiated with palliative intent or without prior documentation of H&N radiation therapy were excluded. Radiation-related toxicities were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0., RESULTS: The conditions of 60 patients were evaluated, with a median follow-up time of 13.6 months. Fifteen patients (25%) received passive scatter proton therapy (PSPT), and 45 (75%) received intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Thirty-five patients (58%) received upfront surgery, and 44 (73%) received concurrent chemotherapy. The 1-year rates of locoregional failure-free survival, overall survival, progression-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival were 68.4%, 83.8%, 60.1%, and 74.9%, respectively. Eighteen patients (30%) experienced acute grade 3 (G3) toxicity, and 13 (22%) required a feeding tube at the end of PRT. The 1-year rates of late G3 toxicity and feeding tube independence were 16.7% and 2.0%, respectively. Three patients may have died of reirradiation-related effects (1 acute and 2 late)., CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy can be a safe and effective curative reirradiation strategy, with acceptable rates of toxicity and durable disease control.

Background: To examine toxicity and outcomes for patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for gastric cancer. Method(s): Patients with gastroesophageal (GE) junction (Siewert type II and III) or gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent neoadjuvant CRT followed by planned surgical resection at Duke University between 1987 and 2009 were reviewed. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Result(s): Forty-eight patients were included. Most (73%) had proximal (GE junction, cardia and fundus) tumors. Median radiation therapy dose was 45 Gy. All patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients (75%) underwent surgery. Pathologic complete response and R0 resection rates were 19% and 86%, respectively. Thirty-day surgical mortality was 6%. At 42 months median follow-up, 3-year actuarial OS was 40%. For patients undergoing surgery, 3-year OS, LC and DFS were 50%, 73% and 41%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Preoperative CRT for gastric cancer is well tolerated with acceptable rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality. In this patient cohort with primarily advanced disease, OS, LC and DFS rates in resected patients are comparable to similarly staged, adjuvantly treated patients in randomized trials.

309,"Eos, o-arm and standard spine radiographs; What is the cumulative radiation exposure during current scoliosis management?. Background/introduction: During the course of assessment and treatment for AIS, patients are subjected to repeated radiological exposure. Only a few studies have evaluated the total absorbed radiation dose from standard radiography and EOS during follow-up for scoliosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare total radiation dose exposure from all modalities for a cohort of AIS patients. Purpose of the study: The primary aim of this study was to determine the radiation exposure of AIS patients during scoliosis management. Moreover, this study aimed to compare follow-up algorithms among international spine centers. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review on radiation exposure of patients treated for AIS. Inclusions: patients followed for AIS from 2013 to 2016 without neuromuscular diseases. The O-arm conebeam CT scanner was used for 3D navigation in all surgically managed patients, low dose protocols were used (70 kVp, 80 mAs). A survey asking for information on radiological algorithms and imaging frequencies was sent to a number of international spine centers for comparison with in-house algorithm. Result(s): 61 patients were included, 19 were treated conservatively (M/F: 6/13) and 42 surgically (M/F: 11/31). Median follow up time for the conservative group was 8 (range 0-51) months and 37 (range 13-163) months for the surgical group. Median number of X-rays/EOS were; 2 (range 0-20)/2 (range 0-17) for the conservative group and 15 (range 2-57)/11(range 0-26) for the surgery group. Patients undergoing surgery received a median cumulative radiation dose of 10.31 mSv (range 3.79-20.43) vs. a median dose of 1.09 mSv (range 0.22-7.17) for those treated conservatively. Approximately 25% (39.04/161.82 mSv) of total intraoperative radiation dose for all patients was a result of O-arm 2D fluoroscopy. A mean of 11 levels of the spine were fused during correction surgeries. Median Cobb angle at the beginning/end of follow up were 19-(range 10--50-)/23- (range 12--65-) for the conservative group and 44- (range 10--80-)/15- (range 4--30-) for the surgery group. Median Cobb angle before the surgery was 52- (range 36--82-). The results of the questionnaire showed great variety of radiological follow-up algorithms among 8 spine centers without adherence to any of the published consensus statements. Conclusion(s): Surgically treated patients were, as anticipated, exposed to more, radiation dose than those treated conservatively, almost 10-fold more, owing mainly to intraoperative 3D scans and a larger numbers of radiological follow-up examinations. The use of conebeam CT-based 3D navigation elevates patient safety during deformity surgery. However, patients are potentially exposed to a significant amount of radiation depending on protocol and use of 2D fluoroscopy. Further awareness of ways to reduce radiation dose and optimize radiological protocols is warranted in order to decrease radiation-induced malignancy.",Excluded

AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Cyberknife treatment for patients with advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival.

Background The aim of this trial was to determine feasibility of incorporating bevacizumab (B) into concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods Patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were accrued in 2 strata, low- and high-risk (squamous histology, hemoptysis, tumor with cavitation and/or adjacent to a major vessel). Cohort 1 patients received cisplatin 50 mg/m2 days (d) 1 and 8, etoposide 50 mg/m2 (d 1-5) for 2 cycles concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) followed by docetaxel (D) 75 mg/m2 and B 15 mg/kg for 3 cycles. If safety was established, then accrual would continue to cohort 2 (B, d 15, 36, 57) and then subsequently to cohort 3 (B, d 1, 22, 43). Results Twenty-nine patients (17 low- and 12 high-risk) registered to cohort 1. Twenty-six patients (including 4 squamous, 1 adenosquamous) were assessable. Twenty-five completed CRT. Grade 3/4 toxicities during CRT included acceptable rates of hematologic toxicity, esophagitis, and pneumonitis. Of 21 assessable for safety with D/B consolidation, major adverse events were pneumonitis (2 Grade 3) and 2 episodes of fatal hemoptysis in the high-risk group, resulting in closure of this stratum. The low-risk stratum subsequently closed because of slow accrual. Median overall survival was 46 months for low-risk and 17 months for high-risk strata. Conclusion Bevacizumab was not safely integrated into CRT for stage III NSCLC in patients considered at high risk for hemoptysis. In lower risk patients, data are insufficient to determine safety or efficacy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

3655,"Studies on mutagen-sensitive strains of Drosophila melanogaster, VIII. Further data on differences between Canton-S and ebony strains with respect to maternal effects for the X-ray induction of autosomal translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa. The influence of the maternal genotype (Canton-S, proficient in the repair of X-ray-induced chromosome breaks and ebony, less proficient in this regard) on the recovery of X-ray-induced autosomal (II-III) translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa was studied. In the first series of experiments, males carrying appropriate markers on their second and third chromosomes were irradiated and mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of II-III translocations were determined. In the second series of experiments, males carrying ring-X chromosomes were irradiated in N2 or in O2, mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of XO males were determined; additionally, under similar gas-treatment and radiation conditions, the pattern of egg-mortality was also assessed. The data on translocations show that the yields are higher with ebony than with Canton-S females; these and earlier results on dominant lethals and sex-linked recessive lethals support the interpretation that the maternal repair system in the ebony strain is less proficient and more error-prone than that of the Canton-S strain. Those on the losses of ring-X chromosomes demonstrate that (i) the absolute yields of XO males are lower with ebony than with Canton-S females irrespective of whether the parental males are irradiated in N2 or in O2; (ii) the exposure-frequency relationships are all linear, but the slopes are higher when the males are irradiated in O2 and are consistent with an oxygen-enhancement-ratio of about 1.5 and (iii) the relationships between the logarithm of egg-survival and XO male frequency are also linear, but the slopes for the O2 groups are lower than those for the N2 groups (slope ratios of 0.86-0.87). The finding that at given survival levels, the XO frequencies are lower in the O2 than in the N2 groups of both the Canton-S and ebony series viewed in the context of the mechanisms that have been postulated to explain the loss of ring-X chromosomes in irradiated mature spermatozoa permits the following interpretation for the observed results: (i) a higher proportion of potential XO zygotes is lost through dominant lethality in the O2 groups than in the N2 ones presumably because the chromosome breaks induced in O2 are qualitatively different in the sense that they have a higher probability to undergo reunions relative to restitution, compared with breaks induced under anoxia and (ii) this leads to lower than expected oxygen-enhancement ratios (i.e., expected on the basis of published data on sex-linked recessive lethals, another kind of genetic damage which shows a linear exposure-frequency relationship.",Excluded

The performances of MRI with or without CEA parameters (initial CEA and CEA dynamics) for prediction of pathologic tumor response grade (pTRG) were compared by receiver-operating characteristic analysis with DeLong s method. Cox regression was used to identify the independent factors associated to pTRG and disease-free survival (DFS) after NCRT. Results The median follow-up was 64.0 months (range, 3.0 to 113.0 months). On multivariate analysis, poor tumor regression grade on MRI (mrTRG; p < 0.001), initial CEA (p < 0.001) and the mesorectal fascia involvement on MRI before NCRT (mrMFI; p=0.054) showed association with poor pTRG. The mrTRG plus CEA parameters showed significantly improved performances in the prediction of pTRG than mrTRG alone. All of mrTRG, mrMFI, and initial CEA were also identified as independent factors associated with DFS. The initial CEA further discriminated DFS in the subgroups with good mrTRG or that without mrMFI. Conclusion The CEA parameters significantly improved the performance of MRI in the prediction of pTRG after NCRT for patients with rectal cancer. The DFS was further discriminated by initial CEA level in the groups with favorable MRI parameters.Copyright ©2020 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
1167,"Biodistribution, radiation dosimetry, and clinical application of a melanin-targeted PET probe,18F-P3BZA, in patients. N-(2-(diethylamino)-ethyl)-18F-5-fluoropicolinamide (18F-P3BZA) is a radiotracer that demonstrates high binding selectivity and affinity in melanoma. The aim of the present study was to estimate the biodistribution and clinical radiation dosimetry of18F-P3BZA in healthy volunteers and perform a preliminary clinical application for PET/CT imaging in melanoma patients. Method(s):18F-P3BZA was produced efficiently with a radiosynthesizer. Six healthy volunteers were injected with18F-P3BZA (211.7 +/- 15.4 MBq) followed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans and blood tests to assess biodistribution, pharmacokinetic, and radiation dosimetry at 10 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h after injection. The vital signs of volunteers were recorded in regular intervals during the imaging sessions. The effective dose for each subject after the medical internal radiation dosimetry schema was calculated with OLINDA/EXM software. For the preliminary clinical application, 5 patients with suspected melanomas underwent18F-P3BZA PET/CT imaging at 10 min and 1 h after injection. All patients also underwent18F-FDG PET/CT scans on the third day to compare the potential diagnostic ability of18F-P3BZA with18F-FDG. Result(s): The radiochem-istry yield of18F-P3BZA labeling was 12.3% +/- 3.9%, and the purity of18F-P3BZA after purification and formulation was higher than 99.5%. The highest uptake of18F-P3BZA was in the liver with an SUVmean of 8.3 +/- 1.0 at 10 min after injection. The resultant whole-body effective dose was 0.0193 mSv/MBq.18F-P3BZA showed high uptake and suggested an ability for specific imaging of melanoma and its metastasis in patients. The average SUVmean of18F-P3BZA and18F-FDG in tumors was 19.7 +/- 5.3 and 10.8 +/- 2.7 at 60 min after injection. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that18F-P3BZA is safe and compatible for clinical use. The first-in-human clinical application to melanoma showed favorable delineated tumors in patients, demonstrating the potential of18F-P3BZA for diagnostic PET imaging of melanoma.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.",Excluded

Intractable bleeding was suggested to related to the aggravation of the local condition of the urinary tract and recurrent bleeding with an increase of complications, especially diabetes mellitus and hypertension. In conclusion, long-term follow up of local conditions and complications is important in the prevention of intractable and recurrent bleeding of radiation cystitis.",Excluded
1600,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 16 patients with locally advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma-a phase 1 study. Background and Objectives: It is believed that chemotherapy (ChT) is ineffective in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The aim of our retrospective chart review was to find out if neodjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery had any effect on the size of primary tumor in patients with PTC. Method(s): In the period 1976-2006, 1,207 patients were treated for PTC at our Institute. The study included 16 patients (13 women, 3 men; mean age 63.5 years) with PTC, who were treated with neoadjuvant ChT from 1988-2005. Poorly differentiated PTC, classical PTC, follicular variant of PTC and Hurthle cell variant of PTC was diagnosed in five cases, five, three and three cases, respectively. A mean tumor diameter was 9.9 cm (range 5-22 cm). Seven patients had pT4 tumor. Regional metastases were detected in ten patients and distant metastases in seven patients. ChT consisted of Vinblastine in eleven cases, Vinblastine with Adriamyin in two cases and other schedules in three cases. Three patients were treated also with preoperative external irradiation. Result(s): Altogether, 40 cycles of ChT were given. After ChT tumor size decreased in all 16 patients: for more than 50% in seven (= 44%) patients and for less than 50% in nine patients. R0, R1 and R2 resection was performed in two, ten and four cases, respectively. Median survival of our patients was 92 (range 11-240) months. Six patients are still alive (median survival 157 months) and two of them have no evidence of disease. Two patients died of causes not related to carcinoma, while eight patients died of PTC (five of distant metastases, one of locoregional disease, two of distant metastases and locoregional disease). Conclusion(s): Neoadjuvant ChT before thyroid surgery may be effective in patients with locally advanced PTC. After neoadjuvant ChT, in 44% of our patients the tumor size decreased for more than 50%.",Excluded
2162,"The in situ repair kinetics of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in human skin types I and II. We assessed the in situ time-dependent loss of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in skin types I and II after exposure to two minimal erythema doses of solar-simulating radiation on previously unexposed buttock skin. Using quantitative image analysis, we evaluated biopsy sections stained with monoclonal antibodies. We then made comparisons, in the same volunteers, with unscheduled DNA synthesis, which is a direct marker of overall excision repair. Removal of thymine dimers was slow (half-life = 33.3 h), with high levels of lesions still present 24 h post-irradiation; some lesions were still present at 7 d. In contrast, removal of 6-4 photoproducts was rapid (half-life = 2.3 h), the decay kinetics of which correlated better with the decline in epidermal unscheduled DNA synthesis (half-life = 7.1 h). These data show that as in mouse, monkey, and in vitro models, the 6-4 photolesion is repaired preferentially in human epidermis in situ. They also raise the possibility that poor thymine dimer repair may be a feature of skin types I and II, who are more prone to skin cancer than are types III and IV. There was an inverse relationship between the onset of erythema and 6-4 photoproduct repair, suggesting that this repair process initiates erythema.",Excluded
1657,"A phase II trial of stereotactic body radiation therapy for operable T1N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer: Japan clinical oncology group (JCOG0403). Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a rapidly prevailing treatment modality suggesting high effectiveness in the treatment of medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It has also been applied in operable stage I NSCLC patients, but the prospective data have not been available yet. The purpose of JCOG0403 was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SBRT in patients with both operable and medically inoperable T1N0M0 NSCLC (UICC 6th ed., 2002), and this is the first report analyzed for operable population. Materials/Methods: The eligibility criteria included histologically or cytologically proven NSCLC, clinical T1N0M0, operable patients assessed by thoracic surgeons, PS 0-2, >= 20 years old, PaO2 >= 60 torr, FEV1.0>= 700 mL, and written informed consent. The prescription was 48 Gy at the isocenter in 4 fractions over 4-8 days. 4-10 MV X rays were allowed. Heterogeneity corrected doses by pencil beam algorithms were used. The GTV included the primary tumor only, CTV margin was not considered, and ITV margin and 5 mm setup margin were added. As a quality assurance program, credentialing of institutions and an individual case review using the Image-guided Therapy Center (ITC) remote review tool were performed. The primary endpoint was the three-year overall survival. The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), local-progression free survival (LPFS), event-free survival (EFS), toxicity, and patterns of failure. The sample size was determined so that the 95% confidence interval for the estimated 3-year OS would be +/- 10% around expected value of 80%. Result(s): Between July 2004 and January 2007, 65 patientswere registered in this study from15 institutions.The patients characteristics were:male 45, female 20; median age 79 (range, 50-91);median tumor size 21mm(range, 10-30mm); adenocarcinomas 40, squamous cell carcinomas 21, others 4; and PS 0/1/2, 43/20/2. All patients completed the protocol treatment. At the last follow-up in November 2009, median follow-up of censored cases was 45.4 months. of the eligible 64 patients, the 3-year overall survival was 76.0% (95% CI: 63.3% - 84.8%). To date, a total of 25 progressions were observed, and the 3-year PFS, LPFS, and EFS were 54.5% (95% CI: 41.5% - 65.7%), 68.5% (95% CI: 55.5% -78.4%) and 51.4% (95% CI: 38.6% - 62.9%), respectively. Grade 3 toxicity was observed in chest pain 1 (1.5%), dyspnea 2 (3.1%), hypoxia 1 (1.5%), and pneumonitis 2 (3.1%). No grade 4 and 5 toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): SBRT for operable stage I NSCLC is highly effective with mild toxicity.

In a retrospective study, two mandibular prosthetic rehabilitation strategies supported by implants in oral cancer patients were evaluated: implants placed in the non-resected edentulous symphyseal area during ablative surgery (DAS implants); or at a later stage (postponed (P) implants). Medical files of patients from two head-neck oncology groups from 2000 to 2005 were screened for study inclusion. DAS protocol was used in one group and P protocol in the other. After a 5 year follow-up of 261 edentulous patients with oral cancer in the second group, P implants were placed in 27 patients to support an overdenture. Of the 249 edentulous patients in the first group, 82 patients were given an implant supported overdenture using the DAS implant protocol. Regarding implant loss, no statistically significant differences were seen between the DAS and P implants. In the DAS group, more patients benefited from an implant-supported lower overdenture (39 versus 11%, respectively), and they received their overdenture on average 20.0 months sooner (sd=11.01, p<0.001) after ablative surgery. 17.1% of DAS implants and 4.6% of P implants were never loaded due to tumour and patient related factors including unfavourable implant soft tissue, tumour recurrence near the implant, or radiotherapy induced trismus.

During the study, a standard protocol was used, the same as for men, with a minimum period of time spent outside the immersion bath. Before, during and after Immersion, 22 experiments were carried out aimed at studying the neurophysiological, functional, metabolic and psychophysiological functions of the body, the results of which will be presented in future publications. The total time outside the bath for women did not exceed that for men. Systolic and diastolic pressure did not significantly change during the immersion. In the first 24 h after the end of the immersion, heart rate was significantly higher than the background values [F(4,20) = 14.67; P < 0.0001]. Changes in body temperature and water balance were consistent with the patterns found in men. No significant changes in height and weight were found during immersion.

765,"Induction of high-frequency oscillations in a junction-coupled network. Rhythmic oscillations of up to 600 Hz in grouped neurons frequently occur in the brains of animals. These high-frequency oscillations can be sustained in calcium-free conditions and may be blocked by gap junction blockers, implying a key role for electrical synapses in oscillation generation. Mathematical theories have been developed to demonstrate oscillations mediated by electrical synapses without chemical modulation; however, these models have not been verified in animals. Here we report that oscillations of up to 686 Hz are induced by paired spikes of short spike intervals (SIs) in a junction-coupled network. To initiate oscillations, it was essential that the second spike was elicited during the relative refractory period. The second spike suffered from slow propagation speed and failure to transmit through a low-conductance junction. Thus, at the spike initiation site, paired spikes of short SIs triggered one transjunctional spike in the postsynaptic neuron. At distant synaptic sites, two transjunctional spikes were produced as the SI increased during spike propagation. Consequently, spike collision of these asymmetrical transjunctional spikes occurred in the interconnected network. The remaining single spike reverberated in a network serving as an oscillator center. Paired-spike-induced oscillations were modeled by computer simulation and verified electrophysiologically in a network that mediates the tail-flip escape response of crayfish.",Excluded
2533,"A propensity-score matching analysis comparing long-term survival of surgery alone and postoperative treatment for patients in node positive or stage III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after R0 esophagectomy. Background: Surveillance was recommended for patients after R0 esophagectomy by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. However, local failure was high in locally advanced patients (48-78%). The present study aimed to determine whether adjuvant treatment improved survival for stage IIb-III thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (TESCC). Method(s): A retrospective review of patients diagnosed as esophageal carcinoma at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer hospital, between January 2004 and December 2011, was performed. A database compiling 975 patents with node positive or stage III thoracic esophageal carcinoma after R0 surgery with or without postoperative radiation/chemoradiation was created. A 1:1 matched study group was generated by the Greedy method after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Survival curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Result(s): 975 patients were enrolled in the study, 510 patients (52.3%) did not receive any postoperative treatment after R0 surgery and 465 patients had either postoperative chemoradiation or radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 69.2 months. After PSM, 222 well-balanced patients in each group demonstrated the same results. The 3-year, 5-year survival rates and median survival in surgery group (33.0%, 26.4%, 24.3 months) were inferior to those in postoperative treatment group (48.3%, 37.1% and 34.3 months), (P = 0.002).

126,"What radiation exposure can a patient expect during a single stone episode?. Purpose: There is increasing concern about the risks of radiation exposure with the advent of new, more complex imaging modalities. For example, computed tomography (CT), with its obvious advantages, is being more commonly used in the investigation of acute flank pain. The likely radiation exposure a patient can expect during a single complete urinary stone episode was studied. Patients and Methods: The hospital records of 60 consecutive unselected patients who had become or were rendered stone-free were studied. The effective radiation doses in milliSieverts (mSV) associated with diagnostic imaging modalities such as intravenous urogram studies and CT scans were calculated for St. George's Hospital. By combining these with the published effective doses for interventional examinations, the total effective dose over an entire stone episode was derived. Result(s): There were a total of 60 patients with 68 stones (15 renal, 9 in the upper, 12 in the middle, and 32 in the lower ureter), with a median stone burden of 4 mm. Thirty-two patients had procedures performed, including extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy SWL. Total effective doses ranged from 1.18 to 37.66 mSv (median 5.3 mSv; 95% CI of the median 4.13, 7.61). Renal and proximal ureteral stones resulted in the highest radiation exposures. Conclusion(s): In this study the median radiation dose per stone episode was calculated at 5.3 mSv, with higher doses in those with renal stones and those who required CT scans and other interventions.

230,"Oncogenic N-Ras Mitigates Oxidative Stress-Induced Apoptosis of Hematopoietic Stem Cells. Leukemic relapse is believed to be driven by transformed hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that harbor oncogenic mutations or have lost tumor suppressor function. Recent comprehensive sequencing studies have shown that mutations predicted to activate Ras signaling are highly prevalent in hematologic malignancies and, notably, in refractory and relapsed cases. To better understand what drives this clinical phenomenon, we expressed oncogenic NrasG12D within the hematopoietic system in mice and interrogated its effects on HSC survival. N-RasG12D conferred a survival benefit to HSCs and progenitors following metabolic and genotoxic stress. This effect was limited to HSCs and early progenitors and was independent of autophagy and cell proliferation. N-RasG12D-mediated HSC survival was not affected by inhibition of canonical Ras effectors such as MEK and PI3K. However, inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector pathway protein kinase C (PKC) ameliorated the protective effects of N-RasG12D. Mechanistically, N-RasG12D lowered levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which correlated with reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels. Inhibition of PKC restored the levels of ROS to that of control HSCs and abrogated the protective effects granted by N-RasG12D. Thus, N-RasG12D activation within HSCs promotes cell survival through the mitigation of ROS, and targeting this mechanism may represent a viable strategy to induce apoptosis during malignant transformation of HSCs. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting oncogenic N-Ras-mediated reduction of ROS in hematopoietic stem cells through inhibition of the noncanonical Ras effector PKC may serve as a novel strategy for treatment of leukemia and other Ras-mutated cancers.

2777,"Epidemiological features of brain tumors. Brain tumors account for 1.4% of all cancers and 2.4% of all cancer-related deaths. The incidence of brain tumors varies and it is higher in developed countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In Serbia, according to data from 2009, malignant brain tumors account for 2.2 of all tumors, and from all cancer-related deaths, 3.2% is caused by malignant brain tumors. According to recent statistical reports, an overall incidence of brain tumors for benign and malignant tumors combined is 18.71 per 100,000 persons/year. The most common benign brain tumor in adults is meningioma, which is most present in women, and the most common malignant tumor is glioblastoma, which is most present in adult men. Due to high mortality, especially in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and significant brain tumor morbidity, there is a constant interest in understanding its etiology in order to possibly prevent tumor occurrence in future and enable more efficient treatment strategies for this fatal brain disease. Despite the continuously growing number of epidemiological studies on possible factors of tumor incidence, the etiology remains unclear. The only established environmental risk factor of gliomas is ionizing radiation exposure. Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields via cell phone use has gained a lot of attention as a potential risk factor of brain tumor development.

INTRODUCTION: The liver is critical in multiple processes, including the clearance of endogenous compounds, the synthesis of macromolecules, and organ-specific biotransformation processes. Therefore, the liver's regenerating capacity is of vital importance. Multiple pathways are activated in the complex process that leads to hepatic regeneration. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of proton pump inhibitors omeprozole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole on hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four groups were formed with 32 rats in each. Partial liver resections were performed for all animals. Omeprazole (71.4 microg/day), lansoprazole (107 microg/day), pantoprazole (143 microg/day) and placebo (0.5 cm(3)) were administered to the groups respectively. A quarter of the rats in each group were sacrificed on the 1st postoperative day. The rest were sacrificed on the 3rd, 5th and 7th postoperative days. The remnant regenerating liver mass was removed and weighed, and Ki-67 monoclonal antibody levels were measured., RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the four groups on the first day in evaluating the weight of the liver mass (p = 0.09) and Ki-67 (p = 0.268) levels. Only the omeprazole group showed a difference; the Ki-67 level was lower in the omeprazole group on the 3rd (p = 0.003, p = 0.0001, p = 0.003), 5th (p = 0.017, p = 0.001, p = 0.0001) and 7th (p = 0.0001) days compared to the other groups. Also the weight of the remnant liver mass was lower in the omeprazole group on the 3rd, 5th and 7th (p = 0.0001) days., CONCLUSION: We figured out that lansoprazole and pantoprazole have no effects on liver regeneration, whereas omeprazole showed a negative effect on hepatic regeneration.",Excluded

1862,"Comparison of Whole Heart Computed Tomography Scanners for Image Quality Lower Radiation Dosing in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: The CONVERGE Registry. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Novel technology in coronary computed tomographic angiography allows assessment of coronary artery disease with high image quality (IQ). There are currently two wide detector ""whole heart"" coverage scanners available, which avoid misregistration artifacts. However, there are no data directly comparing IQ between the two scanners. The aim of the current study is to investigate if IQ is different between the most scanners of GE and Toshiba broad detector scanners., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter international cohort study comparing 236 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography using whole-heart scanners; 126 patients on scanner S1 ( Aquilion ONE Vision, Toshiba), and 110 patients on scanner S2 (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). Hounsfield units were measured using regions of interest in the descending aorta at 6 points (cranial slice, level of the visualized first, second, third, and fourth spines, and the caudal slice). We also compared the coverage length (z-axis) of the full width field of view between a single rotation of the two scanners., RESULTS: Evaluating mean CT attenuation values Hounsfield units through the scan range, are progressively reduced across the descending aorta in the S1 group, resulting in the larger difference of contrast brightness between the cranial and caudal slices compared to the S2 group (absolute difference: S2 13.0 +/- 4.4 vs S1 141.9 +/- 16.4, p < 0.0001; Percent difference: 19.3 +/- 2.1 vs -3.4 +/- 1.2, <0.0001). The standard deviation (SD) is similar at the cranial slice between the two scanners, however, the S1 group demonstrated higher SD-differential from cranial to caudal than S2 group. Median radiation exposure was significantly lower for the S2 scanner 1.50 +/- 0.75 mSv vs the S1 system 1.9 mSv (IQR 1.7-2.7 mSv) (p=0.01). Z-axis coverage was larger for the S2 scanner 152.5 mm (244 slices x 0.625 mm/slice) than 133 mm for S1 (266 slices x 0.5 mm/slice)., CONCLUSION: Although both ""volume"" scanners cover the whole heart z-axis with one beat, scans using the S1 scanner have a larger variability in attenuation values throughout the scan range, resulting in 20% increase in nonuniformity from cranial to caudal slice. Additionally, SD variation across the field of view, a metric of noise, is larger when using the S1 scanner vs the S2 scanner. These results indicate that the GE Revolution CT has more uniform contrast enhancement and more coverage, lower radiation and lower image noise compared to the Toshiba Aquilion ONE Vision system.

BACKGROUND: Airway complications after lung transplantation remain a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Interventional bronchoscopic management continues to be the main modality in the management of these problems., METHODS: Four patients with airway stenoses after lung transplantation received high dose rate brachytherapy for management of recurrent stenosis. All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction.

Survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier curve method (log rank test; P < 0.05)., RESULTS: The radiographic responses in patients with carcinoid tumors comprised a minor response in 2 patients (10%), stable disease in 16 patients (80%; median time to progression, 34 mo), and progressive disease in 2 patients (10%). The symptomatic responses in patients with functioning carcinoid tumors comprised complete resolution in 3 of the 11 evaluable symptomatic patients (27%), partial resolution in 6 patients (55%), and no significant change in 11 patients. The median overall survival in patients with carcinoid tumors was 47 mo (95% confidence interval, 32-62), and the median progression-free survival was 34 mo (95% confidence interval, 13-55). Relevant treatment toxicities were confined to transient myelosuppression of grade 3 or 4 in 15.3% (leukopenia) and 7.6% (thrombocytopenia) of applied cycles and a suspected late adverse event (3% of patients), myelodysplastic syndrome, after a cumulative administered activity of 66.6 GBq. The most frequent nonhematologic side effect was mild nausea (grade 1 or 2), which was observed in 28% of administered cycles. No hepatic or renal toxicities were noted., CONCLUSION: Dose-intensified treatment with (131)I-MIBG at a fixed dose of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi) per cycle is safe and offers effective palliation of symptoms and disease stabilization in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. The favorable survival and limited toxicity suggest that high cycle activities are suitable and that this modality may be used for targeted carcinoid treatment--either as an alternative or as an adjunct to other existing therapeutic options.",Excluded

Aim: This study compares angular stable intramedullary nailing with volar plating for the treatment of displaced fractures of the distal radius. Material(s) and Method(s): In a prospective randomized trial patients with extraarticular fractures of the distal radius (AO 23 A3) were randomly assigned to receive either palmar plating (PP) (2.4mm, Synthes, USA) or intramedullary nailing (TDR) (Targon DR, Aesculap, Germany). Follow up examinations were performed 8 weeks and 2 years post surgery. Result(s): 152 patients (129 female and 23 male, mean age 62.9+/-15.6 years) were included and randomly assigned to receive either PP (n = 72) or TDR (n = 80). Complete clinical and radiological follow up was obtained in 122 patients. All fractures united. The mean palmar tilt was 2.2degree for palmar plating and 2.9degree for intramedullary nailing. Significant differences within groups (p < 0.05, students-t-test, posthoc: Bonferroni) were recorded for time for surgery (Targon DR: 41+/-21 min; 2.4mm plate: 51+/-18 min) for x-ray time (Targon DR: 1.2+/-0.3 min; 2.4mm plate: 0.9+/-0.2 min) as well as for early pain and motor function (Targon DR: VAS 1.2+/-0.2, Ext./Flex. 82%; 2.4mm plate: VAS 1.6+/-0.4, Ext./Flex. 76%). No differences were seen after two years. Osteopenic bone loss as measured by pQCT was seen in 73% of cases and qualitiy of life assessment (SF 36) revealed excellent social and physical function without differences within groups. Complications were CTS (4 PP, 2 TDR), temp. paresthesia of the superficial n. radialis branch (2 TDR), screw overlength (n = 2 PP, n = 2 TDR), intraarticular screw location (n = 2 PP) or extensor tendon affection (n = 4 PP). Conclusion(s): Intramedullary nailing for distal radial fractures is advantageous in terms of pain reduction and early motion when compared to volar plating. The late functional results of both techniques are comparable as well as the fixation stability in osteoporotic fractures.",Excluded
3281,"Combined FET PET/MRI radiomics differentiates radiation injury from recurrent brain metastasis. Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined textural feature analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and static O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation between local recurrent brain metastasis and radiation injury since CE-MRI often remains inconclusive. Method(s): Fifty-two patients with new or progressive contrast-enhancing brain lesions on MRI after radiotherapy (predominantly stereotactic radiosurgery) of brain metastases were additionally investigated using FET PET. Based on histology (n = 19) or clinicoradiological follow-up (n = 33), local recurrent brain metastases were diagnosed in 21 patients (40%) and radiation injury in 31 patients (60%). Forty-two textural features were calculated on both unfiltered and filtered CE-MRI and summed FET PET images (20-40 min p.i.), using the software LIFEx. After feature selection, logistic regression models using a maximum of five features to avoid overfitting were calculated for each imaging modality separately and for the combined FET PET/MRI features. The resulting models were validated using cross-validation. Diagnostic accuracies were calculated for each imaging modality separately as well as for the combined model. Result(s): For the differentiation between radiation injury and recurrence of brain metastasis, textural features extracted from CE-MRI had a diagnostic accuracy of 81% (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 90%). FET PET textural features revealed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy of 83% (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 75%). However, the highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained when combining CE-MRI and FET PET features (accuracy, 89%; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 96%). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that combined FET PET/CE-MRI radiomics using textural feature analysis offers a great potential to contribute significantly to the management of patients with brain metastases.Copyright © 2018 The Authors",Excluded
1966,"Effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography to assess patency in gastrointestinal tracts with a patency capsule. BACKGROUND/AIMS: A patency capsule (PC) is used to safely perform capsule endoscopy. When the PC is not excreted within the defined time frame, radiography often cannot localize the PC. Computed tomography (CT) localizes a PC more definitively than radiography. We evaluated the localization of PCs using low-dose (LD)-CT., METHODOLOGY: Forty-nine patients received a PC and 33 did not excrete the PC within the defined time frame and underwent radiography and LDCT with a 90% exposure reduction., RESULTS: LDCT localized the PC in 31 patients (93.9%), whereas radiography localized it in 7 (21.2%), indicating a significantly higher detection rate with LDCT (P<0.0001). PC retention in the small intestine was confirmed by LDCT in 4 patients. Retention was not observed during capsule endoscopy in the patients with confirmed patency of the gastrointestinal tract. In 21 patients who underwent LDCT with the conventional photographing area, the effective radiographic exposure dose associated with LDCT was 1.43+/-1.08 mSv. Conversely, in the 12 patients who underwent LDCT with a reduced photographing area, the effective dose was reduced to 0.62+/-0.27 mSv (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: LDCT with a reduced exposure dose can definitively localize a PC. Therefore, this method may allow capsule endoscopy to be performed for more diseases.",Excluded

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare intravenous pyelography (IVP) and combined unenhanced and excretory phase multidetector-row CT (MDCT) with respect to image quality, diagnostic certainty and diagnostic concordance with the final clinical diagnosis in patients with painless microhematuria., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unenhanced MDCT, IVP and excretory phase MDCT were performed in 59 consecutive patients (21 women, 38 men, mean age 56 +/- 19 years, range 23 - 83 years) with painless microhematuria of unknown origin during a single examination with a single contrast media application (100 ml, non-ionic iodinated contrast media). Images were assessed by two experienced urogenital radiologists in consensus for image quality, diagnostic certainty of stone detection, obstruction, parenchymal lesions and morphological distinctive features. Imaging diagnoses of MDCT and IVP were compared with the final clinical diagnoses. In case of failure to detect an relevant pathology, the final clinical diagnosis was established after a mean follow-up period of 18 +/- 6 months (10 months to 2 years). Costs and radiation exposure of IVP and MDCT were compared., RESULTS: MDCT scan performed better than IVP in terms of image quality for all regarded variables. Image quality of MDCT was rated in all parameters as very good or good; the image quality of IVP differed in a wide range. MDCT and IVP reached a sensitivity of 100 % and 50 % for stone detection (n = 14, p = 0.008), respectively. Two bladder stones were not detected by IVU but correctly seen with MDCT. MDCT and IVP were unsatisfactory for detecting transitional cell carcinomas (n = 4, 2 of 4 detected with MDCT, 0 of 4 detected with IVU). One false positive transitional cell carcinoma was detected with IVP, none with MDCT. Additional relevant pathological changes (one teratoma, one abdominal aortic aneurysma and one abscess) were detected using MDCT but missed with IVP. In 38 of 59 patients (64 %) imaging and clinical follow-up over up to 24 months did not reveal any pathology to explain the microhematuria. The costs of the IVP (283 Euro) were lower compared with non-enhanced MDCT (380 Euro) or combined non-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MDCT (560 Euro). The radiation exposure was 23 - 27 mSv for MDCT and 2.3 mSv for IVP., CONCLUSION: MDCT performed better regarding image quality, subjective diagnostic certainty and diagnostic results with respect to stone detection. Since urolithiasis is a frequent cause of painless microhematuria MDCT is recommended as the initial imaging modality rather than IVU.",Excluded
824,"Change of cathepsin K activity in human skin in vivo after chronic ultraviolet damage. Objective: Photoaging is histologically characterized by the accumulation of abnormal elastin-containing material and disorganization of decreased bundles of collagen fibers. The fundamental mechanisms are still poorly understood. So far, most of the photoaging studies are focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It was described that cathepsin K (catK) might play an important role in mediating intracellular elastin degradation.We hypothesize that catK may be related to ECM homeostasis in photoaging. We therefore studied the activity of catK in human skin in response to chronic SSR. Method(s): Eight healthy Chinese volunteers (4 males and 4 females) were enrolled in the study after signing an informed consent that was approved by the medical ethics committee in our hospital ([2009]2-2). They were 21 to 26 years old with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III or IV. The untanned upper buttock region was used as the site for exposure. The random side of upper buttock region was exposed to 1 MED of SSR (spectrum of 290-400 nm, 30% UVA + 70% UVB) per exposure every day for 5 successive days/week for 6 weeks. The other side of the upper buttock received no irradiation as control.The specific cathepsin K substrate, z-Leu-Arg-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin, was used. The fluorescence which the cleavage product emitted was recorded at 360 nm. The activity of catK was determined by the intensity of the fluorescence. All measurements were done in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined by using the paired samples t test. Calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0. Statistical significance was set at P<.05. Result(s): Chronic SSR exposure for 6 weeks induced a significant clinical and histologic change of chronic photodamage. The result showed that the average activity of the SSR-induced group was (8.09 +/- 5.22) 3 10-3 (nmol/mg * min) while that of the control group was (117.54 +/-39.01) x10-3 (nmol/mg * min). These data suggest that catK activity of the SSR-induced skin was obviously decreased compared to the normal control skin (P<.001). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that catK is related to photoaging, probably the process of solar elastosis.We propose that the decrease of catK activity might lead to a decline of elastin degradation and subsequent accumulation of elastin in the extracellular space.",Excluded
67,"Absence of radiographic progression of hip arthritis during infliximab treatment for ankylosing spondylitis. This study aims to examine the impact of long-term treatment with the anti-TNF antibody infliximab on radiographic progression of hip arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis. Anteroposterior X-rays of the pelvis obtained at baseline from consecutive patients with ankylosing spondylitis and bilateral hip arthritis were compared with X-rays obtained after 6 +/- 2.5 years (mean +/- SD) of continuous infliximab treatment. Analysis was performed by the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Radiology Hip Index (BASRI-h) scoring system (min 0, max 4). Hip joint space width was also assessed by the average of measurements at three distinct sites between the acetabulum and femoral head. In 23 patients with active disease (21 men, mean age and disease duration of 45 and 16 years, respectively), the BASRI-h score at baseline was 1 in 7, 2 in 16, 3 in 16, and 4 in 7 hips (including two arthroplasties). Individual BASRI-h scores at baseline (2.50 +/- 0.86, mean +/- SD) remained unchanged in all patients at end of follow-up. At baseline, the average width of the whole joint space (3.56 +/- 0.70 mm, n = 44) was not associated with disease activity measurements but negatively correlated with BAS functional index (Spearman r = -0.5, P = 0.007). After 2-10 years of infliximab treatment, the average width of the whole joint space in these patients (3.59 +/- 0.79 mm) was not reduced. These results suggest that radiographic progression of hip arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis may be arrested during infliximab treatment.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of the spine provides superior tumor control, but vertebral compression fractures are increased and the pathophysiological process underneath is not well understood. Data on histopathological changes, particularly after salvage SBRT (sSBRT) following conventional irradiation, are scarce., OBJECTIVE: To investigate surgical specimens after sSBRT and primary SBRT (pSBRT) regarding histopathological changes., METHODS: We assessed 704 patients treated with spine SBRT 2006 to 2012. Thirty patients underwent salvage surgery; 23 histopathological reports were available. Clinical and histopathological findings were analyzed for sSBRT (69.6%) and pSBRT (30.4%)., RESULTS: Mean time to surgery after sSBRT/pSBRT was 8.3/10.3 mo (P = .64). Reason for surgery included pain (sSBRT/pSBRT: 12.5%/71.4%, P = .25), fractures (sSBRT/pSBRT: 37.5%/28.6%, P = .68), and neurological symptoms (sSBRT/pSBRT: 68.8%/42.9%, P = .24). Radiological tumor progression after sSBRT/pSBRT was seen in 71.4%/42.9% (P = .2). Most specimens displayed viable/proliferative tumor (sSBRT/pSBRT: 62.5%/71.4%, P = .68 and 56.3%/57.1%, P = .97). Few specimens showed soft tissue necrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 20%/28.6%, P = .66), osteonecrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 14.3%/16.7%, P = .89), or bone marrow fibrosis (sSBRT/pSBRT: 42.9%/33.3%, P = .69). Tumor bed necrosis was more common after sSBRT (81.3%/42.9%, P = .066). Radiological tumor progression correlated with viable/proliferative tumor (P = .03/P = .006) and tumor bed necrosis (P = .03). Fractures were increased with bone marrow fibrosis (P = .07), but not with osteonecrosis (P = .53) or soft tissue necrosis (P = .19). Neurological symptoms were common with radiological tumor progression (P = .07), but not with fractures (P = .18)., CONCLUSION: For both, sSBRT and pSBRT, histopathological changes were similar. Neurological symptoms were attributable to tumor progression and pathological fractures were not associated with osteonecrosis or tumor progression.",Excluded

Background The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative complications and nutritional status between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in patients who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy, and assess the advantages of both surgical procedures. Methods Between 2010 and 2018, 47 cases underwent proximal gastrectomy with esophagogastrostomy (n = 23) or double-tract reconstruction (n = 24) at our institu-tion for the treatment of clinical T1N0 adenocarcinoma located in the upper third of the stomach. Patient clinical characteristics, short-term outcomes, nutrition status, and skeletal muscle index were compared among the two groups. Results There was no significant difference between esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction in terms of operation time, blood loss, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Reflux symptoms and anastomotic stenosis were significantly higher in the esophagogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). There was no significant difference in anastomotic leakage, surgical site infection, and pancre-atic fistula. For the nutritional status, the decrease rate of cholinesterase was significantly higher in the esopha-gogastrostomy group compared with the double-tract reconstruction group at 6 months (P = 0.008) There was no significant difference in the decrease rate of skeletal muscle mass index at 1 year after surgery. Conclusion Compared with esophagogastrostomy, double-tract reconstruction tends to have better short-term nutritional status and postoperative outcomes in terms of preventing the occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and anastomosis stenosis. These findings suggest that double-tract reconstruction may be a useful method in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy.Copyright © 2020 Tottori University Medical Press.",Excluded
1960,"Iterative reconstruction and individualized automatic tube current selection reduce radiation dose while maintaining image quality in 320-multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography. Aim To assess the effect of two iterative reconstruction algorithms (AIDR and AIDR3D) and individualized automatic tube current selection on radiation dose and image quality in computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA). Materials and methods In a single-centre cohort study, 942 patients underwent electrocardiogram-gated CTCA using a 320-multidetector CT system. Images from group 1 (n = 228) were reconstructed with a filtered back projection algorithm (Quantum Denoising Software, QDS+). Iterative reconstruction was used for group 2 (AIDR, n = 379) and group 3 (AIDR3D, n = 335). Tube current was selected based on body mass index (BMI) for groups 1 and 2, and selected automatically based on scout image attenuation for group 3. Subjective image quality was graded on a four-point scale (1 = excellent, 4 = non-diagnostic). Results There were no differences in age (p = 0.975), body mass index (p = 0.435), or heart rate (p = 0.746) between the groups. Image quality improved with iterative reconstruction and automatic tube current selection [1.3 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.2-1.4), 1.2 (1.1-1.2) and 1.1 (1-1.2) respectively; p < 0.001] and radiation dose decreased [274 (260-290), 242 (230-253) and 168 (156-180) mGy cm, respectively; p < 0.001]. Conclusion The application of the latest iterative reconstruction algorithm and individualized automatic tube current selection can substantially reduce radiation dose whilst improving image quality in CTCA. © 2013 The Royal College of Radiologists.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from patients (n=203) with UICC stage II and III rectal adenocarcinomas, who underwent low anterior or abdominoperineal resection and received post-operative or pre-operative radiochemotherapy from January 1989 until July 2002. The rates of survival and distant and local recurrences were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards (median follow-up 8 years). Multivariate analysis was used to assess the prognostic value of CEA and CA 19-9.
RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates for patients with normal (n =118) and elevated (n=88) CEA values were as follows: overall survival 62.4% and 32.0% (p<0.001), local control 73.5% and 55.0% (p=0.007), and absence of distant metastasis 83.3% and 88.0% (n.s.), respectively. Similar results were obtained for patients with normal (n=82) and elevated (n = 10) CA 19-9 values: overall survival 60.7% and 14.0% (p=0.007), local control 83.7% and 80.0% (n.s.), and absence of distant metastasis 64.9% and 75.0% (n.s.), respectively. After adjustment for TNM stage, sex, age, LDH, tumor site and grading, the elevation of CEA proved to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (relative risk of 1.01 per ng/ml, CI 1.002 - 1.01; p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the prognostic value of pre-radiotherapy CEA and CA 19-9 in patients with stage II or III rectal carcinoma.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The incidence of postflight orthostatic intolerance after short-duration spaceflight is about 20%. However, the incidence after long-duration spaceflight was unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that orthostatic intolerance is more severe after long-duration than after short-duration flight., METHODS: We performed tilt tests on six astronauts before and after long-duration (129-190 days) spaceflights and compared these data with data obtained during stand tests before and after previous short-duration missions., RESULTS: Five of the six astronauts studied became presyncopal during tilt testing after long-duration flights. Only one had become presyncopal during stand testing after short-duration flights. We also compared the long-duration flight tilt test data to tilt test data from 20 different astronauts who flew on the short-duration Shuttle missions that delivered and recovered the astronauts to and from the Mir Space Station. Five of these 20 astronauts became presyncopal on landing day. Heart rate responses to tilt were no different between astronauts on long-duration flights and astronauts on short-duration flights, but long-duration subjects had lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs than short-duration presyncopal subjects, suggesting a possible decrease in cardiac contractile function. One subject had subnormal norepinephrine release with upright posture after the long flight but not after the short flight. Plasma volume losses were not greater after long flights., CONCLUSION: Long-duration spaceflight markedly increases orthostatic intolerance, probably with multiple contributing factors.",Excluded
2478,"Superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging for early and late radiation-induced hepatic injuries. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MRI was performed in twenty-one patients undergoing proton-beam radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinomas. Patients were divided into two groups: early and late phase hepatic injuries. Each group was investigated 3 to 9 weeks and 4 to 65 months after the start of irradiation, respectively. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2*-weighted images were obtained before and after SPIO administration. In all postcontrast sequences in the early phase, irradiated livers demonstrated relatively higher intensity than nonirradiated livers and the radiation-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) was improved. Postcontrast T2*-weighted images showed the highest C/N. In the late phase, the irradiated areas showed high intensity on T2-weighted images and low intensity on T1-weighted images without SPIO, while high intensity on T1-weighted images with SPIO. The C/N increased with SPIO in all sequences and postcontrast T2-weighted images showed the highest C/N in the late phase. SPIO-enhanced MRI is useful to evaluate this entity both in the early and late phase of clinical studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded

Purpose: The purpose of this work was to compare the image quality and radiation dose delivered to patients during computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) of the supra-aortic arteries using two single-source (SS) and two dual-energy (DE) CT scanners. Material(s) and Method(s): In this retrospective study, 120 patients who underwent CTA of supra-aortic arteries were studied using four different types of CT scanners: a sixteen and forty-detector-row SS and two DE CT scanners. Seventy milliters of contrast medium were injected at a flow rate of 4 mL/s using a power injector. For each patient the dose-length product (DLP), the volume computed tomography dose index (CDTIvol), the length of the scan and the effective dose (ED) were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative [image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)] image quality assessment was performed. Result(s): A statistically significant lower value of the DE compared to the SS technology (P < 0.0001) for the CDTI, DLP and ED was found, whereas we did not find any statistically significant difference between the four scanners for the measurements of the image noise, SNR and CNR.

Introduction: To advise laryngeal carcinoma patients on the most appropriate form of treatment, a tool to predict survival and local control is needed. Material(s) and Method(s): We performed a population-based cohort study on 994 laryngeal carcinoma patients, treated with RT from 1977 until 2008. Two nomograms were developed and validated. Performance of the models is expressed as the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Result(s): Unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival were low hemoglobin level, male sex, high T-status, nodal involvement, older age, lower EQD2T (total radiation dose corrected for fraction dose and overall treatment time), and non-glottic tumor. All factors except tumor location were prognostic for local control. The AUCs were 0.73 for overall survival and 0.67 for local control. External validation of the survival model yielded AUCs of 0.68, 0.74, 0.76 and 0.71 for the Leuven (n = 109), the VU Amsterdam (n = 178), the Manchester (n = 403) and the NKI cohort (n = 205), respectively, while the validation procedure for the local control model resulted in AUCs of 0.70, 0.71, 0.72 and 0.62. The resulting nomograms were made available on the website www.predictcancer.org. Conclusion(s): For patients with a laryngeal carcinoma treated with RT alone, we have developed visual, easy-to-use nomograms for the prediction of overall survival and primary local control.

3216,"Coloproctologic disorders of the pelvic floor. Purpose. The aim of this review is to describe the most frequent and important coloproctologic pelvic floor disorders. Relevant diagnostic procedures of the pelvic floor will be presented. Material and methods. A host of diagnoses and symptoms such as the descending perineum syndrome, rectocele, cystocele, enterocele, uterine and vaginal descensus, anal and rectal prolaps, outlet obstruction, anismus, inertia recti and intussusception are included under the heading 'pelvic floor disorders'. Although symptoms are often varied, problems concerning urinary and/or faecal continence commonly lead to primary consultation of a physician. Results. Quite often, apparently divergent symptoms such as constipation and incontinence are simultaneously mentioned. A clear gender disposition is observed with female patients inflicted nine-fold in comparison to male patients. The primary consultant may belong to a variety of specialities such as urology, proctology, gynaecology or dermatology, depending upon the predominant symptom. A feeling of trust is essential for the treatment of a disorder involving highly intimate regions of the body. Discussion. An exact medical history and standardized proctologic evaluation consisting of inspection, palpation, rectoscopy and proctoscopy may be augmented by investigations such as anorectal manometry or endosonography. Conventional defecography has been replaced more and more by dynamic MRI of the pelvic floor in specialized institutions, enabling additional gynaecologic and urologic investigations avoiding ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Additionally, MRA signal intensity and arterial thickness in the anterior cerebral artery, middle cerebral artery, and basilar artery were lower in radiation-exposed mice than in control mice. MRI and MRA are useful tools for assessing brain and arterial abnormalities after prenatal exposure to radiation.Copyright © 2014 Japanese Teratology Society.",Excluded
762,"Computer-aided pulmonary nodule detection - performance of two CAD systems at different CT dose levels. PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of dose reduction on the performance of computer-aided lung nodule detection systems (CAD) of two manufacturers by comparing respective CAD results on ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) and standard dose CT (SD-CT)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) data sets of 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, patients 31 - 74 years old) were retrospectively selected for CAD analysis. Indication for CT examination was staging of a known primary malignancy or suspected pulmonary malignancy. CT images were consecutively acquired at 5 mAs (ULD-CT) and 75 mAs (SD-CT) with 120 kV tube voltage (1 mm slice thickness). The standard of reference was determined by three experienced readers in consensus. CAD reading algorithms (pre-commercial CAD system, Philips, Netherlands: CAD-1; LungCARE, Siemens, Germany: CAD-2) were applied to the CT data sets., RESULTS: Consensus reading identified 253 nodules on SD-CT and ULD-CT. Nodules ranged in diameter between 2 and 41 mm (mean diameter 4.8 mm). Detection rates were recorded with 72 % and 62 % (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 73 % and 56 % for ULD-CT. Median false positive rates per patient were calculated with 6 and 5 (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2) for SD-CT and with 8 and 3 for ULD-CT. After separate statistical analysis of nodules with diameters of 5 mm and greater, the detection rates increased to 83 % and 61 % for SD-CT and to 89 % and 67 % for ULD-CT (CAD-1 vs. CAD-2). For both CAD systems there were no significant differences between the detection rates for standard and ultra-low-dose data sets (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Dose reduction of the underlying CT scan did not significantly influence nodule detection performance of the tested CAD systems.",Excluded
3345,"Changes occurred in the testes and DNA pattern of males wax moth (Galleria mellonella) first generation as a result of irradiation of their parents. Nowadays, the sterile insect technique is broadly used as a pest control measure. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the alteration occurred in testes and DNA pattern as an effect of inherited sterility. Full grown pupae of the wax moth, Galleria mellonella were irradiated with 80 and 160 Gy of gamma irradiation. The size of the testes was decreased by increasing of gamma irradiation dose. Also, the size of the testes was decreased in F 1 males comparing with the size of the testes of both the parents and the untreated control. The effects of gamma rays on the DNA patterns of adult male parents and F 1 males showed alterations among the controls, the treated parents and F 1 individuals. Exposure to radiation caused very frequently the appearance of some extra bands and the deficiency of others in the arbitrary random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction amplification patterns of the irradiated insects.",Excluded
1580,"Parotid gland-recovery after radiotherapy in the head and neck region - 36 months follow-up of a prospective clinical study. Background: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the recovery potential of the parotid glands after using either 3D-conformal-radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by sparing one single parotid gland. Method(s): Between 06/2002 and 10/2008, 117 patients with head and neck cancer were included in this prospective, non-randomised clinical study. All patients were treated with curative intent. Salivary gland function was assessed by measuring stimulated salivary flow at the beginning, during and at the end of radiotherapy as well as 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment. Measurements were converted to flow rates and normalized relative to rates before treatment. Mean doses (Dmean) were calculated from dose-volume histograms based on computed tomographies of the parotid glands. Result(s): Patients were grouped according to the Dmean of the spared parotid gland having the lowest radiation exposure: Group I - Dmean < 26 Gy (n = 36), group II - Dmean 26-40 Gy (n = 45), and group III - Dmean > 40 Gy (n = 36). 15/117 (13%) patients received IMRT. By using IMRT as compared to 3D-CRT the Dmean of the spared parotid gland could be significantly reduced (Dmean IMRT vs. 3D-CRT: 21.7 vs. 34.4 Gy, p < 0.001). The relative salivary flow rates (RFSR) as a function of the mean parotid dose after 24 and 36 months was in group I 66% and 74%, in group II 56% and 49%, and in group III 31% and 24%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that the parotid gland dose and the tumor site were the independent determinants 12 and 36 months after the end of RT. Patients of group I and II parotid gland function did recover at 12, 24, and 36 months after the end of RT. Conclusion(s): If a Dmean < 26 Gy for at least one parotid gland can be achieved then this is sufficient to reach complete recovery of pre-RT salivary flow rates. The radiation volume which depends on tumor site did significantly impact on the Dmean of the parotids, and thus on the saliva flow and recovery of parotid gland.Copyright © 2011 Hey et al.",Excluded
2644,"Incidence of pseudoprogression in low-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy. Background: As the incidence of pseudo-progressive disease (psPD), or pseudoprogression, in low-grade glioma (LGG) is unknown, we retrospectively investigated this phenomenon in a cohort of LGG patients given radiotherapy (RT)., Methods: All MRI scans and clinical data from patients with histologically proven LGG treated with radiation between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. PsPD was scored when a new enhancing lesion occurred after RT and subsequently disappeared or remained stable for at least a year without therapy, including dexamethasone., Results: Sixty-three out of 71 patients who received RT for LGG were deemed eligible for evaluation of psPD. The median follow-up was 5 years (range 1-10 y). PsPD was seen in 13 patients (20.6%). PsPD occurred after a median of 12 months with a range of 3-78 months. The median duration of psPD was 6 months, with a range of 2-26 months and always occurred within the RT high dose fields of at least 45 Gy. The area of the enhancement at the time of psPD was significantly smaller compared with the area of enhancement during ""true"" progression (median size 54mm2 [range 12-340mm2] vs 270mm2 [range 30-3420mm2], respectively; P = .009)., Conclusions: PsPD occurs frequently in LGG patients receiving RT. This supports the policy to postpone a new line of treatment until progression is evident, especially when patients have small contrast enhancing lesions within the RT field.

BACKGROUND: Amifostine has a potential role for salivary gland protection in head and neck cancer patients who had radiotherapy., MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-seven head and neck cancer patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy or radiotherapy plus Amifostine. The efficacy of the treatment was determined by a questionnaire evaluating dryness of mouth and the oral comfort, the RTOG/EORTC acute/late radiation morbidity scoring criteria, collection of the whole saliva and the 99mTc-pertecnetate scintigraphy of the salivary glands., RESULTS: Amifostine significantly reduced the mean questionnaire scores from 6.49 to 3.73, the incidence of grade > or = 2 mucositis from 75% to 36% and acute xerostomia from 82% to 39%. The salivary gland function returned to normal at a rate of 36.3% in the Amifostine group versus 9.1% in the control group., CONCLUSION: Amifostine is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of acute mucositis, acute and late xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients.",Excluded
2475,"Preoperative radiotherapy contributes to induction of proliferative activity of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T-cells in oral squamous cell carcinoma. In order to evaluate host immune response to cancer, many methods have been applied. However, in the field of oral squamous cell carcinoma, evaluation of host immune response on the basis of proliferative activity of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TIL) has not been reported. Therefore, we applied double immunohistochemical staining of proliferation markers Ki-67 and CD8 to surgically resected and paraffin-embedded tissue sections for 35 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma. With this method, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of Ki-67+CD8+TIL and the intra-tumor epithelium infiltration rate of CD8+TIL (P=0.0237). In the process of analysis, we found that the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL tended to correlate (P=0.0859) with clinical N factor (lymph node metastasis), which was previously reported to suppress host immune response. We therefore assumed there was another factor inducing host immune response. The proliferative activity of CD8+TIL was well correlated with preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.0200) while there was no significant correlation between the proliferative activity of CD8+TIL and other clinical factors; age, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological N factor (P=0.5410, 0.7769, 0.1041, and 0.1072, respectively). Our present results strongly imply that preoperative radiotherapy is a very important factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma inducing host immune response regardless of the clinical factors present.",Excluded
1782,"Hemostatic radiation therapy for malignant tumorsda retrospective analysis of bleeding resolution rate. Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate if hemostatic radiation therapy was effective in resolving the bleeding and to analyze the factors associated with treatment success. Materials/Methods: Records from patients treated with hemostatic radiation therapy between May 2012 and May 2014 in a single institution were reviewed. The endpoints analyzed were: initial bleeding control rate, re-bleeding incidence and final bleeding control (after salvage treatment of initial treatment failures or re-bleeding). Biological equivalent dose (BED) was categorized (<30 Gy10 vs >/Z 30 Gy10). The statistics were done using Kaplan-Meier representation of re-bleeding events in time and Fisher Exact test as hypothesis test for categorical variables using SPSS V2.0 software. The study was previously approved by IRB. Result(s): In total, eighty patients were treated during the period studied. Information concerning symptom response was available for 72 of 80 patients. The overall initial bleeding control rate was 81.9% (59/72). It was 85.7% (12/14), 100% (4/4), 76.5% (13/17), 78.3% (18/23), 77.8% (7/9), and 100% (5/5) in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. Re-bleeding incidence was 25.4% (15/59) of the patients with initial bleeding control, and when it occurred the median time was 8 weeks after the irradiation (range: 1 e 96 weeks). With salvage treatment, the final bleeding control was 64.3%, 100%, 76.5%, 78.3%, 75%, and 100% in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. BED less than 30 Gy10 was not associated with a significant lower control (75.6% vs 92.3%, P = 0.113). Treatment interruptions due to death or worsening of clinical condition (8 cases) were more common in schedules with more than 5 fractions (20% vs 4%, P = 0.047). Conclusion(s): Independently of the fractionation used, radiation therapy was effective in resolving the bleeding from malignant tumors in the urgency scenario, with more than 80% of resolution. However, the probability of treatment discontinuation was greater with the use of more protracted schedules (more than five fractions).",Excluded
1557,"Glypican-3-mediated inhibition of CD26 by TFPI: a novel mechanism in hematopoietic stem cell homing and maintenance. Directional migration determines hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) homing, which depends upon the interaction between the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4. CD26 is a widely expressed membrane-bound ectopeptidase that cleaves CXCL12 thereby depleting its chemokine activity. We identified tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as a biological inhibitor of CD26 in murine and human HSPCs. We observed low-level TFPI expression in endothelial cells in the bone marrow (BM), which did not increase following radiation injury. Treatment of HSPCs with TFPI in vitro led to enhanced HSPC migration toward CXCL12, as well as homing and engraftment in the BM upon transplantation. We found that Glypican-3 (GPC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on murine as well as human HSPCs, mediated this effect. TFPI did not affect CD26 activity, migration, or homing of GPC3(-/-) HSPCs, while it affected GPC1(-/-) HSPCs similar to wild-type HSPCs. Moreover, proliferation of GPC3(-/-) but not GPC1(-/-) BM HSPCs was significantly increased, which was associated with a decrease in the primitive HSC pool in BM and an increase in proportion of the circulating HSPCs in the peripheral blood. Hence, we present a novel role for TFPI and GPC3 in regulating HSC homing as well as retention in the BM.",Excluded
2413,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices. We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded

2257,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes). A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded
961,"Dynamic CT for Parathyroid Adenoma Detection: How Does Radiation Dose Compare With Nuclear Medicine?. OBJECTIVE: Dynamic CT is increasingly used for preoperative localization of parathyroid adenomas, but concerns remain about the radiation effective dose of CT compared with that of 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy. The purpose of this study was to compare the radiation dose delivered by three-phase dynamic CT with that delivered by 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performed in accordance with our current protocols and to assess the possible reduction in effective dose achieved by decreasing the scan length (i.e., z-axis) of two phases of the dynamic CT protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effective dose of a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine parathyroid study performed with and without coregistration CT was calculated and compared with the effective dose of our current three-phase dynamic CT protocol as well as a proposed protocol involving CT with reduced scan length., RESULTS: The median effective dose for a 99mTc-sestamibi nuclear medicine study was 5.6 mSv. This increased to 12.4 mSv with the addition of coregistration CT, which is higher than the median effective dose of 9.3 mSv associated with the dynamic CT protocol. Reducing the scan length of two phases in the dynamic CT protocol could reduce the median effective dose to 6.1 mSv, which would be similar to that of the dose from the 99mTc-sestamibi study alone., CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT used for the detection of parathyroid adenoma can deliver a lower radiation dose than 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT/CT. It may be possible to reduce the dose further by decreasing the scan length of two of the phases, although whether this has an impact on accuracy of the localization needs further investigation.",Excluded

Kerma area product (KAP) was used as a measure of x-ray exposure to the patient. Mean KAP value per procedure was 79+/-50 Gy cm for PTA, 139+/-55 Gy cm for TIPS, 110+/-44 Gy cm for DA, 325+/-145 Gy cm for AE, and 150+/-76 Gy cm for HCE. Forty-six percent of total KAP value was attributed to fluoroscopy. In conclusion, we showed that a linear correlation between effective dose and KAP was found (r=0.84), which could be used for estimating patient effective dose using KAP measurements. Small changes to the number of digital frames acquired result in substantial change of the total KAP in interventional radiological procedures. Stochastic risk from IR procedures is quite low for the patient. Measuring KAP is a simple and accurate method, which provides the interventional radiologist with a good estimation of the patient's relative risk for stochastic effects.",Excluded

A dose of 7 mL was used for each of 3 acquisitions: images were obtained of each foot in the sagittal plane, and then both feet were imaged simultaneously in the transverse plane. The following parameters were used for acquisition: (TR/TE 4.7 milliseconds/ 1.3 milliseconds, field of view = 28 cm, Flip angle = 30 degrees, 384 x 256 matrix, section thickness = 1.6 mm, Bandwidth = 19.23). The dorsalis pedis, plantar arch, distal posterior tibial, lateral tarsal, and medial plantar arteries were graded for visualization, artifact, and overall image quality on a 4-point scale (1 = worst; 4 = best)., RESULTS: Superior visualization trended towards separate sagittal acquisitions when compared with that of bilateral transverse acquisitions for most of the individual vessels of the foot. Overall, separate sagittal acquisitions (average score = 2.9) were superior to bilateral transverse acquisitions (average score = 2.6). The average image quality score reflecting the amount of artifact was 2.6 for studies obtained using bilateral transverse acquisitions and 3.1 for studies obtained using separate sagittal acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Low-dose gadolinium multi-injection TRICKS and bolus-chase MR angiography at 3.0 T provides an effective and easily reproducible technique for imaging of the pedal vasculature in volunteers and has great potential for clinical application.",Excluded

Thyroid cancer patients treated with high-dose radioactive iodine (3.7-7.4 GBq) are different from other people because after the administration, the radionuclide I-131 is excreted via urine, feces, saliva and breathing, and also via exposure to other patients. Caregivers of the patient may receive higher radiation doses than normal. The purposes of this study were to estimate the total effective dose equivalent from internal and external exposure to caregivers of patients treated with high dose I-131 admitted at Siriraj Hospital, and to compare the estimated dose with the dose constraint of 5 mSv per annum for caregivers.

Purpose: 131I radiation-induced sialadenitis is the most frequent complication of 131I treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma, but little is known about 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the clinical and sialographic imaging features of 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis to 131I radiation-induced parotitis. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients with 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis. Clinical records and sialographic image features were evaluated. The predictor variables included age at the time of diagnosis, gender, course of the disease, site of symptoms, and sialographic image grades. The outcome variable was the location of sialadenitis. A student t-test was conducted to analyze the associations between predictor variables and the outcome. Result(s): The sample was composed of 4 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis (100% female), 28 with parotitis (85.7% female), and 1 with submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (P <.05). The occurrence of bilateral glands dysfunction was less often in submandibular glands (SMG: 1/4; PG: 19/28). The age and course of disease were not different between submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (Age, SMG: 46.00 +/- 13.59 years; PG: 50.04 +/- 10.71 years, P >.05; Course of the disease, SMG: 11.00 +/- 16.69 months; PG: 6.96 +/- 11.18 months, P >.05). Radiographically, 7 of 16 patients with parotitis were identified as grade 2 and 9 patients as grade 3. In 3 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis, 1 patient was identified as grade 2 and 2 patients as grade 3. The postoperative pathological results showed that the proliferation of glandular tissue from the hilum of the submandibular gland caused duct stenosis. Conclusion(s): The results suggest 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis has a lower incidence compared with parotitis and 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis might be related to duct stenosis caused by proliferative glandular tissue after 131I radiation treatment.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded

Aim(s): This study evaluate the correlation between the apparent lateral deviation of the sesamoids on anteroposterior X-rays and their rotation on axial X-rays, then evaluates their relations with the severity of hallux valgus. Method(s): This monocentric retrospective study included feet of adult men and women with a HV angle (HVA) superior to 15 degrees. Two independent doctors made the measurement of the relative displacement of the sesamoids on anteroposterior radiographies by using the 7 grades Clapham-and-Hardy classification and compared it with their rotation in axial radiographies, defined by the sesamoid rotation angle and the tibia sesamoid grade on modified Meary incidence with radio-transparent heelpiece. Correlation with the HV severity was analyzed based on measure of HVA and first intermetatarsal angle. Result(s): 303 feet were included (201 patients). All parameters shown significant correlations between each other. SRA appeared to be the most reliable criteria on Me ary radiography to evaluate the relative lateral displacement of sesamoids and it was the most strongly correlated to the HVA (0.658). Conclusion(s): An anteroposterior radiographic incidence is not sufficient to evaluate sesamoids subluxation. To approach at best the triplanar deformity of the metatarso-sesamoid complex, an evaluation in frontal and axial incidence is necessary. SRA appears as reliable criteria and could be used to evaluate the quality of the corrective surgery.",Excluded

Tumour stage was Kadish B in 7 & Kadish C in 11 patients. Cervical lymphadenopathy was noted in 4 patients at presentation. Common symptoms included epistaxis in 50%; nasal obstruction, proptosis & visual dimness in 27.77% each & nasal mass in 16.66% patients. 11/18 patients underwent surgery. Radiotherapy was used in all patients-16 with radical intent (median dose 60 Gy; range45-70 Gy) & 2 with palliative intent (range 8-30 Gy/1-10fractions). Radiation plan was 2 dimensional using telecobalt in 2 patients & 3 dimensional using megavoltage X-rays in 16 patients. Treatment volume encompassed the gross tumour with a safety margin of 1-2 cm. Neck was addressed in patients with involved nodes. Common field arrangement included 2 anterior oblique or anterolateral or superior & inferior vetex beams. Chemotherapy was used in the following setting: neoadjuvant in 10 patients (common regimens CAPcyclophosphamide, adriamycin & cisplatin; EP-etoposide & cisplatin; VACvincristine, actinomycinD, cyclophosphamide), concurrent in 3 patients with weekly cisplatin & adjuvant in 5 patients with EP regimen. 7 patients had died at last follow-up with causes being local recurrence in 2, nodal recurrence in 2, distant dissemination in 3 (metastases in bone, brain & chest wall respectively), disease persistence in1 & unknown in 1. After a median follow-up of 14.43 months, 2 year overall survival & progressionfree survival were respectively 62%+/-13% & 49.7+/-14%. Conclusion(s): Management of esthesioneuroblastoma poses clinical challenge due to rarity, complex topography of disease, morbidity of extensive surgery and absence of well defined treatment protocols. Our institutional results are modest and clinical management has been quite heterogenous. In future treatment guidelines need to be framed - surgery alone for Kadish A tumour, surgery with post-operative radiation in Kadish B tumour & multimodality management- surgery (craniofacial resection) followed by chemoradiation in Kadish C tumour. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy merits trial in Kadish C tumours which are upfront unresectable.",Excluded
929,"Effects of laser irradiation on arthritic histopathology and heat shock protein 70 expression in C57 black mice with osteoarthritis. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of three different laser treatments (650 nm alone, 10.6 mum alone and combined laser of 650 nm and 10.6 mum) on experimental osteoarthritis of the knees in C57 black mice., METHODS: Sixty C57 black mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded
1640,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for oligo-recurrent lung metastases from colorectal cancer: A feasibility study. Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for oligo-recurrent lung tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC). Method(s): From May 1997 to October 2012, 34 consecutive patients with oligo-recurrent pulmonary metastases from CRC were treated with CIRT. The patients were not surgical candidates for medical reasons or patient refusal. Using a respiratory-gated technique, carbon ion therapy was delivered with curative intent using 4 coplanar beam angles. A median dose of 60 GyE (range, 44-64.8 GyE) was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV), with a median daily dose of 15 GyE (range, 3.6-44 GyE). Treatment outcome was analyzed in terms of local control rate (LCR), survival rate, and treatment-related complications. Result(s): In total, 34 patients with 44 oligo-recurrent pulmonary lesions were treated with CIRT. Median follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 2- and 3-year actuarial LCRs of the treated patients were 85.4% +/- 6.2% and 85.4% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Overall survival was 65.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 years, and 50.1% +/- 10.5% at 3 years. Although survival rates were relatively worse in the subsets of patients aged < 63 years or with early metastasis (< 36 months after resection of primary site), these factors were not significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). All treatment-related complications were self-limited, without any grade 3-5 toxicity. Conclusion(s): CIRT is one of the most effective nonsurgical treatments for colorectal lung metastases, which are relatively resistant to stereotactic body radiotherapy. CIRT is considered to be the least invasive approach even in patients who have undergone repeated prior thoracic metastasectomies. © 2014 Takahashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance and complications of C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT)-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PCNB) in 1108 patients. Material(s) and Method(s): This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board. From January 2009 to December 2011, 1108 patients (633 males and 475 females; mean age, 62.4 years+/-12.3; range 9-89 years) with 1110 pulmonary lesions (mean size, 2.7 cm+/-1.7; range 0.5-13.0 cm) underwent 1153 CBCTguided PCNB with or without virtual navigation guidance. Diagnostic performance, complication rate, and radiation dose of CBCT-guided PCNB were investigated. Variables influencing the diagnostic performance and complication were assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Result(s): 1153 PCNBs, histologic specimens were successfully obtained in 1148 PCNBs (99.6%); 767 malignant (66.5%), 314 benign (27.2%), and 67 indeterminate (5.8%). Pulmonary lesions were correctly diagnosed in 1050 PCNBs and were incorrectly diagnosed in 31 PCNBs. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CBCT-guided PCNB was 96.0% (736/767), 100% (314/314), and 97.1% (1050/1081), respectively. Lesions in the lower lobe (odds ratio (OR), 2.956; P=0.013) and lesion <=1 cm (OR, 2.427; P=0.021) were significant risk factors for diagnostic failure (31 PCNBs with false negatives and 5 with inadequate samplings). As for complications, pneumothorax and hemoptysis occurred in 196 (17.0%) and 80 (6.9%) procedures, respectively. However there were no severe complications such as mortality or air embolism. As for influencing factors for complications, pleural passage >=2 (OR, 4.998; P<0.001) and emphysema along the needle pathway (OR, 2.612; P<0.001) were the two most significant risk factors for pneumothorax, and ground-glass nodules (OR, 4.188; P<0.001) were the most significant risk factor for hemoptysis. The mean radiation exposure during the procedures was 7.3 mSv+/-3.8 (range, 0.7-15.3 mSv). Conclusion(s): CBCT-guided PCNB is a safe and highly accurate diagnostic method of pulmonary lesions. Clinical Implication: CBCT-guided PCNB with its real-time capability and CT function has been shown to be highly accurate and safe in a large clinical population and thus can be considered an established method for tissue sampling in clinical practice.",Excluded
3520,"Multiple cervical lymph node involvement and extra-capsular extension predict for contralateral nodal recurrence after ipsilateral radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil. Background: Ipsilateral radiotherapy is an established technique for treating well-lateralised tonsillar tumours. Concerns exist regarding the risk of contralateral nodal failure, particularly in patients with ipsilateral nodal involvement at presentation. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy aiming to identify factors that predispose to a higher risk of contralateral nodal recurrence. Method(s): Retrospective case note review of all patients with tonsillar cancer who were treated using ipsilateral radiotherapy between September 1995 and September 2011 was performed. Demographics, T and N stage, involvement of soft palate and/or tongue base, presence of extra-capsular spread (ECS) and treatment details were recorded. Kaplan-Meier curves for treatment outcomes were generated. Result(s): A total of 136 patients were identified. Median follow-up was 4.2 years. Twelve (9%) patients had loco-regional recurrence. Eight patients (6%) had contralateral recurrence. N2b disease, ECS and number of pack-years of smoking were associated with contralateral nodal recurrence. Five-year overall survival was 89%, loco-regional disease-free survival 90%, disease-free survival 86% and distal recurrence-free survival 96%. Conclusion(s): N2b disease, ECS and a greater than 10 pack-year smoking history are risk factors for contralateral nodal recurrence in well-lateralised tonsillar cancers. Prophylactic irradiation of the contralateral neck should be recommended in this group of patients.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1895,"Oral green tea catechin metabolites are incorporated into human skin and protect against UV radiation-induced cutaneous inflammation in association with reduced production of pro-inflammatory eicosanoid 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Green tea catechins (GTC) reduce UV radiation (UVR)-induced inflammation in experimental models, but human studies are scarce and their cutaneous bioavailability and mechanism of photoprotection are unknown. We aimed to examine oral GTC cutaneous uptake, ability to protect human skin against erythema induced by a UVR dose range and impact on potent cyclo-oxygenase- and lipoxygenase-produced mediators of UVR inflammation, PGE2 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), respectively. In an open oral intervention study, sixteen healthy human subjects (phototype I/II) were given low-dose GTC (540 mg) with vitamin C (50 mg) daily for 12 weeks. Pre- and post-supplementation, the buttock skin was exposed to UVR and the resultant erythema quantified. Skin blister fluid and biopsies were taken from the unexposed and the UVR-exposed skin 24 h after a pro-inflammatory UVR challenge (three minimal erythema doses). Urine, skin tissue and fluid were analysed for catechin content and skin fluid for PGE2 and 12-HETE by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem MS. A total of fourteen completing subjects were supplement compliant (twelve female, median 42.5 years, range 29-59 years). Benzoic acid levels were increased in skin fluid post-supplementation (P= 0.03), and methylated gallic acid and several intact catechins and hydroxyphenyl-valerolactones were detected in the skin tissue and fluid. AUC analysis for UVR erythema revealed reduced response post-GTC (P= 0.037). Pre-supplementation, PGE2 and 12-HETE were UVR induced (P= 0.003, 0.0001). After GTC, UVR-induced 12-HETE reduced from mean 64 (sd 42) to 41 (sd 32) pg/mul (P= 0.01), while PGE2 was unaltered. Thus, GTC intake results in the incorporation of catechin metabolites into human skin associated with abrogated UVR-induced 12-HETE; this may contribute to protection against sunburn inflammation and potentially longer-term UVR-mediated damage.",Excluded
1632,"Transesophageal echocardiography to diagnose anomalous right coronary artery type R2A in dogs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) as an alternative to angiography for the diagnosis of R2A coronary artery (CA) abnormalities., ANIMALS: Twenty-two dogs with a diagnosis of type R2A CA anomaly were reviewed/analyzed., METHODS: A retrospective study of case records. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), angiography, and follow-up investigations of pulmonic stenosis (PS) with R2A CA were carried out to compare different diagnostic methods., RESULTS: Based on the TTE morphology, PS with an aberrant CA was suspected in all dogs (n = 22) and later confirmed by angiography in 18 cases (18/22), and necropsy in two cases (2/22). In 12 cases (12/22), TEE and angiography were both performed and confirmed the diagnosis of an R2A anomaly. Two cases (2/22) were diagnosed only with TEE., CONCLUSIONS: Transesophageal echocardiography may be considered an effective tool to diagnose CA abnormalities, in particular when TTE is inconclusive. Transesophageal echocardiography offers detailed and easily reproducible views of coronary ostia, and the spatial relationship between the right common CA and the great arteries. Although it is not possible to define the course of the more distal coronary branches, TEE has proven reliable in recognizing those elements that can constitute a risk for the execution of a balloon valvuloplasty (BV). Therefore, TEE can be used to confirm this type of CA anomaly and prevent a BV, which is contraindicated in these cases. In addition, TEE avoids any further vascular access, radiation exposure, and contrast medium injection. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2611,"Loss of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 causes increased tumour latency in p53-deficient mice. PARP-1-deficient mice display a severe defect in the base excision repair pathway leading to radiosensitivity and genomic instability. They are protected against necrosis induced by massive oxidative stress in various inflammatory processes. Mice lacking p53 are highly predisposed to malignancy resulting from defective cell cycle checkpoints, resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis as well as from upregulation of the iNOS gene resulting in chronic oxidative stress. Here, we report the generation of doubly null mutant mice. We found that tumour-free survival of parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice increased by 50% compared with that of parp- 1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. Tumour formation in nude mice injected with oncogenic parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) fibroblasts was significantly delayed compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. Upon gamma-irradiation, a partial restoration of S-phase radiosensitivity was found in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) primary fibroblasts compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) cells. In addition, iNOS expression and nitrite release were dramatically reduced in the parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice compared with parp-1(+/+)p53(-/-) mice. The abrogation of the oxydated status of p53(-/-) cells, due to the absence of parp-1, may be the cause of the delay in the onset of tumorigenesis in parp-1(-/-)p53(-/-) mice.",Excluded
3124,"Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for patients with unresectable or medically inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. Purpose: The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) in patients with unresectable or medically inoperable cholangiocarcinoma remains unclear. We examined the efficacy and safety of SABR in this group of patients. Method(s): From January 2008 to December 2014, 15 patients with 17 lesions were included in this study. The lesions included 14 intrahepatic, 1 hilar, and 2 distal bile duct tumors. Three patients were classified as medically inoperable because of old age or multiple comorbidities. Tumors measured 0.8-13 cm (median, 3.6 cm). The median prescribed dose was 45 Gy delivered in 5 fractions over 5 consecutive days. Result(s): The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 29.9 months. Objective responses were observed for 10 of 17 tumors (58.8%), including 3 complete responses (17.6%). The median survival duration was 12.6 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 50.3% and 14.4%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year in-field failure-free rates were 61.5% and 30.8%, respectively. For patients with biologically effective doses (BEDs) exceeding 75 Gy10, the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 58.3% and 33.3%, respectively, compared to 20.0% and 0%, respectively for those with BEDs lower than 75 Gy10. Radiation-induced liver disease did not develop in any patient. Acute toxicities were generally mild and tolerable. Conclusion(s): Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy could be an alternative treatment for unresectable or medically inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. Further dose escalation may be considered to optimize local control.Copyright © 2017 Wichtig Publishing.",Excluded
3155,"The Free-Hand Technique for S2-Alar-Iliac Screw Placement: A Safe and Effective Method for Sacropelvic Fixation in Adult Spinal Deformity. BACKGROUND: Spinopelvic fixation is an integral part of achieving solid fusion across the lumbosacral junction, especially in deformity procedures requiring substantial correction or long-segment constructs. Traditional S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screw-placement techniques utilize fluoroscopy, increasing operative time and radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon. We describe a novel free-hand technique for S2AI screw placement in patients with adult spinal deformity., METHODS: We reviewed the records of 45 consecutive patients who underwent spinopelvic fixation performed with use of S2AI screws by the senior surgeon and various fellows or residents over a 12-month period (2015 to 2016). In each case, the S2AI screws were placed utilizing a free-hand technique without fluoroscopic or image guidance. Screw position and accuracy were assessed by intraoperative O-arm imaging and analyzed using 3-dimensional interactive manipulation of computed tomography images., RESULTS: A total of 100 screws were placed, 51 by the senior surgeon and 49 by trainees. The mean patient age was 57.4 +/- 12.7 years at the time of surgery; 37 (82.2%) of the patients were female. Preoperative diagnoses included adult idiopathic scoliosis (n = 19), adult degenerative scoliosis (n = 15), flatback syndrome (n = 2), fixed sagittal imbalance (n = 6), and distal junctional kyphosis (n = 3). Five (5%) of the screws were placed with moderate to severe cortical breaches, all of which perforated the pelvis posteriorly, with no clinically notable neurovascular or visceral complications. The breach rate did not differ significantly between the senior surgeon and trainees., CONCLUSIONS: The free-hand technique for S2AI screw placement, when performed in a standardized manner, was demonstrated to be safe and reliable in constructs requiring spinopelvic fixation. The accuracy of screw placement relies on visible and palpable anatomic landmarks that obviate the need for intraoperative fluoroscopy or image guidance, potentially reducing operative time and radiation exposure., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

877,"Sunscreen protection against cis-urocanic acid production in human skin. Commercial sunscreens may offer some protection from immunosuppression induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but agreement concerning the degree of protection is lacking. Cis-urocanic acid, formed by the photoisomerization of transurocanic acid is considered an important mediator of the cutaneous immunomodulation resulting from exposure to UV radiation. We investigated the effect of sunscreens on the isomerization of urocanic acid in 17 human subjects. Two sunscreens containing chemical filters, sun protection factor (SPF) 4 and SPF 10, and a SPF 10 sunscreen with a physical filter were applied at a thickness of 2 mg/cm2. The effect of a thin layer (0.5 mg/cm2) of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was also evaluated, as the amount of sunscreen applied in practice may be considerably less than recommended. All areas were irradiated with a single UV dose of 3.6 SED (standard erythema doses). In irradiated unprotected skin the median net production of cis-urocanic acid was 52% (relative amount). In the sites treated with the chemical sunscreens, the production of cis-urocanic acid was 7.4% (SPF 4) and 3.5% (SPF 10), and isomerization was thus reduced more efficiently at a higher SPF (p<0.01). The physical sunscreen reduced the formation of cis-UCA to 15%, and was significantly less effective than both the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen (p<0.01) and the SPF 4 sunscreen (p<0.01). The production of cis-urocanic acid in the area treated with the thin layer of the chemical SPF 10 sunscreen was 22%. The protection against the production of cis-urocanic acid was therefore reduced significantly (p<0.01) when the sunscreen was applied in an amount lower than recommended.",Excluded

Purpose: To estimate the dose response relationship for submandibular gland (SMG) recovery using salivary scintigraphy in patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer treated with curative image guided chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Ninety newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients (T1-3, N0-2c, M0) treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy on a prospective clinical trial were assessed for salivary toxicity at predefined intervals using dynamic salivary scintigraphy. The SMG function was measured using salivary excretion fraction (SEF) ratios at baseline and 6 monthly. Tolerance dose (TD) 50 for submandibular gland was estimated from dose response curves. Result(s): The mean SEF ratio of 180 SMGs decreased at 6 months with a nadir at 12 months after treatment (SEF ratio 15%) and progressively recovered over time reaching 38% over 24 months. There was significant inverse correlation between SEF ratio and mean SMG dose at 6 months (r = -0.18, p = 0.04); 12-months (r = -0.36, p < 0.001); 18-months (r = -0.48, p < 0.001); 24-months (r = -0.42, p < 0.001); and more than 24-months (r = -0.56, p < 0.001). The estimated TD 50 values at 1 year and 2 year post treatment were 36 Gy and 44 Gy respectively with SEF ratio of <=45% used to define severe xerostomia. For every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose below 54 Gy, there is 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia. Conclusion(s): The submandibular gland function declines after radiotherapy with a nadir at 12 months and there is incomplete recovery over time with continued improvement over 24 months. The TD 50 at 1 year and 2 year was 36 Gy and 44 Gy with a 2-2.5% reduction in the probability of severe xerostomia for every 1 Gy reduction in mean dose.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
589,"Outcomes of rectal cancer with liver oligometastases. Purpose: In patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer to the liver, long term survival is possible and a multi-modality treatment approach may be considered. This is a report of a single institution experience of oligometastatic rectal cancer patients after treatment of the primary tumor and pelvic lymph nodes with extended course chemoradiation therapy. Method(s): Between 2004 and 2013, 26 oligometastatic rectal cancer patients with liver metastases were treated with extended course chemoradiation at our institution followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Amongst these there were 17 men and 9 women. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 59.8 years, with a range from 36 to 87 years of age. Eleven patients had metastases in other sites in addition to liver, and one patient in our cohort had lung metastasis with no liver metastasis. Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), distant metastases (DM) and local control (LC). Result(s): OS rates were 95%, and 70% at 12 and 24 months respectively, with a mean survival time of 40.5 months. PFS rates were 91% and 36% at 12 and 24 months respectively, with a mean PFS time of 23.1 months. LC rates were 91% and 66% at 12 and 24 months respectively. DM rates were 0% and 61% at 12 and 24 months respectively. Finally, when censoring deaths, progression of liver metastases and distant progression, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated five events of local failure. Conclusion(s): This series demonstrated an OS of 70% at 24 months, with a mean survival of 40.5 months. Significantly, LC was only 66% despite the use of extended course chemoradiation and TME. This data suggests that many patients with oligometastatic rectal cancer will survive past 2 years, and that a substantial number will fail locally as well as distantly. Therefore, a multimodality approach is reasonable. Recent data suggests that a hypofractionated radiation regiment of 25 Gy in 5 Gy fractions allows an equivalent LC compared to extended course chemoradiation with 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions. A short course of radiation may be more consistent with the goals of care of the oligometastatic rectal cancer patient who is at high risk of recurrence.Copyright © Pioneer Bioscience Publishing Company.",Excluded
2394,"Can low-dose unenhanced chest CT be used for follow-up of lung nodules?. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to establish the difference in lung nodule volume between standard-dose contrast-enhanced and low-dose unenhanced CT., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with known pulmonary metastases underwent three CT examinations on 1 day: two unenhanced low-dose (120 kVp and 30 mAs) and a standard-dose (120-140 kVp and 75-200 mAs) contrast-enhanced chest CT examinations. For nodules<1000 mm3, nodule volume was quantified using dedicated software from the CT manufacturer. Wilcoxon's signed rank tests were used for analysis of nodules<=200 mm3 and >200 mm3 (approximately diameter of 8 mm)., RESULTS: One hundred one nodules (n=69<=200 mm3) were analyzed in 15 of these subjects. Measured volume of nodules<=200 mm3 was systematically lower on both low-dose unenhanced CT examinations when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT (differences, 13.7% and 15.5%, respectively; p<0.0001), but nodule volume was not different between low-dose CT (median difference, 1.0%; p=0.10). Nodule volume was not systematically different between the protocols for nodules>200 mm3 (p>0.30)., CONCLUSION: For lung nodules<=200 mm3 (approximately 8 mm) the measured volume on low-dose unenhanced CT is significantly lower when compared with standard-dose contrast-enhanced CT. This effect is likely due to contrast administration rather than other imaging parameters, which should be taken into account in the follow-up of lung nodules because growth can remain undetected or doubling time underestimated.",Excluded

1892,"An alternative approach to account for patient organ doses from imaging guidance procedures. PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility of an alternative method of accounting for additional organ doses resulting from image guidance procedures during patient treatment planning through tabulated values based on scan protocol and scan site., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient-specific imaging dose to 30 patients resulting from Varian OBI kV-CBCT scans using the Standard Head (17 patients), Low-dose Thorax (8 patients), and Pelvic (5 patients) scan protocols were retrospectively calculated using Monte Carlo methods. Dose dependence on scan location and patient geometry was explored. Patient organ doses were analyzed by using dose-volume histograms and expressed by the mean, minimum dose delivered to 50% of the organ volume, D50. The reported doses are dose-to-medium instead of dose-to-water., RESULTS: The organ doses from all patient-specific calculations show predictable and limited ranges across patients. For brain isocenters using Standard Head Scans: Bone: 0.7-1.1 cGy, Brain: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Brainstem: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Skin: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Eye: 0.03-0.3 cGy. For head and neck patients using the Standard Head Scan: Bone: 0.3-0.6 cGy, Parotids: 0.3-0.4 cGy, Spinal Cord: 0.15-0.25 cGy, Thyroid: 0.1-0.25 cGy, Skin: 0.2-0.3 cGy, Trachea-Esophagus: 0.1-0.2 cGy. For chest using Thorax Scans: Bone: 1.1-1.8 cGy, Soft tissue organs (Bowel, Lung, Heart, Kidney, Esophagus, and Spinal Cord): 0.3-0.6 cGy. For abdominal site using Pelvic Scans: Bone: 3.2-4.2 cGy. Soft tissue organs (Bladder, Bowel, Rectum, Prostate, and Skin) D50s fell between 1.2 and 2.2 cGy. Femoral Heads: 2.5-3.4 cGy., CONCLUSIONS: It is adequate to estimate and account for organ dose by using tabulated values based on scan procedure and site because organ doses from imaging procedures are only modestly dependent upon scan location and body size. Considering the dose variation and magnitude of dose from each scan protocol in comparison to therapeutic doses, this approach provides a simple alternative to account for additional imaging guidance doses during patient treatment planning. Clinicians can use these tabulated values to make informed decisions in selecting the appropriate imaging procedures and imaging frequency during radiotherapy treatment.

2901,"Comparison of muscle area and strength between OA knees with and without structural progression - Data from the OA initiative. Purpose: Quadriceps strength was observed to protect against the onset of symptomatic knee OA, but whether it protects against structural progression of knee OA once it is established radiographically, is currently unclear. The objectives of this study were to determine whether baseline or two-year changes in anatomical muscle cross sectional areas (ACSAs) of the quadriceps (heads), hamstrings, and adductors, and/or muscle strength of the extensor and flexors differ between OA knees with structural progression (cartilage loss in MRI and joint space width loss in X-rays) compared with OA knees without structural progression. Method(s): A subcohort of the OA Initiative was used, for which baseline and one-year follow up (FU) quantitative MRI analysis on cartilage thickness was available in one knee (n=719). Of these, n=561 also had quantitative measurement of radiographic joint space width (JSW) at baseline and at one year follow-up, and central X-ray readings from fixed flexion radiographs (public-use data sets 0.E.1/3.E.1). From these, we identified those with structural progression in the medial femorotibial compartment according to both MRI and radiographic JSW, using the smallest detectable change method (n=46). Of those, we included 41 with KLG2 or 3, of which n=23 had axial T1-weighted SE images of the thigh at baseline and 2 year follow-up as well as muscle strength measurement (Isometric chair, Metitur Oy, Jyvaskyla, Finland). For 20 of these we were able to match controls with no progression in either MRI or JSW, with the same sex and KLG, with a body height within 3cm and a BMI within 5kg/m2, and with a WOMAC pain score within 5 (of 20) units. Public use MRI data (T1-weighted spin echo sequence/0.E.1/3.E.1) and custom software were used to determine the ACSAs and signal intensities of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and adductors in an axial image located at 33% of the femoral length (distal to proximal; location estimated based on body height). The four quadriceps heads were analyzed in an axial image slice located at 30% femoral length. Baseline and follow-up data were analyzed independently. A paired t-test was used to compare measurements in progressors vs. nonprogressors. Result(s): Cases with MRI and X-ray progression (age 63.1+/-7.8 y) and controls without progression (age 65.8+/-10.0 y) consisted of 12 women and 8 men, respectively. Progressors did not show significantly smaller baseline total quadriceps, specific quadriceps heads, flexor, or adductor ACSAs, or significantly smaller extensor and flexor strength than matched controls (Table 1). (Table presented) Further, no differences in the mean or SD signal intensity in any of the muscle regions were noted at baseline (data not shown). Changes in ACSAs over 2 years also did not significantly differ between progressor and non-progressor knees (Table 1). When stratifying comparisons for cases with little baseline pain (WOMAC score of 0-1; n=7) vs. those with a score of 5-8 (n=8), the findings were similar (data not shown). Conclusion(s): Progressor (case) and non-progressor (control) knees in this study were carefully selected from a large subsample, based on two independent measures of structural OA progression (MRI cartilage loss and JSW reduction in X-rays). Further, cases and controls were carefully matched for measures known to be associated with progression or with muscle area. The results of this exploratory study do not provide support that, once radiographic knee OA is established, baseline or longitudinal changes in thigh muscle ACSAs or strength predict (or are associated) with structural progression.",Excluded
1190,"Measuring Corneal Haze by Using Scheimpflug Photography and Confocal Microscopy. PURPOSE: We compared corneal backscatter estimated from a Scheimpflug camera with backscatter estimated from a clinical confocal microscope across a wide range of corneal haze., METHODS: A total of 59 corneas from 35 patients with a range of severity of Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy and 15 corneas from 9 normal participants were examined using a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) and a confocal microscope (ConfoScan 4). The mean image brightness from the anterior 120 mum, midcornea, and posterior 60 mum of the cornea across the central 2 mm recorded by the Scheimpflug camera and analogous regions from the confocal microscope were measured and standardized. Differences between instruments and correlations between backscatter and disease severity were determined by using generalized estimating equation models., RESULTS: Backscatter measured by the two instruments in the anterior and midcornea were correlated (r = 0.67 and 0.43, respectively, P < 0.001), although in the posterior cornea they were not correlated (r = 0.13, P = 0.66). Measured with the Scheimpflug camera, mean backscatter from the anterior and midcornea were greater, whereas backscatter from the posterior cornea was lower (P < 0.001) than that measured by the confocal microscope. Backscatter from the anterior cornea was correlated with disease severity for both instruments (Scheimpflug, r = 0.55, P < 0.001; confocal, r = 0.49, P = 0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: The Scheimpflug camera and confocal microscope should not be used interchangeably to measure corneal haze. The ability to detect changes in backscatter with disease severity is superior with the Scheimpflug camera. However, the confocal microscope provides higher resolution of corneal structure.",Excluded
3602,"A phase I/II trial of intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) dose escalation with concurrent fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (FDR-G) in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Purpose: Local failure in unresectable pancreatic cancer may contribute to death. We hypothesized that intensification of local therapy would improve local control and survival. The objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated radiation dose delivered by intensity modulated radiation with fixed-dose rate gemcitabine (FDR-G), freedom from local progression (FFLP), and overall survival (OS). Methods and Materials: Eligibility included pathologic confirmation of adenocarcinoma, radiographically unresectable, performance status of 0-2, absolute neutrophil count of >=1500/mm3, platelets >=100,000/mm3, creatinine <2 mg/dL, bilirubin <3 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase <=2.5 x upper limit of normal. FDR-G (1000 mg/m2/100 min intravenously) was given on days -22 and -15, 1, 8, 22, and 29. Intensity modulated radiation started on day 1. Dose levels were escalated from 50-60 Gy in 25 fractions. Dose-limiting toxicity was defined as gastrointestinal toxicity grade (G) >=3, neutropenic fever, or deterioration in performance status to >=3 between day 1 and 126. Dose level was assigned using TITE-CRM (Time-to-Event Continual Reassessment Method) with the target dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rate set to 0.25. Result(s): Fifty patients were accrued. DLTs were observed in 11 patients: G3/4 anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and/or dehydration (7); duodenal bleed (3); duodenal perforation (1). The recommended dose is 55 Gy, producing a probability of DLT of 0.24. The 2-year FFLP is 59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32-79). Median and 2-year overall survival are 14.8 months (95% CI: 12.6-22.2) and 30% (95% CI 17-45). Twelve patients underwent resection (10 R0, 2 R1) and survived a median of 32 months. Conclusion(s): High-dose radiation therapy with concurrent FDR-G can be delivered safely. The encouraging efficacy data suggest that outcome may be improved in unresectable patients through intensification of local therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1336,"[The aqueous humour antioxidative capacity in different types and color of the age-related cataract]. BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress results from increased oxidative processes, decreased antioxidative protection, or both processes simultaneously. Photooxidative stress, as a form of oxidative stress, induced by the energy of solar radiation, today is considered as crucial in the age-related cataractogenesis. Other known and unknown, endogenous and egsogenous factors that contribute to the oxidative stress intensity, can influnce the cataract type and brunescence. Thus the oxidative stress intensity and its form might determine the cataract type and brunescence, and also make the efforts in cataract prevention more complex. Hence, the objective of the present paper was to investigate the current amount of antioxidative capacity in aqueous humour during the cataract genesis of different types and pigmentation of cataract., METHODS: Transversal review of 80 samples of humour aqueous obtained during extracapsular cataract extraction. Aqueouses were analyzed by tiobarbituric acid (TBA) method for the total antioxidant activity estimation, expressed as %iMDA, and by using 0.1 ml of aqueous., RESULTS: The mixed type of cataract showed the statistically significantly lower values of the intensities of antioxidative protection in aqueous humour compared to cortical and nuclear cataracts (p < 0.001, respectively). Between pure nuclear and cortical cataracts we found the small differences of the investigated parameter, but they pointed to the decreased level of antioxidative protection, i.e. the increased intensity of the aqueous humour oxidative stress in the cortical cataract type. A significant correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturation and the %iMDA (p < 0.05) was found., CONCLUSIONS: The role of the oxidative stress, here expressed as the antioxidative capacity of aqueous humour, could not be the same for all the cataract types. The lower level of antioxidative protection of aqueous in brunescent and mixed cataracts may point to the higher intensity of oxidative stress in those cataract types. The correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturity and %iMDA points to the significant decrease of the aqueous antioxidative protection in the cataract progression.",Excluded
28,"Extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria: a case series. OBJECT When intracranial tumors invade the overlying skull, gross resection typically includes removal of the involved bone. Methods used to repair the resulting structural defect in the cranium include artificial prostheses, allogeneic bone grafts, and autoclaving the autologous graft. The authors have previously reported a case involving high-dose extracorporeal ionizing radiation to treat the tumorous calvaria intraoperatively, followed by reimplantation of the treated bone flap. In this paper the authors report the long-term follow-up of that case, as well as results of using extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria (EITC) for an additional 20 patients treated similarly. METHODS The decision to undergo EITC was typically anticipated preoperatively, but determined intraoperatively, if upon inspection the bone flap was invaded by tumor. The bone flap was then delivered to the radiation oncology department, where a total dose of 120 Gy was delivered, using a clinical linear accelerator, over a period of approximately 15 minutes. After the intracranial tumor resection was completed, the irradiated craniotomy bone flap was reimplanted and the wound was closed in a standard fashion. A retrospective review of patients who had undergone EITC was performed for evidence of calvarial tumor recurrence or other complications. RESULTS Since the originally reported case, 20 additional patients have received EITC during craniotomy for invasive tumors. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients were diagnosed with meningioma: 12 (67%) with WHO Grade I, 5 (28%) with WHO Grade II, and 1 with WHO Grade III (6%). The remaining 3 patients presented with dural-based B-cell lymphoma with extensive adjacent bone invasion (n = 2) and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung (n = 1). Follow-up of the 21 patients ranged from 1 to 132 months, with a mean of 41 months and a median of 23 months. No patients have experienced tumor recurrence, infection associated with the treated calvaria, or evidence of bone flap resorption. CONCLUSIONS Calvaria reconstructions represent an important component in structural and cosmetic outcome following craniectomy for tumorous bone. The authors' long-term experience with EITC has been excellent with no local tumor recurrence or complications. Therefore, EITC represents an excellent and efficient option for cranial reconstruction in such patients.",Excluded

Penoscrotal extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare intraepithelial adenocarcinoma in older male patients, and no effective nonsurgical treatment strategies are currently available. The aim of this study was to report the usefulness of external radiotherapy (RT) for penoscrotal EMPD in an inoperable elderly patient. This report presents the treatment of an 89-year-old man with widespread penoscrotal EMPD. A multidisciplinary treatment team decided on radical RT. The patient received a radiation dose of 61.8 Gy in 30 fractions through electron and photon beams. His treatment tolerance was good, and no severe toxicity had been observed up the last follow-up. At 6.5 years after the RT, the patient showed no evidence of recurrence. Definitive RT resulted in excellent disease control and minimal toxicity; thus, it could be a promising nonsurgical therapeutic option for penoscrotal EMPD, even in extremely elderly individuals.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded
2549,"Pre-operative Simulation of the Appropriate C-arm Position Using Computed Tomography Post-processing Software Reduces Radiation and Contrast Medium Exposure During EVAR Procedures. Objective/Background The aim was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a new method for pre-operative calculation of an appropriate C-arm position for iliac bifurcation visualisation during endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) procedures by using three dimensional computed tomography angiography (CTA) post-processing software. Methods Post-processing software was used to simulate C-arm angulations in two dimensions (oblique, cranial/caudal) for appropriate visualisation of distal landing zones at the iliac bifurcation during EVAR. Retrospectively, 27 consecutive EVAR patients (25 men, mean +/- SD age 73 +/- 7 years) were identified; one group of patients (NEW; n = 12 [23 iliac bifurcations]) was compared after implementation of the new method with a group of patients who received a historic method (OLD; n = 15 [23 iliac bifurcations]), treated with EVAR before the method was applied. Results In the OLD group, a median of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-3) digital subtraction angiography runs were needed per iliac bifurcation versus 1.0 (IQR 1-1) runs in the NEW group (p = .007). The median dose area products per iliac bifurcation were 11951 mGy*cm2 (IQR 7308-16663 mGy*cm2) for the NEW, and 39394 mGy*cm2 (IQR 19066-53702 mGy*cm2) for the OLD group, respectively (p = .001). The median volume of contrast per iliac bifurcation was 13.0 mL (IQR: 13-13 mL) in the NEW and 26 mL (IQR 13-39 mL) in the OLD group (p = .007). Conclusion Pre-operative simulation of the appropriate C-arm angulation in two dimensions using dedicated computed tomography angiography post-processing software is feasible and significantly reduces radiation and contrast medium exposure.Copyright © 2016 European Society for Vascular Surgery",Excluded

1713,"Investigation of dosimetric variations of liver radiotherapy using deformable registration of planning CT and cone-beam CT. Many patients with technically unresectable or medically inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) had hepatic anatomy variations as a result of interfraction deformation during fractionated radiotherapy. We conducted this retrospective study to investigate interfractional normal liver dosimetric consequences via reconstructing weekly dose in HCC patients. Twenty-three patients with HCC received conventional fractionated three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) were enrolled in this retrospective investigation. Among them, seven patients had been diagnosed of radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) and the other 16 patients had good prognosis after treatment course. The cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans were acquired once weekly for each patient throughout the treatment, deformable image registration (DIR) of planning CT (pCT) and CBCT was performed to acquire modified CBCT (mCBCT), and the structural contours were propagated by the DIR. The same plan was applied to mCBCT to perform dose calculation. Weekly dose distribution was displayed on the pCT dose space and compared using dose difference, target coverage, and dose volume histograms. Statistical analysis was performed to identify the significant dosimetric variations. Among the 23 patients, the three weekly normal liver D50 increased by 0.2 Gy, 4.2 Gy, and 4.7 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 1.0 Gy, 2.7 Gy, and 3.1 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Mean dose to the normal liver (Dmean) increased by 0.5 Gy, 2.6 Gy, and 4.0 Gy, respectively, for patients with RILD, and 0.4 Gy, 3.1 Gy, and 3.4 Gy, respectively, for patients without RILD. Regarding patients with RILD, the average values of the third weekly D50 and Dmean were both over hepatic radiation tolerance, while the values of patients without RILD were below. The dosimetric consequence showed that the liver dose between patients with and without RILD were different relative to the planned dose, and the RILD patients suffered from liver dose over hepatic radiation tolerance. Evaluation of routinely acquired CBCT images during radiation therapy provides biological information on the organs at risk, and dose estimation based on mCBCT could potentially form the basis for personalized response adaptive therapy.

3121,"Radiation Exposure Optimisation During AF Ablations Utilising the Cryoballoon Ablation System. BACKGROUND: Radiation risk minimisation during cardiac catheterisation, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation procedures, requires a multifaceted approach involving both technique and technology., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate radiation dose associated with cryoballoon compared to conventional radiofrequency (RF) AF ablation procedures., METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation were collected in a single-centre registry. Radiation and procedural data for index AF ablation procedures using four ablation techniques were compared: RF ablation with and without the anti-scatter grid (RF Grid and RF Gridless), and cryoballoon ablation utilising first and second-generation Medtronic Arctic Front Cryoballoons (Cryo; Arctic Front, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), with and without 3D imaging during fluoroscopy (Cryo 3D and Cryo)., RESULTS: We studied 418 patients; 30 RF Grid, 68 RF No Grid, 12 Cryo 3D and 308 Cryo. The dose area product (DAP; Gycm2), adjusted for patient standardised weight of 80kg, was significantly higher for the Cryo 3D (21.91) and RF Grid (7.31) than the Cryo (2.13) and RF Gridless (3.31) groups; as a result, Cryo 3D was discontinued and RF Grid was only used when clinically required. Comparing the remaining groups, DAP for Cryo was significantly lower than RF Gridless (p<0.001) mainly attributable to a difference in fluoroscopy use (13.2 vs. 17.3 mins; p<0.001). Cryo procedure time was also significantly shorter (80 mins vs. 133 mins; p<0.01)., CONCLUSION: Cryoballoon AF ablations can be performed efficiently using Gridless fluoroscopy techniques achieving significant reduction in radiation exposure and procedure time while maintaining safety and efficacy. In this observational study, cryoballoon AF ablations compare favourably to conventional RF ablations in terms of these parameters.

61,"Cyberknife radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a well-established treatment modality for vestibular schwannoma. Initial reports using single-stage radiosurgery have demonstrated excellent tumor control rates. Many patients now elect to undergo radiosurgery given the potential for tumor control while avoiding the morbidity associated with microsurgical resection. In attempt to improve hearing preservation rates of single-state radiosurgery, staged frame-based radiotherapy using a 12-hour interfraction interval was used at the authors' institution and has shown a hearing preservation rate of 77% at 2 years of follow-up. With the arrival of the Cyberknife, a frameless, image-guided radiotherapy system, staged stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma became more practical. This article outlines the rationale and treatment protocols developed at Stanford University (California) and reports the authors' initial experience using the Cyberknife to treat vestibular schwannoma.",Excluded
1936,"Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema and suppression of contact hypersensitivity responses in patients with polymorphic light eruption. Ultraviolet-radiation suppresses cell-mediated immunity in healthy humans. It has been postulated that, in the short term, this immunosuppression prevents autoimmune responses to ultraviolet-radiation damaged skin. Patients with polymorphic light eruption (PLE) demonstrate abnormal responses to ultraviolet-radiation suggestive of an immune response to an ultraviolet-radiation-induced antigen. We investigated whether PLE patients (n=22) were resistant to ultraviolet-radiation-induced immunosuppression compared to skin-type, aged-matched controls (n=23). Groups of patients and controls (six subjects per group) received a single dose of solar-simulated ultraviolet-radiation of either 0, 0.6, 1 or 2 minimal erythema doses (MED). Erythema was quantified using a reflectance meter and all volunteers were sensitised on the irradiated site with dinitrochlorobenzene. Contact hypersensitivity responses (CHS) to dinitrochlorobenzene were quantified after challenge using ultrasound. Ultraviolet-radiation-induced erythema was comparable in patients and controls. CHS was comparable in unirradiated patients and controls. UVR-induced a dose-dependent suppression of CHS in all volunteers but patients were more resistant to immunosuppression after 1MED. Exposure to 1MED suppressed CHS by 78% in controls but induced less suppression in patients (44%, p < 0.01).

2933,"Precise determination of the erythema response of human skin to ultraviolet radiation and quantification of effects of protectors. BACKGROUND: We describe highly reproducible methods for quantifying the erythema response of precisely selected areas (spots) of human skin to graded doses of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). These methods have permitted evaluation of the efficacy of protectors, such as sulforaphane from crucifers, that defend cells through induction of cytoprotective (phase 2) genes., METHODS: Spots on the back were precisely located by opaque, adhesive, vinyl templates provided with 16 circular, 2.0 cm diameter occludable windows. Doses (100-800 mJ/cm(2)) of narrow-band (311 nm) UVR were administered, and the erythema index (a(*)) was measured with a chromometer on treated and control areas, before and after radiation., RESULTS: Daily variations in basal a(*) values of each spot were much smaller than the differences of a(*) values among spots of one individual, or those of corresponding spots among different individuals. The increments in erythema responses to UVR (Delta a(*)) were similar despite large variations of basal a(*) of spots. The most appropriate measure of UVR-evoked erythema is therefore the Delta a(*) value for each spot, which is an independent observational entity. Delta a(*) was proportional to UVR dose, and independent of spot location. To evaluate effectiveness of protectors against UVR damage we paired horizontally adjacent spots for treatment and controls. Vertical or random spot pairing did not provide significantly higher consistency. Protective efficacy against UVR erythema is appropriately expressed as percent reduction in Delta a(*) values upon treatment with inducers., CONCLUSIONS: The protection of skin against UVR damage can be quantified precisely from changes in erythema index (Delta a(*)) obtained with a chromometer.",Excluded

Purpose: To investigate the incidence and prognosis of severe radiation-induced lymphopenia (sRIL) after postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) for resected NSCLC. Patients and Methods: Between 1998 and 2017, 170 patients treated with PORT for NSCLC were retrospectively reviewed. Lymphopenia was divided into tertiles with severe lymphopenia defined as absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) < 0.37 x 103/ul. Result(s): sRIL was observed in 32.3% of patients. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated sRIL was associated with planning target volume radiation fraction numbers (OR 1.09, p = 0.005) and total lung mean dose (OR 1.12, p = 0.006). With a median follow-up time of 12.2 years, the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 14.8 months and 28.4 months respectively in patients with sRIL, vs. 21.7 months (p = 0.008) and 48.3 months (p = 0.01) respectively in patients without sRIL. Multivariable analyses indicated sRIL significantly decreased OS (HR 1.95, p < 0.01). Since PORT for stage I-II NSCLC was done largely for positive margins, which may confound the contribution of severe RIL, we analyzed stage III separately and found that sRIL also significantly decreased OS (HR 1.88, p = 0.004) in multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): For this long-term outcome study, severe RIL correlated with total lung mean dose and radiation fractionation numbers, and was a strong prognostic factor for poor survival in PORT patients, particularly in patients with stage III NSCLC, highlighting the importance of an intact immune system for post-radiation immunologic disease surveillance.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
1582,"Human brain imaging and radiation dosimetry of 11C-N-desmethyl-loperamide, a PET radiotracer to measure the function of P-glycoprotein. UNLABELLED: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a membrane-bound efflux pump that limits the distribution of drugs to several organs of the body. At the blood-brain barrier, P-gp blocks the entry of both loperamide and its metabolite, N-desmethyl-loperamide (N-dLop), and thereby prevents central opiate effects. Animal studies have shown that (11)C-dLop, compared with (11)C-loperamide, is an especially promising radiotracer because it generates negligible radiometabolites that enter the brain. The purposes of this study were to determine whether (11)C-dLop is a substrate for P-gp at the blood-brain barrier in humans and to measure the distribution of radioactivity in the entire body to estimate radiation exposure., METHODS: Brain PET scans were acquired in 4 healthy subjects for 90 min and included concurrent measurements of the plasma concentration of unchanged radiotracer. Time-activity data from the whole brain were quantified using a 1-tissue-compartment model to estimate the rate of entry (K(1)) of radiotracer into the brain. Whole-body PET scans were acquired in 8 healthy subjects for 120 min., RESULTS: For brain imaging, after the injection of (11)C-dLop the concentration of radioactivity in the brain was low (standardized uptake value, approximately 15%) and stable after approximately 20 min. In contrast, uptake of radioactivity in the pituitary was about 50-fold higher than that in the brain. The plasma concentration of (11)C-dLop declined rapidly, but the percentage composition of plasma was unusually stable, with the parent radiotracer constituting 85% of total radioactivity after approximately 5 min. The rate of brain entry was low (K(1) = 0.009 +/- 0.002 mL.cm(-3). min(-1); n = 4). For whole-body imaging, as a measure of radiation exposure to the entire body the effective dose of (11)C-dLop was 7.8 +/- 0.6 muSv/MBq (n = 8)., CONCLUSION: The low brain uptake of radioactivity is consistent with (11)C-dLop being a substrate for P-gp in humans and confirms that this radiotracer generates negligible quantities of brain-penetrant radiometabolites. In addition, the low rate of K(1) is consistent with P-gp rapidly effluxing substrates while they transit through the lipid bilayer. The radiation exposure of (11)C-dLop is similar to that of many other (11)C-radiotracers. Thus, (11)C-dLop is a promising radiotracer to study the function of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier, at which impaired function would allow increased uptake into the brain.",Excluded
960,Cord blood transplantation using minimum conditioning regimens for patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by severe infections. Patients with severe infections are thought to be ineligible for cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBT) because the conventional 5-6 day-conditioning regimens potentially makes them susceptible to fatal infections by the time neutrophil engraftment occurs. Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m2 fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT. The AML patient received 40 mg/m2 of melphalan on day-2 to reduce the leukemia burden. Both patients achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 19 and day 20 after CBT without an apparent exacerbation of the infections and remained in remission at 23 and 18 months after the CBT. These findings suggest that the 1-2 day regimens excluding antihuman thymocyte globulin may be sufficiently potent to ensure engraftment of CB in immunocompromised patients and safely administered even when patients are complicated by active infections. © 2008 The Japanese Society of Hematology.,Excluded

UNLABELLED: It is unknown whether model of renarrowing after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis (ISR) is influenced by the type of geographic miss (GM)., METHODS: In 166 ISR treated with Galileo, serial quantitative coronary angiographic analysis was done. Minimal lumen diameters and lengths were measured for (1) stent, (2) peri-stent subsegments subjected to angioplasty with/without irradiation, and (3) irradiation margins. GM was defined as: (Type 1) edge injury within the 32P source dose fall-off: 2.0 mm inside and outside the source end marker or (Type 2) overt, nonirradiated injury: beyond the outer 2.0-mm long dose fall-off zone., RESULTS: Restenosis rate was 28.3% at 8.9+/-4.5 months with 60% located exclusively outside the stent. Type 1 GM was present in 24.7% of proximal edges, whereas Type 2 in 18.1%. Respective percentages for distal edges were 23.5% and 15.7%. Regardless of presence and type of GM, significant late lumen loss occurred only outside the stent. However, the biggest late lumen loss at the proximal edge was induced by the Type 1 GM (0.65+/-0.79, p<0.001), while proximal Type 2 GM was not associated with edge renarrowing (-0.04+/-0.48, p=NS). Both reference lumen diameter and proximal Type 1 GM influenced restenosis independently (OR 0.47; 95%CI 0.24-0.90; p=0.023 and OR 2.46; 95%CI 1.12-5.40; p=0.025)., CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of presence and type of geographic miss, late lumen loss after beta-radiation occurs only outside the stent. However, injury within the proximal 32P dose fall-off but not overt edge injury is associated with the biggest late lumen loss at the respective edge, triggering recurrent restenosis.",Excluded
858,"Plasma concentration of Donepezil did not accurately predict tissue concentration: A dynamic whole-body PET study in humans. Background: Donepezil hydrochloride (DNP) is acetylcholine esterase inhibitor most prescribed in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Time activity curve (TAC) in plasma obtained from arterialized venous blood was measured at 10 time points. Metabolite fraction was measured at 30 min by using HPLC. We assumed linear increase in metabolite fraction during scanning and obtained metabolite-corrected TAC (cTAC) of 11C-DNP. We examined the correlation between integrated TAC and tissue radioactivity of brain, pancreas, and myocardium. We also examined the correlation between plasma radioactivity at single time point and tissue radioactivity in these organs. Result(s): There was no significant correlation between integrated plasma radioactivity (0 to 30 min, 0 to 50 min) and tissue radioactivity at 30 min or 50 min in brain (p=0.066, p = 0.096), pancreas (p=0.156, p=0.162), and myocardium (p=0.308, p=0.481). Metabolite fraction of 11CDNP in plasma was 21.2 +/- 8.6% at 30 min. By using cTAC, we also found no significant correlation between plasma and tissue radioactivity. Conclusion(s): Although plasma concentration has been usually employed to predict tissue concentration of drugs, in case of DNP, plasma concentration did not accurately estimate tissue concentration. PET with positron emitting nuclide-labeled drug may provide more accurate and direct information on the tissue concentration of drugs.",Excluded
848,"[The value of split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan in CT urography]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the value of split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan in CT urography., METHODS: Eighty (80) patients with urinary obstruction were divided into two groups, group A was traditional CT urography scan, group B was split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan. The scan sequence of group A included conventional scan first, then enhanced scan in arterial phase, parenchyma phase and excretion delayed phase after the injection of 100 mL contrast agent. The scan sequence of group B included conventional scan and enhanced scan following two bolus injection of contrast; the first injection of contrast was 40 mL, the second injection was 60 mL with 15-30 minutes delay, then enhanced scan was conducted in arterial and parenchymal phase, the parenchymal phase scan was performed with dual energy scanning sequence. The image quality of urinary collecting system, the detection of urinary obstructive lesion, and radiation dose were compared between the two groups., RESULTS: Between the two imaging methods, the imaging quality of urinary system did not show significant difference, but radiation dose was statistically significant difference. The radiation dose of split-bolus 2-phase with virtual non-enhanced scan was only 55% of traditional CTU scan., CONCLUSION: Split-bolus2 phase with virtual non-enhanced scan could obtain the same image quality as tranditional CTU, while reducing the approximately half the radiation dose.",Excluded

Some gastrointestinal symptoms were worse in patients treated with octreotide. Octreotide is not indicated for prevention of diarrhea during pelvic radiation therapy.",Excluded
455,"Work history and radioprotection practices in relation to cancer incidence and mortality in US radiologic technologists performing nuclear medicine procedures. Introduction Technologists working in nuclear medicine (NM) are exposed to higher radiation doses than most other occupationally exposed populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of cancer in NM technologists in relation to work history, procedures performed and radioprotection practices. Methods From the US Radiologic Technologists cohort study, 72 755 radiologic technologists who completed a 2003-2005 questionnaire were followed for cancer mortality through 31 December 2012 and for cancer incidence through completion of a questionnaire in 2012-2013. Multivariable-adjusted models were used to estimate HRs for total cancer incidence and mortality by history of ever performing NM procedures and frequency of performing specific diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and associated radiation protection measures by decade. Results During follow-up (mean=7.5 years), 960 incident cancers and 425 cancer deaths were reported among the 22 360 technologists who worked with NM procedures. We observed no increased risk of cancer incidence (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.04) or death (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.19) among workers who ever performed NM procedures. HRs for cancer incidence but not mortality were higher for technologists who began performing therapeutic procedures in 1960 and later compared with the 1950s. Frequency of performing diagnostic or therapeutic NM procedures and use of radioprotection measures were not consistently associated with cancer risk. No clear associations were observed for specific cancers, but results were based on small numbers. Conclusion Cancer incidence and mortality were not associated with NM work history practices, including greater frequency of procedures performed.Copyright © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

We report the use of CBCT angiography using CBCT in 10 patients with 8 liver malignancies and 2 hypersplenisms during abdominal interventional procedures. CBCT was very useful for interventional radiologists to confirm a perfusion area of the artery catheter wedged on CT by injection of contrast media through the catheter tip, although the image quality was slightly degraded, scoring as 2.60 on average by streak artifacts. CBCT is space-saving because it does not require a CT system with a gantry, and it is also time-saving because it does not require the transfer of patients.",Excluded
1925,"Surgery rates in Danish incident cases of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the era of biological treatment a seven-year cohort study follow up. Background: Resent studies indicate that biological treatment (anti TNF alpha treatment) reduces surgery rates. We aim in this seven-year follow-up study of unselected, incident patients diagnosed with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis to assess surgery rates in the era of biological treatment. Method(s): From Jan. 1st 2003 to Dec. 31st 2004 all incident cases of patients diagnosed with CD (n = 208), UC (n = 328) or indeterminate colitis (IC, n = 27) were registered in a well defined Copenhagen area. All medical journals applicable for follow-up were reviewed and data on disease localization and behaviour according to the Montreal classifications, medications, endoscopies, X-ray-/CT-/MR-procedures, admissions, surgical events, cancers and deaths were registered. Result(s): The present follow-up study cohort consists of 186 CD and 265 UC. Of the 563 patients originally included in the study, 42 patients were excluded at follow-up. Twenty-eight patients did not have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 14 were not incident and 5 had IC. Eighteen (10 UC, 8 CD) were lost to follow-up and 47 (28 UC, 19 CD) deceased and were also excluded. The mean age in the present study was 38.7 years (median 35.0 range 1-93) and included 265 females and 251 males. All patients were followed for 7 years from diagnosis. For UC, 32 patients (12.1%) had a colectomy during the 7 years follow-up. Incidence of colectomy at 5 years was 9.8% (26 patients) and 8.7% (23) at 2 years. Fifty-two CD patients (28%) had their first intestinal resection (excluding fistula- and/or abscess's surgery) within 7 years follow-up. Forty-five (24.2%) had a resection within 5 years and 35 (18.8%) within 2 years follow-up. At 7 years follow-up 28 (8.0%) UC patients and 49 (26.6%) CD patients had at some point had biological treatment. Conclusion(s): Twenty-eight percent CD patients and 12.1% UC patients had their first surgery within 7 years follow-up. The surgical rates for CD in the present study in ""the biological era"" are lower than a previous Danish inception cohort from 1962-87 with surgical rates of 63% during ten years. However, it seems comparable to the surgery rates referred by the IBSEN study group, who reported 5 year surgical rates of CD and UC to 28.0% and 7.5% respectively in the mid-nineties.

Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longterm treatment outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with primary ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma treated with involved-field radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as Stage IE/IIE ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and underwent radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Since 2006, 55 patients received radiation therapy and were followed up for more than 6 months at our institution. At initial presentation, 53 patients had Stage IE disease and two had Stage IIE disease. There were 28 men and 27 women. The median age was 66 years (range, 39-90 years). Local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 47 months (range, 6-90 months). The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 30-30.6 Gy in 15- 17 fractions). All patients were treated by radiation alone, but oral steroid was used for four patients who had double vision at the beginning of treatment. Thirty-four patients were treated with 6 MV photon beams with a wedged pair of fields. Nineteen patients with a lesion confined to the conjunctive or eyelid were treated with 9 MeV electron beams with a single anterior field. In the remaining two patients, combination of the two beams was used. A lead lens block was used in 16 patients. Six patients had bilateral lesions and were treated simultaneously. The 5-year LC rate was 100%. In two patients, local recurrence was suspected at 44 and 46 months, respectively, after radiation therapy, but both of them were diagnosed to have IgG4-related inflammation by biopsy, with no evidence of malignancy upon histological and immunohistochemical examinations. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 89% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had recurrence at a distant site. The median time to recurrence was 24 months. Three of the four patients received systemic chemotherapy with R-CHOP and another patient is being followed up without second line treatment. One patient developed retinal detachment incidentally during radiation therapy and underwent surgery thereafter. There was no other Grade 3 or higher acute morbidity. Eleven patients had Grade 2 late morbidity (dry eye, 2; cataract, 9). Sixteen patients had Grade 3 cataract. No patients had severe late adverse events other than cataract. Conclusion(s): Patients with localized ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma achieved excellent local control after 30 Gy of radiation therapy alone. Local regrowth of the mass was observed in two patients, but both were diagnosed as IgG4-related disease. Association between MALT lymphoma and IgG4-related disease has been reported recently, and in such cases it should be born in mind.",Excluded

We conducted a 10-week prospective study of a convenience sample of patients transported to a level one trauma center immobilized with a backboard and cervical collar. Total backboard time (TBT) was measured from the time the ambulance left the scene to the time the patient was removed from the backboard, while total ED backboard time (TEDBT) was measured from the time of arrival at the ED to the time of backboard removal. There were 138 patients entered in the study. Insufficient data excluded 36 patients from further analysis. TBT was available for 92 patients and averaged 63.63 (+/-45.87) minutes. Dividing patients into those who were removed from the backboard prior to radiographs (n = 85), the TBT average was 53.9 minutes (+/-30.1), whereas the average for those who had radiographs prior to removal from the backboard (n = 7) was 181.3 minutes (+/-41.6).

696,"Radiation exposure and cost influence physician medical image decision making: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: It is estimated that 20%-40% of advanced medical imaging in the United States is unnecessary, resulting in patient overexposure to radiation and increasing the cost of care. Previous imaging utilization studies have focused on clinical appropriateness. An important contributor to excessive use of advanced imaging may be a physician ""knowledge gap"" regarding the safety and cost of the tests., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether safety and cost information will change physician medical image decision making., RESEARCH DESIGN: Double-blinded, randomized controlled trial. Following standardized case presentation, physicians made an initial imaging choice. This was followed by the presentation of guidelines, radiation exposure and health risk, and cost information., RESULTS: Approximately half (57 of 112, 50.9%) of participants initially selected computed tomography (CT). When presented with guideline recommendations, participants did not modify their initial imaging choice (P=0.197). A significant reduction (56.3%, P<0.001) in CT ordering occurred after presentation of radiation exposure/health risk information; ordering changed to magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound (US). A significant reduction (48.3%, P<0.001) in CT and magnetic resonance imaging ordering occurred after presentation of Medicare reimbursement information; ordering changed to US. The majority of physicians (31 of 40, 77.5%) selecting US never modified their ordering. No significant relationship between physician demographics and decision making was observed., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that physician decision making can be influenced by safety and cost information and the order in which information is provided to physicians can affect their decisions.",Excluded
2025,"Response-driven imaging biomarkers for predicting radiation necrosis of the brain. Radiation necrosis is an uncommon but severe adverse effect of brain radiation therapy (RT). Current predictive models based on radiation dose have limited accuracy. We aimed to identify early individual response biomarkers based upon diffusion tensor (DT) imaging and incorporated them into a response model for prediction of radiation necrosis. Twenty-nine patients with glioblastoma received six weeks of intensity modulated RT and concurrent temozolomide. Patients underwent DT-MRI scans before treatment, at three weeks during RT, and one, three, and six months after RT. Cases with radiation necrosis were classified based on generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) of whole brain and DT index early changes in the corpus callosum and its substructures. Significant covariates were used to develop normal tissue complication probability models using binary logistic regression. Seven patients developed radiation necrosis. Percentage changes of radial diffusivity (RD) in the splenium at three weeks during RT and at six months after RT differed significantly between the patients with and without necrosis (p = 0.05 and p = 0.01). Percentage change of RD at three weeks during RT in the 30 Gy dose-volume of the splenium and brain gEUD combined yielded the best-fit logistic regression model. Our findings indicate that early individual response during the course of RT, assessed by radial diffusivity, has the potential to aid the prediction of delayed radiation necrosis, which could provide guidance in dose-escalation trials.",Excluded

Objective: Post-operative management of pIIIA-N2 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still debated. Our objective was to identify subgroups of patients who could benefit from treatment based on invaded lymph node ratio (LNR). Method(s): From January 2003 to December 2012, 297 pIIIA-N2 NSCLC patients treated with surgery followed by conformational radiation therapy (RT) were retrospectively analysed. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 30 months. A correlation was observed between LNR and overall survival (OS) (R = -0.3, p < 0.0001), local relapse (R = -0.27, p < 0.0001) and extra-capsular spread (ECS) (Cramer's V = 0.49, p < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, OS was significantly lower in patients with LNR higher than 1/3 (median survival 61 +/- 6.5 vs. 28 +/- 3.8 months, p < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, favourable prognostic factors for OS were a LNR <1/3 (HR = 0.53, 95 % CI 0.33-0.85, p = 0.009) and microscopic N2 (HR = 0.56, 95 % CI 0.35-0.90, p = 0.01). For local relapse, multivariate analysis identified the following risk factors: female gender (HR = 2.41, CI 1.36-4.27, p = 0.003), microscopic N2 (HR = 0.40, CI 0.2-0.81, p = 0.01) and a LNR of lower than 2/3 (HR = 0.18, CI 0.07-0.48, p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Our study supports that LNR is likely related to OS and loco-regional recurrence. Furthermore, microscopic N2 seems to be associated with a better prognosis.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1848,"Cervical lymph node involvement in carcinomas of the mobile tongue in Tunisia. Retrospective study of 135 cases. OBJECTIVE: To report the profile of histologic cervical nodes involvement associated with mobile tongue squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study concerned patients treated from 1978 to 1998 by cervical neck dissection for mobile tongue carcinoma. RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded
3205,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders. The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded

Objective The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the long-Term outcome of a personalized dosimetry approach in Graves' disease aiming to render patients euthyroid from a planned thyroid absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients and methods A total of 284 patients with Graves' disease were followed prospectively following administration of radioiodine calculated to deliver an absorbed dose of 60 Gy. Patients with cardiac disease were excluded. Outcomes were analysed at yearly intervals for up to 10 years with a median follow-up of 37.5 months. Results A single radioiodine administration was sufficient to render a patient either euthyroid or hypothyroid in 175 (62%) patients, the remainder requiring further radioiodine. The median radioactivity required to deliver 60 Gy was 77 MBq. Less than 2% patients required 400-600 MBq, the standard activity administered in many centres. In the cohort receiving a single administration, 38, 32 and 26% were euthyroid on no specific thyroid medication at 3, 5 and 10 years, respectively. Larger thyroid volumes were associated with the need for further therapy. The presence of nodules on ultrasonography did not adversely affect treatment outcome. Conclusion A personalized dosimetric approach delayed the long-Term onset of hypothyroidism in 26% of patients. This was achieved using much lower administered activities than currently recommended. Future studies will aim to identify those patients who would benefit most from this approach.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded
518,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy. Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions. These results demonstrate the requirement to investigate both tumor and the host to improve the therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy.",Excluded

2711,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy. Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Data of more than 400 consecutive patients being irradiated at our department between 1994 and 1997 because of vertebral metastases were reviewed. Ninety-six patients fulfilled selection criteria including motoric deficits, no preceding surgical or radiotherapeutic treatment of the spine, minimum total dose of 24 Gy referred to spinal cord, and additional treatment with dexamethasone. Two subgroups with a similar number of patients for better comparability were formed according to the time of developing motoric deficits: 1 to 13 days (49 patients) and >=14 days (47 patients). Effect of irradiation on motoric function was evaluated 2 weeks and about 3 months after radiotherapy. Patients with severe deterioration of motoric function within 48 hours before radiation therapy (31 patients) were looked at separately. Result(s): Two weeks after radiotherapy 42/47 patients (89%) developing motoric deficits >= 14 days showed improvement of motoric function in comparison to 6/49 patients (12%) of the other group. Deterioration occurred in 1/47 patients (2%) of the first and in 24/49 patients (49%) of the latter group.

About 3 months after radiotherapy comparable results were observed. Median survival time was 4 months. Conclusion(s): A slower development of motoric deficits before beginning of radiotherapy means a better therapeutic effect and a more favorable functional outcome after treatment. The prognosis is extraordinarily poor if severe deterioration of motoric function occurs within 48 hours before radiotherapy.",Excluded
1716,"Beta endovascular brachytherapy using CO2-filled centering catheter for treatment of recurrent superficial femoropopliteal artery disease. BACKGROUND: Recurrent disease (restenosis) after endovascular treatment of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) remains a major problem. We evaluated the efficacy of beta-endovascular brachytherapy using the CORONA centering catheter in patients with SFA restenosis in a single-arm Phase II trial., METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 28 patients (mean age 70 years; 16 female, 12 male) with recurrent SFA stenosis were treated, and in-stent restenosis was present in 17 patients (61%). Brachytherapy was performed with strontium-90 beta source using a 7-French CO(2)-filled one-segment centering catheter. New stents had to be applied in two cases. Mean interventional length was 129 mm (range 20-240 mm). A dose of 14 Gy in vessel radius (postinterventional) plus 2 mm was applied in 24 patients and 18.4 Gy in four patients. Treatment time was 7 min 32 s per radiation segment. No major adverse events occurred. Patients were followed by ankle-brachial index and duplex sonography for a median of 42 months. Cumulative restenosis rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 9%, 28%, and 40%, respectively. Target vessel revascularization was performed in seven cases (25%)., CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to literature data, the treatment of SFA restenosis with beta brachytherapy may improve long-term patency.",Excluded
1497,"Diagnostic value of iterative reconstruction algorithm in low kV CT angiography (CTA) with low contrast medium volume for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) planning: image quality and radiation dose exposure. OBJECTIVE: : To evaluate image quality and radiation dose exposure of low-kV (100 kV) and low contrast medium (CM) volume CT angiography (CTA) in patients candidate to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), in comparison with standard CTA protocol., METHODS: : 79 patients candidate for TAVI were prospectively enrolled in this study and examined with 256-MDCT. 42 patients were evaluated using study-group protocol (100 kV; whole-body retrospective ECG-gating; with 50 ml of CM; iterative reconstruction algorithm) while 37 patients underwent a standard CTA study (120 kV; ECG-gating for chest; 100 ml of CM; FBP reconstruction). Overall image quality was evaluated using a 4-point scale. Vascular enhancement (HU) was then assessed in each patient by manually drawing multiple ROIs in lumen of 7 segments of the whole aorta. The radiation dose exposure of both groups was calculated and all data were compared and statistically analyzed., RESULTS:: On low-kV protocol, higher mean attenuation values were achieved in all the measurements as compared to standard protocol. There were no significant differences in the image quality evaluation in both groups. Mean radiation dose value of study group was significantly lower than in control group (reduction of 20%)., CONCLUSION: : Low kV and low CM volume CTA protocols allow TAVI planning to be carried out with high quality images and a significant reduction in the radiation dose as compared to the standard CTA protocol., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: : Low-kV CTA for pre-operative assessment of patients candidates for TAVI, permits to achieve a significant reduction of radiation dose exposure and contrast medium volume, reducing the risk of contrast induced nephropathy.",Excluded
3153,"Femoral artery dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs (canis lupus familiaris). Background: In Veterinary Medicine, there are several methods for early and accurate assessment of blood flow dynamics. The Dopplerfluxometry can access the peak systolic velocity, mean velocity and end diastolic velocity, including Resistive Index and Pulsatility Index. Normal values of Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs allow the identification of vascular abnormalities and authors' knowledge there are no reference regarding the values of Dopplerfluxometry of the femoral artery in healthy dogs. The aim of the study was to assess the femoral Dopplerfluxometry of adult healthy dogs by Resistive Index, Pulsatility Index, systolic and diastolic velocities, and femoral artery diameter. Materials, Methods & Results: Eighteen healthy intact beagle dogs, male and female, aging from 2 to 4 years old (mean +/- SD: mean 3 +/- 0.8 years), weighing from 10.1-17.9 kg [22.3-39.5 lb] [mean +/- SD: 14.3 +/- 2.7 kg (31.5 +/- 5.96 lb)] were used. The dogs underwent to physical examination, complete blood cell count, serum biochemistry examination urinalysis, and radiographs examination, muscular and cardiac evaluation. Females had to be in anestrous. All dogs were submitted to right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry. The dogs were positioned in dorsal recumbency by one person without any chemical restraint. A high definition ultrasound device equipped with a 3 - 13 MHz multi-frequency linear transducer was used. The right femoral artery was identified with the transducer positioned transversely on the right triangle femoral area. Peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity was measured. The Resistivity Index and Pulsatility Index were calculated automatically by the ultrasound machine software. Three measurements were obtained with the Doppler spectrum. The values of peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, Resistivity Index, Pulsatility Index and femoral artery diameter were expressed as Mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD). Discussion(s): No studies regarding to femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in healthy dogs were found in the literature. These results can be used as normal reference values of Dopplerfluxometric parameters for adult dogs. The literature cited only Dopplerfluxometric values of renal arteries, abdominal aorta and of the internal thoracic artery. The normal values of arterial Dopplerfluxometry is necessary to identify the spectral quantitative characteristics of the blood flow for diagnosis and prognosis of vascular diseases. Authors referred to changes in blood perfusion by Dopplerfluxometry examination, but no changes in B-mode ultrasonography. The femoral Resistivity Index values can be used to correlate the postoperative evolution in dogs submitted to femoral bone, hip and knee surgeries, since Dopplerfluxometry allows blood flow assessment in the femoral region muscles. Changes in the heart rate, blood pressure, stress, exercise, and diseases as hypotension, renal lesion, hepatic diseases, diabetes, hyperadrenocorticism can change the Dopplerfluxometric parameters. All dogs which used in this study were clinically healthy, and were used beagle dogs due to lowest variations within breed. Sedation was avoid due to possible changes in Dopplerfluxometric parameters since the use of sedation or tranquilization in animals is strongly discussed due to possible hemodynamic changes that may occur during the examination. In conclusion, the mean values of the right femoral artery Dopplerfluxometry in male and female adult healthy dogs is Resistivity Index (0.887); Pulsatility Index (1.599); peak systolic velocity (124.41 cm/s), end-diastolic velocity (14.12 cm/s), femoral artery diameter (3.9 mm).Copyright © 2018 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

745,"Surgeons' exposure to radiation in single- and multi- level minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion; a prospective study. Although minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) has widely been developed in patients with lumbar diseases, surgeons risk exposure to fluoroscopic radiation. However, to date, there is no studies quantifying the effective dose during MIS-TLIF procedure, and the radiation dose distribution is still unclear. In this study, the surgeons' radiation doses at 5 places on the bodies were measured and the effective doses were assessed during 31 consecutive 1- to 3-level MIS-TLIF surgeries. The operating surgeon, assisting surgeon, and radiological technologist wore thermoluminescent dosimeter on the unshielded thyroid, chest, genitals, right middle finger, and on the chest beneath a lead apron. The doses at the lens and the effective doses were also calculated. Mean fluoroscopy times were 38.7, 53.1, and 58.5 seconds for 1, 2, or 3 fusion levels, respectively. The operating surgeon's mean exposures at the lens, thyroid, chest, genitals, finger, and the chest beneath the shield, respectively, were 0.07, 0.07, 0.09, 0.14, 0.32, and 0.05 mSv in 1-level MIS-TLIF; 0.07, 0.08, 0.09, 0.18, 0.34, and 0.05 mSv in 2-level; 0.08, 0.09, 0.14, 0.15, 0.36, and 0.06 mSv in 3-level; and 0.07, 0.08, 0.10, 0.15, 0.33, and 0.05 mSv in all cases. Mean dose at the operating surgeon's right finger was significantly higher than other measurements parts (P,0.001). The operating surgeon's effective doses (0.06, 0.06, and 0.07 mSv for 1, 2, and 3 fusion levels) were low, and didn't differ significantly from those of the assisting surgeon or radiological technologist. Revision MIS-TLIF was not associated with higher surgeons' radiation doses compared to primary MIS-TLIF. There were significantly higher surgeons' radiation doses in over-weight than in normal-weight patients. The surgeons' radiation exposure during MIS-TLIF was within the safe level by the International Commission on Radiological Protection's guidelines. The accumulated radiation exposure, especially to surgeon's hands, should be carefully monitored. © 2014 Funao et al.",Excluded
3460,"Malignant angioglioma: Clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features. Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent malignant neoplasm in the adult brain. In contrast, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are presumably congenital lesions, usually presenting with hemorrhage. Hypervascular low-grade gliomas associated with AVMs were previously called angioglioma. An association of AVMs and GBM was also described. Study Aims We discuss the data of the largest series of locally coincident GBM with AVM in a single institution so far. All analyses were explorative only. Patients We report a series of four patients presenting at our department from 2006 to 2014. All patients underwent surgery. The cases were analyzed regarding initial presentation, clinical findings, tumor localization, and histopathologic results. Conclusions A local coincidence of cerebral AVM and GBM is rare. Only a few reports can be found in the literature. The radiologic as well as the clinical presentations are individual. Proangiogenic factors are discussed as involved in the appearance of both entities in the same location. However, the presence of pathologic vessels within malignant gliomas is well known to all neurosurgeons and proangiogenic activity has been proven. Therefore, it seems possible that tumor activity itself contributes to the pathogenesis of a vascular malformation.Copyright © 2020 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1700,"Effectiveness of Nd: YAG laser therapy on Japanese cedar pollinosis. Many have reported on the effectiveness of laser surgery therapy for perennial allergic rhinitis. However, the suppressive effects of laser irradiation on allergic rhinitis and its symptoms have not been reported in patients with pollinosis. This is because therapeutic effects on pollinosis are difficult to evaluate. The amount of pollen in the air varies during the year, and from year to year. Also, allergic symptoms develop due to exposure to the amount of pollen which is markedly influenced by the weather. In this study, the severity of allergic symptoms in the pollen season was compared between patients treated with early medication, non-treated patients and patients treated with preseasonal contact Nd: YAG laser surgery. Results suggests that laser surgery was effective in reducing the severity of symptoms in patients with cedar pollinosis. Symptoms were milder in the laser group than in the medication group and non-treated group for 3-4 weeks after the start of seasonal pollinosis, although no differences were noted in the early weeks. This may be explained by the fact that laser irradiation reduces the lamina propria of the nasal mucosa, the site of allergic reactions. This also suggests that allergic pollen can't penetrate the mucosal surface which shows squamous epithelization after laser irradiation.",Excluded
1124,"A system for in vivo measurement of bone calcium by local neutron activation of the hand. A 252Cf neutron-irradiation facility designed specifically for clinical in vivo measurement of calcium in the hand is described. Results of preliminary measurements are presented. Hand phantoms were exposed to the neutron beam for 10 min and the induced 49Ca activities were counted for 10 min after an elapsed time of 2 min. The results indicate that with a 2 X 100 micrograms 252Cf neutron source and two 20.3 X 12.7 cm NaI crystals, the counts per gram of bone mineral mass changes by about 4% for each 100 cm3 change in the overall volume (soft tissue plus bone) of the hand. For hands of equal volumes the counts per gram are expected to be almost independent of the bone volume. With an absorbed dose equivalent of 150 mSv (15 rem), the sensitivity is about 200 counts per 10 min per gram Ca. The statistical reproducibility of the results is better than 3% for the average value of 11 g Ca in the normal hand.",Excluded
2040,"Ultraviolet polarisation sensitivity in the stomatopod crustacean Odontodactylus scyllarus. The ommatidia of crustacean eyes typically contain two classes of photoreceptors with orthogonally oriented microvilli. These receptors provide the basis for two-channel polarisation vision in the blue-green spectrum. The retinae of gonodactyloid stomatopod crustaceans possess a great variety of structural specialisations for elaborate polarisation vision. One type of specialisation is found in the small, distally placed R8 cells within the two most ventral rows of the mid-band. These ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors produce parallel microvilli, a feature suggestive for polarisation-sensitive photoreceptors. Here, we show by means of intracellular recordings combined with dye-injections that in the gonodactyloid species Odontodactylus scyllarus, the R8 cells of mid-band rows 5 and 6 are sensitive to linear polarised ultraviolet light. We show that mid-band row 5 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented parallel to the mid-band, whereas mid-band row 6 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented perpendicular to the mid-band. This orthogonal arrangement of ultraviolet-sensitive receptor cells could support ultraviolet polarisation vision. R8 cells of rows 5 and 6 are known to act as quarter-wave retarders around 500 nm and thus are the first photoreceptor type described with a potential dual role in polarisation vision.",Excluded
951,"Oxygen consumption during walking and running under fractional weight bearing conditions. INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively ""easier"" it is to exercise.",Excluded
2984,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose. The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL.",Excluded
1158,"Human mandible bone defect repair by the grafting of dental pulp stem/progenitor cells and collagen sponge biocomplexes. In this study we used a biocomplex constructed from dental pulp stem/progenitor cells (DPCs) and a collagen sponge scaffold for oro-maxillo-facial (OMF) bone tissue repair in patients requiring extraction of their third molars. The experiments were carried out according to our Internal Ethical Committee Guidelines and written informed consent was obtained from the patients. The patients presented with bilateral bone reabsorption of the alveolar ridge distal to the second molar secondary to impaction of the third molar on the cortical alveolar lamina, producing a defect without walls, of at least 1.5 cm in height. This clinical condition does not permit spontaneous bone repair after extraction of the third molar, and eventually leads to loss also of the adjacent second molar. Maxillary third molars were extracted first for DPC isolation and expansion. The cells were then seeded onto a collagen sponge scaffold and the obtained biocomplex was used to fill in the injury site left by extraction of the mandibular third molars. Three months after autologous DPC grafting, alveolar bone of patients had optimal vertical repair and complete restoration of periodontal tissue back to the second molars, as assessed by clinical probing and X-rays. Histological observations clearly demonstrated the complete regeneration of bone at the injury site. Optimal bone regeneration was evident one year after grafting. This clinical study demonstrates that a DPC/collagen sponge biocomplex can completely restore human mandible bone defects and indicates that this cell population could be used for the repair and/or regeneration of tissues and organs.",Excluded
3227,"Celecoxib and radioresistant glioblastoma-derived CD133+ cells: Improvement in radiotherapeutic effects. Laboratory investigation. Object. Glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor, has a poor prognosis, even with aggressive resection and chemoradiotherapy. Recent studies indicate that CD133+ cells play a key role in radioresistance and recurrence of glioblastoma. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, including CD133+ glioblastomas. The COX-2-derived prostaglandins promote neovascularization during tumor development, and conventional radiotherapy increases the proportion of CD133+ cells rather than eradicating them. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, in enhancing the therapeutic effects of radiation on CD133+ glioblastomas. Methods. Cells positive for CD133 were isolated from glioblastoma specimens and characterized by flow cytometry, then treated with celecoxib and/or ionizing radiation (IR). Clonogenic assay, cell irradiation, cell cycle analysis, Western blot, and xenotransplantation were used to assess the effects of celecoxib alone, IR alone, and IR with celecoxib on CD133+ and CD133- glioblastoma cells. Three separate xenotransplantation experiments were carried out using 310 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice: 1) an initial tumorigenicity evaluation in which 3 different quantities of untreated CD133- cells or untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells (5 treatment conditions) from 7 different tumors were injected into the striatum of 2 mice (210 mice total); 2) a tumor growth study (50 mice); and 3) a survival study (50 mice). For these last 2 studies the same 5 categories of cells were used as in the tumorigenicity (untreated CD133 - cells, untreated or pretreated CD133+ cells, with pretreatment consisting of celecoxib alone, IR alone, or IR and celecoxib), but only 1 cell source (Case 2) and quantity (5 x 104 cells) were used. Results. High levels of COX-2 protein were detected in the CD133 + but not the CD133- glioblastoma cells. The authors further demonstrated that 30 mM celecoxib was able to effectively enhance the IR effect in inhibiting colony formation and increasing IR-mediated apoptosis in celecoxib-treated CD133+ glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, reduction in radioresistance was correlated with the induction of G2/M arrest, which was partially mediated through the increase in the level of phosphorylated-cdc2. In vivo xenotransplant analysis further confirmed that CD133+-associated tumorigenicity was significantly suppressed by celecoxib treatment. Importantly, pretreatment of CD133+ glioblastoma cells with a combination of celecoxib and IR before injection into the striatum of SCID mice resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth and a statistically significant increase in the mean survival rate of the mice. Conclusions. Celecoxib combined with radiation plays a critical role in the suppression of growth of CD133+ glioblastoma stemlike cells. Celecoxib is therefore a radiosensitizing drug for clinical application in glioblastoma.",Excluded
1495,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model. Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded
2002,"Use of electrocardiogram to position right atrial catheters during surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the accuracy of placing right atrial catheters using an electrocardiographic (ECG) technique., SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Placement of right atrial catheters for vascular access is a common operative procedure. Accurate placement is essential for proper function. Previous placement techniques have used fluoroscopy, which is both time consuming and hazardous., METHODS: The accuracy of placement of 1236 right atrial catheters using an ECG technique was compared to placement of 586 catheters using fluoroscopy between March 1991 and November 1995. In the ECG technique, the catheter was flushed with sodium bicarbonate. A sterile left-leg ECG lead was attached to the catheter with the other ECG leads applied normally. On advancing the catheter through the superior vena cava, the P-wave amplitude (lead II) increased in negative deflection until greater than the QRS complex. Passing the sinoatrial node, the P-wave developed an initial positive then negative deflection. The catheter was positioned so the P-wave was biphasic, representing a position midway between the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. For the fluoroscopic technique, catheters were positioned under direct observation just within the atrium estimated from cardiac contour. Use of contrast was optional if atrial anatomy was unclear., RESULTS: Postoperative portable chest x-rays showed the ECG method to position the catheter tip within the right atrium just as accurately (average, 1.9 +/- 1.3 cm) as with the use of fluoroscopy (average, 1.1 +/- 1.6 cm). The ECG method eliminated an average of 20 seconds of radiation exposure, an average of 3.0 minutes operating room time (p < 0.04), avoided all risks of contrast dye, and saved $279.10 per case., CONCLUSIONS: The ECG method is a satisfactory alternative to that of fluoroscopy for placement of long-term central venous catheters into the right atrium.",Excluded

Fifty-eight of 87 tumors (66.7%) were located in the skull base. The remaining 29 meningiomas (33.3%) were located in the convexity of the brain. The median tumor volume was 4.8 ml (range, 0.2-18.3 ml). The median tumor surface dose, maximal dose, and therapeutic isodose were 12 Gy, 16 Gy, and 75%, respectively. Results For retrospective evaluation, we included 70 patients (78 tumors) with a minimum radiological follow-up of 24 months. After a median follow-up of 79.7 months (range, 24.2-109.1 months), 24 patients (34.3%) improved in their clinical status (paresis of N. abducens 18/48, facial paresis 4/8, and hemiparesis 2/9), 41 patients remained stable (58.6%), three patients had treatment-related temporary complaints (4.3%); two patients developed vertigo, and one had a leftsided hemihypesthesia. All complaints recovered completely after steroid medication within 2 weeks. Two patients (2.8%) developed permanent trigeminal neuralgia. Follow-up MR images showed a partial remission in 21 tumors (26.9%) and a stable tumor size in 55 cases (70.5%).

931,"New dose constraint reduces radiation-induced fatal pneumonitis in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Background. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allows treatment of patients with large tumour volumes, but radiation pneumonitis (RP) remains a dose limiting complication. The incidence of severe RP using three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy, was previously reported to be 17%, with 2% lethal RP. The aim of this study was to monitor the incidence of RP following the introduction of IMRT.Material and methods. IMRT was delivered using 4-8 beam arrangements and introduced in three phases. In phase I, 12 patients were treated using only one dose constraint (V20), in which the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy was limited to 40%. In phase II, 25 patients were treated with an additional dose constraint of mean lung dose (MLD) <= 20 Gy. In phase III, 50 patients were treated with an extra dose constraint (V5) in which the total lung volume receiving a dose of 5 Gy was <= 60%. RP was prospectively documented. The results of phase I & II (IMRT-1) were compared to those in phase III (IMRT-2).Results. The median follow-up time was 17 months. The introduction of IMRT was associated with an increase in the incidence of RP in Phase I&II (IMRT-1) to 41%, six of 37 (16%) had grade 5 RP (IMRT-1). Introducing the dose constraint V5, led to a significant reduction in the lung volume receiving doses <= 20 Gy from 51 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 1% (p < 0.0001). Introducing V5 constraint did not decrease the incidence of severe (grade >= 3) RP, but significantly decreased the lethal pneumonitis to 4% (two of 50 patients), p = 0.05.Conclusion. Introducing IMRT resulted in an increase in the incidence of severe and fatal RP, however a new dose constraint to the volume of lung receiving low doses reduced the incidence of lethal pneumonitis.Copyright © 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
978,"New radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC-SC) for chemo-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis. Purpose/Objective: Linear accelerator-based radiotherapy has little effect on most of locally-advanced neoplasmas that have grown to several centimeters or more. Such tumors contain numerous hypoxic cancer cells and/or large amounts of anti-oxidative enzymes, and are therefore resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays and electrons from linear accelerators (Linac). We have developed a new radiosensitizer containing hydrogen peroxide & sodium hyaluronate for topical tumor injection for various types of tumors which are not superficially exposed, and the method was named 'KORTUC II'. Safety and effectiveness of the method have already been successfully performed by our clinical trials for patients with unresectable and/or recurrent neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of KORTUC II specifically for patients with chemotherapy-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis, and the method was named as KORTUC-SC (KORTUC for supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis). For these lesions, curative resection is impossible because of the direct invasion of neoplasms to surrounding cervical great vessels. Therefore new strategies for better local control have been needed. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was performed at Kochi Medical School Hospital between September 2006 and March 2010. Twelve patients (2 men,10 women) with chemotherapy-resistant supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were enrolled into the study after providing fully informed written consent. All the patients underwent PET-CT examinations prior to and at 3 ~ 6 months after KORTUC-SC. We compared these two examination results. Patients were 58 to 77 years old (average age was 65).The radiotherapy regimen was 4 Gy/time, 3 times/week, for 4 weeks, and total dose was 48 Gy. The appropriate energy level of electron beams was selected for individual patients in terms of depth of the target lesion. The injection of 3 to 6 ml of the agent was started from the 5th session of radiotherapy, and was performed twice a week under ultrasonographic guidance. Result(s): The numbers of the patients were 12. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by the FDG-PET performed prior to and following the KORTUC-SC treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) showed complete response (CR), 1 (8.3%) showed partial response (PR), 3 (25%) showed stable disease(SD), and another 2 (16.6%) showed progressive disease (PD). Overall survival rate was 83% at 1 year (10/12 patients) and 75% at 2 years (9/12 patients). The mean duration of follow-up at the end of February 2011 was 35.1 months. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of FDG-PET study, remarkable therapeutic effects of the KORTUC II treatment for chemotherapyresistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis (KORTUC-SC) were clearly identified. The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local pain at the injection site. The treatment outcomes were satisfactory and the adverse events were within the permissible range. This therapy is much less expensive than molecular-targeted therapies in current use, such as Cetuximab. Some well designed prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of KORTUC-SC.",Excluded
3122,"Automated identification and grading of coronary artery stenoses with X-ray angiography. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: X-ray coronary angiography (XCA) remains the gold standard imaging technique for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Automatic detection and grading of coronary stenoses in XCA are challenging problems due to the complex overlap of different background structures with intensity inhomogeneities. We present a new computerized image based method to accurately identify and quantify the stenosis severity on XCA., METHODS: A unified framework, consisting of Hessian-based vessel enhancement, level-set skeletonization, improved measure of match measurement, and local extremum identification, is developed to distinctly reveal the vessel structures and accurately determine the stenosis grades. The methodology was validated on 143 consecutive patients who underwent diagnostic XCA through both qualitative and quantitative evaluations., RESULTS: The presented algorithm was tested on a set of 267 vessel segments annotated by two expert cardiologists. The experimental results show that the method can effectively localize and quantify the vessel stenoses, achieving average detection accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F-score of 93.93%, 91.03%, 93.83%, 89.18%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: A fully automatic coronary analysis method is devised for vessel stenosis detection and grading in XCA. The presented approach can potentially serve as a generalized framework to handle different image modalities. Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1305,"Development of gravity-sensing organs in altered gravity. Experiments are described in which the development of the gravity-sensing organs was studied in newt larvae reared in microgravity on the IML-2 mission and in Aplysia embryos and larvae reared on a centrifuge at 1 to 5 g. In Aplysia embryos, the statolith (single dense mass on which gravity and linear acceleration act) was reduced in size in a graded fashion at increasing g. In early post-metamorphic Aplysia or even in isolated statocysts from such animals, the number of statoconia produced is reduced at high g. Newt larvae launched before any of the otoconia were formed and reared for 15 days in microgravity had nearly adult labyrinths at the end of the IML-2 mission. The otoliths of the saccule and utricle were the same size in flight and ground-reared larvae. However, the system of aragonitic otoconia produced in the endolymphatic sac in amphibians was much larger and developed earlier in the flight-reared larvae. At later developmental stages, the aragonitic otoconia enter and fill the saccule. One flight-reared larva was maintained for nine months post-flight and the size of the saccular otolith, as well as the volume of otoconia within the endolymphatic sac, were considerably larger than in age-matched, ground-reared newts. This suggests that rearing in microgravity initiates a process that continues for several months after introduction to 1-g, which greatly increases the volume of otoconia. The flight-reared animal had abnormal posture, pointing its head upward, whereas normal ground-reared newts always keep their head horizontal. This suggests that rearing for even a short period in microgravity can have lasting functional consequences in an animal subsequently reared in 1-g conditions on Earth.",Excluded
1911,"Dose-escalated intensity modulated radiation therapy in patients with locally-advanced vulvar cancer - does it increase response rate?. PURPOSE: GOG 205 safely increased clinical (cCR) and pathologic complete response (pCR) in locally-advanced vulvar cancer through dose escalation using three-dimensional radiotherapy (RT). The aim of this study is to assess the response of dose-escalated intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in locally-advanced vulvar cancer., METHODS: A retrospective review of patients treated with dose-escalated (>= 55Gy) IMRT from 2012 to 2018 for locally-advanced vulvar cancer was performed. Patients treated with preoperative or definitive intent were included. Rates of cCR and pCR were assessed, and predictors of disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Kaplan Meier method with log rank test between groups and a parsimonious multivariate Cox model., RESULTS: Median dose to the vulva was 66.0 Gy (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 66.0-68.0) for definitive and 59.4 Gy (IQR: 58.0-59.4) for preoperative IMRT. The overall rates of cCR and pCR were 76% and 70%, respectively. DFS at two years was 65% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 50-80%) for all patients, 81% (95% CI 63% - 98%) for definitive IMRT, and 55% (95% CI 35% - 76%) for preoperative IMRT. On multivariate analysis, cCR predicted for disease-free survival (HR 0.21; 95% CI 0.06-0.76; p = 0.02), and pCR predicted for OS (HR 0.12; 95% CI 0.02-0.60; p = 0.01). Grade 3 acute and late RT toxicity was seen in 14 (29%) and 3 (6%) of patients, respectively., CONCLUSION: Dose-escalated IMRT for locally-advanced vulvar cancer is well tolerated, with rates of cCR and pCR that compare favorably with published data.

2250,"The impact of tumor volume and radiotherapy dose on outcome in previously irradiated recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy. Purpose: To assess the effect of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) dose and tumor volume on outcomes in patients with recurrent, previously irradiated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 96 patients with recurrent, previously irradiated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were treated with SBRT using Cyberknife and Trilogy-intensity- modulated radiosurgery. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to estimate locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival rates. Response was evaluated using positron emission tomography/computed tomography or computed tomography and detailed physical examination. Result(s): The median follow-up for all patients was 14 months (2-39 months). The median dose of prior radiation was 68.4 Gy (32-170 Gy). Patients were divided into 4 SBRT dose groups: I (15-28 Gy/n = 29), II (30-36 Gy/n = 22), III (40 Gy/n = 18), and IV (44-50 Gy/n = 27). The median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 24.3 cm3 (2.5-162 cm). For GTV <=25 cm3 (n = 50), complete response rates were 27.8%/30%/45.5%/45.5%, and for GTV >25 cm3 (n = 46), complete response rates were 20%/25%/42.8%/50% for SBRT groups I-IV, respectively. The 1-/2-/3-year LRC rates for doses 40 to 50 Gy were 69.4%/57.8%/41.1%, respectively, whereas for 15 to 36 Gy, they were 51.9%/31.7%/15.9%, respectively (P = 0.02). The overall 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 58.9% and 28.4%, respectively. Treatment was well tolerated with no grade 4/5 toxicities. Conclusion(s): Dose escalation up to 50 Gy in 5 fractions is feasible with SBRT for recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Higher SBRT doses were associated with significantly higher LRC rates. Large tumor volume required higher SBRT doses to achieve optimal response rates compared with smaller tumor volume.

12,"Efficacy of three-dimensional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (3D CE-MRA) in the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of various upper extremity positions (adduction-abduction) on vascular structures in contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiographic studies performed in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-two consecutive patients with clinical symptoms of neurovascular thoracic outlet syndrome were examined by 1.0 T MR unit. Examinations were studied by three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography with the arms positioned in abduction and adduction in the same patients. Result(s): In twenty-one of 44 subclavian arteries, impingement or stenosis with different degrees were found. Majority of lesions were localized in the costoclavicular region. Venous phase sequences of contrast-enhanced MR angiography showed compression of the subclavian vein in the 17 areas. Conclusion(s): Thoracic outlet syndrome remains controversial in both diagnosis and treatment, particulary in patients with no muscle atrophy, hand ischemia findings or venous stasis symptoms. Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography is noninvasive and requires neither ionizing radiation nor administration of iodinated contrast material- and may be used to diagnose early compression findings and stenosis of the subclavian vessels. © Trakya University Faculty of Medicine.",Excluded
3711,"Chronic radiodermatitis following repeated percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. We review three patients who developed chronic radiodermatitis subsequent to undergoing multiple percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCAs). All patients had had chronic ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and had undergone lengthy PTCA on several occasions. The skin eruption was characterized by an atrophic rectangular plaque on the left upper back, presenting as mottled hyper- and hypopigmentation with reticulate telangiectasia. Histologically, the eruption demonstrated epidermal atrophy, hyalinized and irregularly stained collagen, and telangiectasia of superficial vessels in the dermis. Although the risk of radiation injury in most patients undergoing cardiac catheterization is low, this danger should not be ignored. In particular, patients with long-standing IHD and numerous repeated catheterizations to only one or two occluded coronary arteries should be considered at high risk.",Excluded
1954,"[Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancers with bilateral irradiation of the neck : preliminary results]. PURPOSE: To report preliminary results of a prospective study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) with bilateral irradiation of the neck., PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the Alexis Vautrin Cancer Center, 23 patients have been treated with IMRT for HNC since January 2002-August 2003. The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were <4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses <26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia., CONCLUSION: The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years.",Excluded

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the therapeutic outcome of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) patients in different risk groups in one institute. Method(s): A total of 1,759 PTC patients were categorized into low-(n = 1,123), intermediate-(n = 75), and high-risk (n = 561) groups according to tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Result(s): Of the patients, 15.1% presented with lymph node metastases, and 4.6% presented with distant metastases at the time of thyroid operation. After 8.0 +/- 0.1 years of follow-up, 73 (4.2%) patients died of thyroid cancer. Tumor size, local invasion, and lymph node metastases adversely influenced recurrence and survival. Of the patients in the 3 groups, 9 (0.8%), 8 (10.7%), and 56 (10.0%) died of thyroid cancer, respectively. In addition, 88 (7.8%), 14 (18.7%), and 144 (25.8%) patients showed recurrence during the follow-up period. Patients with highly aggressive histological patterns showed increased recurrence and cancer mortality compared with the low-risk group; otherwise, values were not higher than those of the high-risk group.

To define relevant disease parameters and their respective limits indicating the initiation of TNF-alpha-blockers in individual patients. Subsequently, to analyze retrospectively patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or ankylosing spondylitis (AS), who started TNF-alpha inhibition in 2006. Points to consider, regarded relevant for individual treatment decisions as well as their assessment methods, were ascertained by experts' consensus applying the Delphi technique. Subsequently, these parameters' thresholds with respect to the initiation of a TNF-alpha-blocker were identified. Thereafter, the rheumatologists representing 12 centres all over Austria agreed to retrospectively analyze their patients started on a TNF-alpha-blocker in 2006. Experts' opinion regarding disease parameters relevant to initiate TNF-alpha-blockers in RA patients only slightly differed from those applied in clinical trials, but the parameters' threshold values were considerably lower. For PsA patients, some differences and for AS patients, considerable differences between experts' opinion and clinical studies appeared, which held also true for decisive parameters' means and thresholds. Six hundred and fifty patients, started on TNF-blockers in 2006, could be analyzed retrospectively, 408 RA patients (53.3 years mean, 340 females), 93 PsA patients (48.9 years mean, 59 males) and 149 AS patients AS (42.2 years mean, 108 males), representing approximately 25% of all Austrian patients initiated on a TNF-blocker in this respective year.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the feasibility of 70-kVp high-pitch non-ECG-gated thoracic aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) with 40-mL contrast agent compared to 100-kVp standard-pitch CTA with 60-mL contrast agent., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven patients (51 men and 16 women; mean age, 55 +/- 14 years) received non-ECG-gated aortic CTA at 70 kVp, high pitch of 3.4, and 40-mL contrast agent (group A, n = 31) or CTA at 100-kVp, pitch of 1.2, and 60-mL contrast agent (group B, n = 36). Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05). Interreader agreement was good or excellent for image quality assessment (k = 0.625-0.835). The 70-kVp CTA protocol, which allows dose reduction of 85%, was considered diagnostic in all instances by two readers., CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed thoracic aortic CTA protocol provides diagnostic information with substantial reduction of both radiation and contrast agent doses compared to standard-pitch CTA at 100 kVp.

PURPOSE: The objective of the study was to determine if mouthwashes with a morphine-containing solution decrease oral pain associated with radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis (OM). METHOD(S): Randomized double-blinded crossover study to evaluate the effect of topical oral application of 2 per thousand morphine solution in patients suffering from radiotherapy- and/or chemotherapy-induced OM. Participants assigned to either the morphine solution or a placebo mouthwash received one of the solutions days 1-3 and were then switched over to the other treatment for days 4-6. RESULT(S): Nine patients were randomized in both groups. All patients (mean age, 55.1 +/- 3.0) except one had head and neck cancers. Mean intensity of pain associated with mucosal injury (World Health Organization [WHO] mucositis > or =2) was on a 10-point visual analogue scale: 6.0 +/- 2.7). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model that included morphine or placebo, day and time of mouthwash, and mouthwash effect shows that pain alleviation 1 hour after mouthwash was significantly influenced by the gesture of the mouthwash (p < 0.001 with either morphine or placebo) and almost by the efficiency of morphine (p = 0.020). Duration of pain relief was 123.7 (standard deviation [SD] +/- 98.2) minutes for morphine. Most other reported symptoms were present at the baseline and were probably associated with the main disease and not secondary to the morphine mouthwash. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest a possible analgesic effect of topical morphine in line with previous studies. However, more efforts must be made for the adjustment of systemic analgesics and the development of new alternatives to treat locally OM-associated pain.",Excluded
3235,"Radiation exposure associated with dedicated renal mass computed tomography protocol: impact of patient characteristics. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Renal mass protocol CT (RMP-CT) using multiphase abdomen and pelvis CT imaging is the mainstay for diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up for renal masses; however, it is associated with ionizing radiation to the patient. We sought to quantify the effective dose associated with RMP-CT and to determine how patient factors affect radiation exposure., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 247 patients undergoing management of a small renal mass (cT1a) between 2005 and 2011 at our institution. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese (<=25, 25.1-30, 30.1-35 and >35, respectively). Effective dose of RMP-CT was calculated through the dose-length-product multiplied by a factor coefficient (0.015). Effective doses in milliSieverts (mSv) were correlated to patient characteristics., RESULTS: Patients' median age was 61 years, and median BMI was 28.7 kg/m(2); 72% were Caucasian and 56% were male. Median effective dose was 26.1 mSv (interquartile range 20.6-35.3). When stratified by BMI, the median effective doses were 18.9, 25.2, 27.7, and 36.2mSv for normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients, respectively. On multivariable analyses, BMI and male sex were significantly associated with increased radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the median effective dose for RMP-CT was 26.1 mSv. Obesity was independently associated with markedly increased radiation exposure, with morbidly obese patients being exposed to almost twice the amount of radiation compared with normal weight persons. These findings should be considered when devising management strategies in patients with a renal mass and strategies should be developed to reduce medical ionizing radiation exposure.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of CT-guided microcoil localization of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) for guiding video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2016 and October 2019, 454 consecutive patients with 501 SPNs who received CT-guided microcoil localization before VATS in our institution were enrolled. The diameter of the nodules was 0.93 +/- 0.49 cm, and the shortest distance from the nodules to the pleura was 1.41 +/- 0.95 cm. The distal end of the microcoil was placed less than 1 cm away from the nodule, and the proximal end was placed outside the visceral pleura. VATS was performed under the guidance of implanted microcoils without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy. RESULT(S): All 501 nodules were marked with microcoils. The time required for microcoil localization was 12.8 +/- 5.2 minutes. Microcoil localization-related complications occurred in 179 cases (39.4%). None of the complications required treatment. A total of 463 nodules were successfully resected under the guidance of implanted microcoils. VATS revealed 38 patients with dislocated microcoils, of which 28 underwent wedge resection (21 cases under the guidance of the bleeding points of pleural puncture, 7 cases through palpation), 5 underwent direct lobectomy, and the remaining 5 underwent a conversion to thoracotomy. In 4 cases, a portion of the microcoil remained in the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION(S): CT-guided microcoil localization of SPNs is safe and reliable. Marking the nodule and pleura simultaneously with microcoils can effectively guide the resection of SPNs using VATS without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy on the sexual health of men with >=7 years of prospective evaluation and optimum sexual function before treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 223 patients with T1b to T3a prostate cancer and a median (range) age of 66 (50-82) years were treated with permanent seed implantation from November 1990 to March 1998. They were followed for a median (range) of 8.2 (7-14.1) years using prospective quality-of-life measures. Erectile function (EF) was assessed using a physician-assigned score and beginning in June 2000; the validated International Index of EF (IIEF-5) was used as a complementary method to quantify late EF. No adjustment was made to differentiate sexual function with or with no pharmacological intervention for EF. Pearson's chi-square test and Student's t-test were used to compare the groups. RESULT(S): Of the 223 men, 131 (59%) had optimal EF before their brachytherapy; of these, 51 (40%) at the last follow-up evaluation were using either a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (44, 86%), yohimbine (two, 4%) or alprostadil (five, 10%). The age at implantation was highly predictive of current EF; 23 of 25 (92%) men aged 50-59 years had a current EF of >=2; those aged 60-69 and 70-78 years had an EF of >=2 in 48/75 (64%) and 18/31 (58%) (P = 0.01).

1975,"Parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: preserved parotid function after IMRT on quantitative salivary scintigraphy, and comparison with historical data after conventional radiotherapy. PURPOSE: To evaluate the parotid function after parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2003 to May 2004, 16 patients with nonmetastatic NPC underwent parotid-sparing IMRT. Eight of these patients had Stage III or IV NPC based on the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. The post-IMRT parotid function was evaluated by quantitative salivary scintigraphy and represented by the maximal excretion ratio (MER) of the parotid gland after sialogogue stimulation. The parotid function of 16 NPC patients who were previously treated with conventional radiotherapy was reviewed as the historical control., RESULTS: In the parotid-sparing IMRT group, all 16 patients were alive and without cancer at the end of follow-up period (median, 24.2 months). The mean parotid MER was 53.5% before radiotherapy, 10.7% at 1 month post-IMRT, and 23.3% at 9 months post-IMRT. In the conventional radiotherapy group, the mean parotid MER was 0.6% at 6 to 12 months postradiotherapy. The difference was statistically significant (23.3% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In the IMRT group, the mean parotid doses ranged from 33.2 Gy to 58.8 Gy (average, 43.9 Gy). The correlation between the mean parotid dose and the percentage decrease of parotid MER at 9 months post-IMRT (dMER) was statically significant (p=0.008, Pearson correlation)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean parotid doses are relatively high, the significant preservation of parotid function is achieved with IMRT for NPC patients. The significant correlation between mean parotid dose and parotid dMER demonstrates the dose-function relationship of the parotid gland.",Excluded
2221,"Value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting pathological stages and therapeutic responses to chemoradiotherapy in lower rectal cancer. Aim: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has the potential to reveal intra-tumor structural heterogeneity consisting of stroma through an evaluation of uniformity on DWI. In present study, we examined the diagnostic value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by DWI in lower rectal cancer (LRC). Patients and Methods: A total of 172 LRC patients underwent radical surgery between 2009 and 2017. T1 tumors and cases without pre-operative MRI were excluded. Twenty-nine primary resection cases (PR) and 37 pre-operative chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery cases (pCRT) were targeted. Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI was quantified using a specific formula (HSD). Structural heterogeneity was objectively quantified by an image analysis of resected specimens using a digital microscope (HSP). The relationships between HSD and HSP, pathological factors, and tumor regression grades (TRG) of pCRT were evaluated. Result(s): The relationship between HSD and HSP was analyzed by a linear regression model in PR cases, revealing a positive correlation (R2=0.43). PR cases were divided into HSD-high and HSD-low according to the median. There were more pT3 or N(+) cases in HSD-high (p=0.038, 0.095). HSD before pCRT correlated with TRG (grade 1 versus 2/3) in pCRT cases (p=0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of HSD for predicting T and N stages and therapeutic grades was evaluated by cut-off values calculated using a ROC curve and revealed that each factor may be accurately diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI corresponded with stromal pathological heterogeneity. It is useful for predicting T3 or deeper tumor invasion, pathological N(+), and the therapeutic effects of pCRT.Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded
2437,"Combination of EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibition by BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 with irradiation in FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of the dual EGFR/HER2 (ErbB2) tyrosine kinase inhibitors BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 on proliferation and clonogenic cell survival of FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma in vitro, and on tumor growth after single-dose irradiation in nude mice., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell proliferation, cell-cycle distribution and clonogenic cell survival after irradiation were assayed with and without BIBW 2992 or BIBW 2669 (3, 30, and 300 nM) in vitro. Tumor volume and tumor growth delay (GD(V2)) were determined in tumors growing in NMRI (nu/nu) nude mice, treated with (a) BIBW 2992 (20 mg kg(-1) body weight orally), BIBW 2669 (3-4 mg kg(-1) body weight orally) or carrier until a final tumor diameter of 15 mm, or, (b) 3 days before a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation or, (c) after a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation until reaching the final tumor diameter., RESULTS: BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 significantly increased the doubling time of FaDu cells in vitro. A marked dose-dependent antiproliferative effect with blockade of the cells in G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle was found. Incubation with BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 for 3 days marginally increased radiosensitivity of FaDu cells in vitro. For BIBW 2992, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.006). Daily oral application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 in mice bearing unirradiated FaDu tumors showed a marked antiproliferative effect with a significant prolongation of tumor growth delay (p < 0.0001). After drug application for 3 days, followed by 20-Gy single-dose irradiation, a slight effect of both drugs on tumor growth delay was seen. For BIBW 2669, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.007). However, this effect disappeared when tumor volumes were normalized to the time point of irradiation suggesting that both drugs showed no or only a slight radiosensitizing effect in vivo. Daily application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 after a single-dose irradiation showed a clear inhibition of tumor growth with a significantly longer tumor growth delay after drug treatment compared to control tumors (p < 0.002). Enhancement ratios were smaller for irradiated than for unirradiated tumors, suggesting an additive effect for combinations with radiotherapy. In all treatment arms, the effects of BIBW 2669 were not significantly different from BIBW 2992., CONCLUSION: BIBW 2669 and BIBW 2992 showed a clear antiproliferative effect in vitro, whereas radiosensitization was only marginal. The present data are the first to show an effect of combined irradiation and dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition on tumor growth delay in vivo. Further preclinical investigations using fractionated irradiation schedules and local tumor control as experimental endpoint are needed to evaluate a possible curative potential for the combination treatment.",Excluded
3346,"The pattern and time course of somatosensory changes in the human UVB sunburn model reveal the presence of peripheral and central sensitization. The ultraviolet B (UVB) sunburn model was characterized with a comprehensive battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST). Primary hyperalgesia in UVB-irradiated skin and secondary hyperalgesia in adjacent nonirradiated skin were studied in 22 healthy subjects 24h after irradiation with UVB at 3-fold minimal erythema dose of a skin area 5 cm in diameter at the thigh and compared to mirror-image contralateral control areas. The time course of hyperalgesia over 96 h was studied in a subgroup of 12 subjects. Within the sunburn area, cold hyperesthesia (P=.01), profound generalized hyperalgesia to heat (P<.001), cold (P<.05), pinprick and pressure (P<.001), and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia (P<.001) were present. The finding of cold hyperalgesia and cold hyperesthesia is new in this model. The sunburn was surrounded by large areas of pinprick hyperalgesia (mean+/-SEM, 218+/-32 cm(2)) and a small rim of dynamic mechanical allodynia but no other sensory changes. Although of smaller magnitude, secondary hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia adjacent to the UVB-irradiated area were statistically highly significant. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia developed in parallel within hours, peaked after 24-32 h, and lasted for more than 96 h. These data reveal that the UVB sunburn model activates a broad spectrum of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms and hence is a useful human surrogate model to be used as a screening tool for target engagement in phases 1 and 2a of drug development.

1248,"Primary orbital meningioma: a study of six cases at a single institution. Primary orbital meningioma is a rare tumor of the anterior visual pathway and constitutes approximately 2% of all orbital tumors and 1-2% of all meningiomas. The differentiation from secondary orbital meningioma of intracranial origin is sometimes difficult on image. As the tumor often leads to visual loss if left untreated and surgical intervention inevitably causes morbidity, the timing and modality of treatment are very important. We carried out the study involving six cases (mean age: 42.7 years, male to female ratio: 1:5) of primary orbital meningioma to further elucidate its behavior. The clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis, treatment strategies, and follow-up information are recorded for all cases. The most frequent initial symptoms were visual complaints (100%) and proptosis (67%). In five cases, the diagnosis was based on pathologic findings and the tumors were all grade I meningiomas. In one case, however, the diagnosis was based on radiographic and clinical findings, lacking histologic confirmation. Five patients were operated on, four underwent tumor removal, and one received eyeball exenteration. One patient was treated with Novalis radiotherapy. The mean follow-up period was 8.8 years (range from 9 months to 15 years). All patients experienced loss of vision during the course without exception. No recurrent tumor was found in five cases during follow-up. In case 5, whose eyeball was exenterated, developed recurrent meningioma 7 years later. She received radiotherapy but the tumor was out of control. She expired 8 years after eyeball exenteration. The primary orbital meningioma is aggressive in behavior despite its benign histopathologic features. Loss of vision is frequently seen even after treatment. The tumor could be fatal if surgery and radiotherapy fail to control its intracranial extension.",Excluded
2807,"IN-VIVO RADIATION DOSIMETRY USING PORTABLE L BAND EPR: ON-SITE MEASUREMENT OF VOLUNTEERS IN FUKUSHIMA PREFECTURE, JAPAN. The aim of this study was to make direct measurements of the possible radiation-induced EPR signals in the teeth of volunteers who were residents in Fukushima within 80 km distance from the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant at the time of the disaster, and continued to live there for at least 3 month after the disaster. Thirty four volunteers were enrolled in this study. These measurements were made using a portable L-band EPR spectrometer, which was originally developed in the EPR Center at Dartmouth. All measurements were performed using surface loop resonators that have been specifically designed for the upper incisor teeth. Potentially these signals include not only radiation-induced signals induced by the incident but also background signals including those from prior radiation exposure from the environment and medical exposure. We demonstrated that it is feasible to transport the dosimeter to the measurement site and make valid measurements. The intensity of the signals that were obtained was not significantly above those seen in volunteers who had not had potential radiation exposures at Fukushima.Copyright © The Author 2016.

1514,"First in vivo head-to-head comparison of high-definition versus standard-definition stent imaging with 64-slice computed tomography. The aim of this study was to compare image quality characteristics from 64-slice high definition (HDCT) versus 64-slice standard definition CT (SDCT) for coronary stent imaging. In twenty-five stents of 14 patients, undergoing contrast-enhanced CCTA both on 64-slice SDCT (LightSpeedVCT, GE Healthcare) and HDCT (Discovery HD750, GE Healthcare), radiation dose, contrast, noise and stent characteristics were assessed. Two blinded observers graded stent image quality (score 1 = no, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe artefacts). All scans were reconstructed with increasing contributions of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %). Image quality was significantly superior in HDCT versus SDCT (score 1.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7; p < 0.05). Image noise was significantly higher in HDCT compared to SDCT irrespective of ASIR contributions (p < 0.05). Addition of 40 % ASIR or more reduced image noise significantly in both HDCT and SDCT. In HDCT in-stent luminal attenuation was significantly lower and mean measured in-stent luminal diameter was significantly larger (1.2 +/- 0.4 mm vs. 0.8 +/- 0.4 mm; p < 0.05) compared to SDCT. Radiation dose from HDCT was comparable to SDCT (1.8 +/- 0.7 mSv vs. 1.7 +/- 0.7 mSv; p = ns). Use of HDCT for coronary stent imaging reduces partial volume artefacts from stents yielding improved image quality versus SDCT at a comparable radiation dose.",Excluded

This study evaluated multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) scans performed on potential living donors for adult-to-adult liver transplantation (LDLT), with the aim of identifying significant findings that could be used to exclude potential transplantation donors. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 151 consecutive potential adult donors for LDLT from May 2007 to January 2015. Liver parenchyma steatosis, focal hepatic mass or intraabdominal malignancy, vascular variations, and donor liver volume were evaluated via MDCT. Grounds for excluding potential donors were also recorded and analyzed. Of the 151 potential donors, nine (6.0%) had moderate to severe fatty liver, 37 (24.5%) had hepatic arterial variants, 22 (14.6%) had significant portal venous variants, and more than half were found to have right accessory inferior hepatic vein. No intraabdominal malignancies were found. Eighty-eight potential donors were rejected, with the most common cause being insufficient recipient volume or remnant donor volume (47.7%), moderate to severe parenchymal steatosis (10.2%), and recipient expiration prior to transplantation (8.0%). An additional 16 potential donors were excluded by the surgical team due to the complexity of their portal venous variations. The rate of exclusion by pre-transplant imaging evaluation with MDCT was 33.8%. MDCT can provide accurate quantification of donor liver volume and steatosis severity along with precise demonstration of vascular variants, which are crucial for the preoperative evaluation of LDLT. However, MDCT may be ineffective for evaluating the biliary system without hepatobiliary-excreted contrast agent and has the disadvantage of ionizing radiation.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
2381,"[Prospective double-blind study of prophylaxis of radioxerostomia with Coumarin/Troxerutine in patients with head and neck cancer]. AIM: Prospective, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to prove the efficacy of Coumarin/Troxerutine (Venalot Depot) for protection of salivary glands during a head and neck irradiation., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Forty-eight radiotherapy patients (60 Gy) with head and neck cancer were included in this trial. During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method. Sialometry seems not suitable for the assessment of early radiation effects.",Excluded
3458,"The influence of radiotherapy techniques on the plan quality and on the risk of secondary tumors in patients with pituitary adenoma. Background: This planning study compares different radiotherapy techniques for patients with pituitary adenoma, including flatness filter free mode (FFF), concerning plan quality and secondary malignancies for potentially young patients. The flatness filter has been described as main source of photon scatter. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven patients with pituitary adenoma were included. An Elekta SynergyTM linac was used in the treatment planning system Oncentra and for the measurements. 3D plans, IMRT, and VMAT plans and non-coplanar varieties were considered. The plan quality was evaluated regarding homogeneity, conformity, delivery time and dose to the organs at risk. The secondary malignancy risk was calculated from dose volume data and from measured dose to the periphery using different models for carcinoma and sarcoma risk. Result(s): The homogeneity and conformity were nearly unchanged with and without flattening filter, neither was the delivery time found substantively different. VMAT plans were more homogenous, conformal and faster in delivery than IMRT plans. The secondary cancer risk was reduced with FFF both in the treated region and in the periphery. VMAT plans resulted in a higher secondary brain cancer risk than IMRT plans, but the risk for secondary peripheral cancer was reduced. Secondary sarcoma risk plays a minor role. No advantage was found for non-coplanar techniques. The FFF delivery times were not shortened due to additional monitor units needed and technical limitations. The risk for secondary brain cancer seems to depend on the irradiated volume. Secondary sarcoma risk is much smaller than carcinoma risk in accordance to the results of the atomic bomb survivors. The reduction of the peripheral dose and resulting secondary malignancy risk for FFF is statistically significant. However, it is negligible in comparison to the risk in the treated region. Conclusion(s): Treatments with FFF can reduce secondary malignancy risk while retaining similar quality as with flattening filter and should be preferred. VMAT plans show the best plan quality combined with lowest peripheral secondary malignancy risk, but highest level of second brain cancer risk. Taking this into account VMAT FFF seems the most advantageous technique for the treatment of pituitary adenomas with the given equipment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
2632,"Biologic dosimetry in thyroid cancer patients after repeated treatments with iodine-131. UNLABELLED: To estimate a cumulative dosimetric index that reflects the dose to the circulating lymphocytes after repeated treatments with 131I, biologic dosimetry was applied to 18 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma and neck relapse or lung metastases., METHODS: Chromosomal aberrations were scored in peripheral blood samples that were obtained before and 4 days after each administration of 3.7 GBq 131I according to two methods, conventional cytogenetics and chromosome 4 painting., RESULTS: The mean dosimetric index was equal to 0.5 Gy by both methods after the administration of 3.7 GBq 131I. Repeated administrations of 131I delivered the same dose each time, resulting in a cumulative dose from 1-3.5 Gy in the patients who had two to seven treatments. However, the estimated dose, based on the number of chromosomal aberrations on Day 4 and, above all, from the third treatment on, was considerably lower than the real dose absorbed by the lymphocytes. This may be linked to the phenomenon of apoptosis, which results in a loss of information during the course of repeated irradiation., CONCLUSION: Both chromosomal painting and conventional cytogenetics underestimate the cumulative dose after repeated 131I treatments. A complementary test measuring apoptosis may improve the dose estimates.",Excluded
1490,"Ultraviolet-B induces ERCC6 repression in lens epithelium cells of age-related nuclear cataract through coordinated DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation. Background: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. Result(s): mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded

The volume of each thyroid lobe of 32 hyperthyroid cats was determined by ultrasound and scintigraphy. The ultrasonographically determined volume (ellipsoid formula) for each thyroid lobe was compared with the scintigraphic volume that was calculated using eight different formulas: F1 [(pi/6) x L x H x W], F2 [(pi /2) x L x W(2)], F3 [0.33 x (area cm(2))(3/2)], F4 [1.08 x (pi /6) x L x W(2)], F5 (area x H), F6 (0.27 x area x L), F7 (pi x L x W(2)) and F8 [pi x (4/3) x W(3)]. F1, F3, F4 and F6 did not differ statistically from the volumes measured on ultrasound, while F2, F5, F7 and F8 did.

PURPOSE: This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated thoracic radiotherapy concurrently combined with daily carboplatin in patients with locally advanced, unresectable nonsmall cell lung cancer., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty-one patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer were treated with continuous course, twice daily thoracic radiotherapy (1.5 Gy each) to a total of 60 Gy over 4 weeks. Carboplatin (25 mg/m2) i.v. was given immediately before each morning thoracic radiotherapy. Blood samples were taken to measure the blood free platinum pharmacokinetics on day 1., RESULTS: All 31 patients completed the protocol treatment without delay. The median age was 73 years, and the majority had Stage IIIA (32%) or IIIB (48%) disease. Major acute toxicity (> or = Grade 3) included 17 patients (55%) with leukopenia, 5 patients (16%) with thrombocytopenia, and 7 patients (23%) with esophagitis. One possible treatment-related death due to diffuse pneumonitis was observed. There were three complete responses (CRs) and 23 partial responses (PRs) in the radiation field, for a response rate of 84%. The relapse pattern was predominantly loco-regional, and the median survival time was 9.8 months. The area under the plasma level-time curve (AUC) of free platinum correlated significantly (r = -0.41, p = 0.04) with the surviving fraction of leukocytes, but not with the severity of the esophagitis. Responders had significantly (p = 0.04 by Welch's t-test) higher AUCs than nonresponders., CONCLUSIONS: This combination therapy was feasible and efficacious against locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer.

10,"Post-Fukushima radiation education for Japanese high school students in affected areas and its positive effects on their radiation literacy. In post-Fukushima Japan, radiation education is very important, and the subject is being actively discussed. However, little information is available about the amount of knowledge students initially had about radiation or about how well radiation education improves their understanding. Using the questionnaire results of 717 students completed before and after radiation lectures held in three high schools in Fukushima, we examined the number of answers to the questionnaire aligned with the evidence base, and classified the students into clusters based on radiation-related behavior and attitudes to assess the effectiveness of the lecture. The contents of the lectures consisted of (i) scientific knowledge relating to radiation, (ii) results of radiation examinations conducted locally following the disaster and (iii) measures and precautions for daily radiation protection. Associations between the type of knowledge and radiation-related behavior and attitude were also examined to determine which type of knowledge was more important for deepening students' understanding of radiation. This study revealed that radiation education in high schools was effective for students with respect to acquiring relevant basic and practical knowledge; however, the effects of the radiation lecture differed greatly between schools, presumably due to differences in the delivery and atmosphere of the lecture. The present study also suggested that radiation education may positively transform student attitudes and behaviors related to radiation. To enable such a change in awareness, the acquisition of scientific knowledge is essential, for it enables individuals to make better decisions about important matters in their daily lives.",Excluded
767,"Towards the control of chikungunya vector in la Reunion using the sterile insect technique: Sexual competitiveness and mating success of sterilized males Aedes albopictus. The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used as part of area-wide integrated pest management programs for insects such as fruit fies, screw-worm fies and tsetse fies. It is based on the releases of large numbers of sterile males, which transfer their sterile sperm to wild females for the fertilization of the eggs, resulting in embryonic death. The lack of offspring could then lead to a decrease of the wild population density. The SIT is currently being developed at the FAO/IAEA in Vienna and on La Reunion, France, for the potential control of Aedes albopictus, vector of Chikungunya and secondary vector of Dengue viruses. In this context, we investigated the impact of the sterilisation process on male mating success and sexual competitiveness in the laboratory and under semi-feld conditions. Males from a young laboratory colony (F4) were irradiated as pupae (>20h old) with gamma-rays at 35 or 40 Gy. In the laboratory, the time for male sexual maturation was not affected by the irradiation, neither was the insemination rate of 4 days old males as compared to un-irradiated ones. The daily individual mating success of sterile males during 15 days was reduced as compared to un-irradiated males; however the differences were signifcant only during the second week. Sterility was maintained over successive matings and after a resting period. Under semi-feld conditions, sterile males competed well against wild males, though a resting period of 5 days in the laboratory before release greatly improved their effciency. A ratio of fve sterile to one wild male resulted in a two-fold reduction of the wild females' mean fertility. Valuable information on the effects of the sterilization process was collected and it is suggested that an effcient reduction of a wild population might be achieved by releasing sterile males as adults. Moreover, the results indicate that a resting period allows a recovery from radiation-induced somatic damages which improved the biological quality of the males.",Excluded
1641,"Single-fraction radiotherapy versus multifraction radiotherapy for palliation of painful vertebral bone metastases - Equivalent efficacy, less toxicity, more convenient: A subset analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 97-14. Background: The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 97-14 revealed no difference between radiation delivered for painful bone metastases at a dose of 8 gray (Gy) in 1 fraction (single-fraction radiotherapy [SFRT]) and 30 Gy in 10 fractions (multifraction radiotherapy [MFRT]) in pain relief or narcotic use 3 months after randomization. SFRT for painful vertebral bone metastases (PVBM) has not been well accepted, possibly because of concerns about efficacy and toxicity. In the current study, the authors evaluated the subset of patients that was treated specifically for patients with PVBM. METHOD(S): PVBM included the cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar spine regions. Among patients with PVBM, differences in retreatment rates and in pain relief, narcotic use, and toxicity 3 months after randomization were evaluated. RESULT(S): Of 909 eligible patients, 235 (26%) had PVBM. Patients with and without PVBM differed in terms of the percentage of men (55% vs 47%, respectively; P =.03) and the proportion of patients with multiple painful sites (57% vs 38%, respectively; P <.01). Among those with PVBM, more patients who received MFRT had multiple sites treated (65% vs 49% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P =.02). There were no statistically significant treatment differences in terms of pain relief (62% vs 70% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P =.59) or freedom from narcotic use (24% vs 27%, respectively; P =.76) at 3 months. Significant differences in acute grade 2 through 4 toxicity (20% vs 10% for MFRT vs SFRT, respectively; P =.01) and acute grade 2 through 4 gastrointestinal toxicity (14% vs 6%, respectively; P =.01) were observed at 3 months, with lower toxicities seen in the patients treated with SFRT. Late toxicity was rare. No myelopathy was recorded. SFRT produced higher 3-year retreatment rates (5% vs 15%; P =.01). CONCLUSION(S): Results for the subset of patients with PVBM in the RTOG 94-17 randomized controlled trial were comparable to those for the entire population. SFRT produced less acute toxicity and a higher rate of retreatment than MFRT. SFRT and MFRT resulted in comparable pain relief and narcotic use at 3 months. © 2012 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2085,"Early clinical outcomes for 3 radiation techniques for brain metastases: Focal versus whole-brain. Purpose: To present our novel technique for brain metastases (low-dose whole brain radiation therapy [WBRT] with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) and focal, frameless stereotactic intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]) in the context of patterns of failure, dosimetry, acute toxicity, and overall survival for 3 different radiation techniques. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 92 patients undergoing radiation for brain metastases via the following: (1) ""prophylactic"" WBRT to a low dose (median 30 Gy) with an SIB to the gross tumor volume plus 2-3 mm margin (median dose 45 Gy) in 10-15 fractions; (2) focal, frameless image-guided stereotactic IMRT (S-IMRT) in 5 fractions to tumor only (median 30 Gy); or (3) conventional (c)WBRT using 2 lateral opposed beams in 10-15 fractions (30-37.5 Gy). The primary endpoints were local (LBC), distant (DBC), and total brain control (TBC) for each of the 3 types of brain radiation. Survival, toxicity, and dosimetry were reported as secondary endpoints. Result(s): LBC was achieved in 72%, 78%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. DBC (ie, no new brain metastases) was observed in 92%, 67%, and 81% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. TBC (LBC + DBC) was 72%, 67%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. No statistical difference in overall survival was observed (P = .067), and only 1 patient experienced biopsy proven radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): TBC after low-dose WBRT with SIB was acceptable and at least comparable to S-IMRT and cWBRT. SIB seems to be a safe and effective treatment strategy for patients with brain metastases and may efficiently combine the benefits of cWBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
880,"Comparison between percutaneous and traditional fixation of lumbar spine fracture: Intraoperative radiation exposure levels and outcomes. Objective: To compare radiation exposure doses and clinical and radiological outcomes between percutaneous pedicular screwing (closed reduction internal fixation [CRIF]) and classical open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) in lumbar spine fracture without neurologic deficit. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty patients (mean age, 42.5. years) were divided into two treatment groups: (Percutaneous) CRIF versus (traditional) ORIF. Screw position and anatomic vertebral reconstruction were checked on routine control X-ray and postoperative CT scan. Study parameters comprised: surgery time, radiation exposure time, radiation dose level for X-ray (DAP) and for CT (DLP),blood loss, length of hospital stay and postoperative pain (VAS). Result(s): At a mean 25.5. months' follow-up, there were no significant inter-group differences on the epidemiological parameters: age, gender, fracture level, fracture type on the Magerl classification, preoperative local vertebral kyphosis angle, or fracture-to-surgery interval. Effective radiation dose was 3-fold higher in CRIF than in ORIF, but 6-fold lower than for the postoperative CT scan. Postoperative pain on VAS was significantly lower after CRIF, allowing earlier gait resumption and return to work and daily activity. There were no significant differences in length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, screw malpositioning or postoperative or end-of-follow-up kyphosis angle. Conclusion(s): Percutaneous surgery provided clinical and radiological outcomes strictly comparable to those of open surgery, but with a higher effective radiation exposure dose, including for the medical team and especially for the surgeon. This higher exposure dose, however, is to be relativized by comparison to that of the postoperative CT scan, which involved a much higher exposure dose for the patient. Level of Evidence: Level IV.

1902,"X-ray induced sex-chromosome loss, when ring-X chromosome males are irradiated and mated to females carrying mei-9, mei-41 or mei-218. Radiation damage induced in the sperm nucleus is repaired after this nucleus has entered the oocyte. The yield of induced genetic damage is known to be dependent on maternal genotype and can also be modified by treatment of the females with metabolic inhibitors. The experiments reported here were designed to find out whether a more specific analysis of the interaction between male gamete and oocyte cytoplasm can be carried out using mutants that are known to affect repair processes. Males carrying ring-X chromosomes were exposed to X-ray doses up to 1000 R and mated to females homozygous for a repair-deficient mutant. The mutants used were mei-9a, mei-9L1, mei-41A10, and mei-41D5. In addition a yellow (y) X chromosome was used as a control and an attempt was made to obtain data using mei-21815, a mutant at a locus not thought to affect repair. With mei-9 mutants there is an enhancement of the spontaneous and induced rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss. The mei-41 mutants did not affect the rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss. Mei-218 females were difficult to work with because they gave very few progeny. From these data it can be argued that repair-deficient mutants will indeed be useful for an analysis of the fixation of radiation-induced genetic damage.",Excluded

3233,"Radiofrequency ablation is beneficial in simultaneous treatment of synchronous liver metastases and primary colorectal cancer. Background: In patients with resectable synchronous colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), either twostaged or simultaneous resections of the primary tumor and liver metastases are performed. Data on radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for the treatment of CRLM during a simultaneous procedure is lacking. The primary aim was to analyze short-term and long-term outcome of RFA in simultaneous treatment. A secondary aim was to compare simultaneous resection with the colorectal-first approach. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 241 patients with colorectal cancer and synchronous CRLM between 2000-2016. Median follow-up was 36.1 months (IQR 18.2-58.8 months). A multivariable analysis was performed to analyze the postoperative morbidity, using the comprehensive complication index. A propensity matched analysis was performed to compare survival rates. Result(s): In multivariable analysis, the best predictor of lower complication severity was treatment with RFA (p = 0.040). Higher complication rates were encountered in patients who underwent an abdominoperineal resection (p = 0.027) or age > 60 years (p = 0.022). The matched analysis showed comparable overall survival in RFA treated patients versus patients undergoing a liver resection with a five year overall survival of 39.4% and 37.5%, respectively (p = 0.782). In a second matched analysis, 5-year overall survival rates in simultaneously treated patients (43.8%) was comparable to patients undergoing the colorectal first approach (43.0%, p = 0.223). Conclusion(s): RFA treatment of CRLM in simultaneous procedures is associated with a lower complication severity and non-inferior oncological outcome as compared to partial liver resection. RFA should be considered a useful alternative to liver resection.Copyright © 2018 Hof et al.

3037,"Dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy. PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a prime candidate for image-guided radiotherapy. This study was designed to assess the feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy by quantifying the dosimetric effects induced by the magnetic field in patients' plans and identifying the associated clinical consequences., METHODS: Monte Carlo dose calculation was performed for nine patients of various treatment sites (lung, liver, prostate, brain, skull-base, and spine) and tissue homogeneities, in the presence of 0.5 and 1.5 T magnetic fields. Dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters such as D95, D5, and V20 as well as equivalent uniform dose were compared for the target and organs at risk, before and after applying the magnetic field. The authors further assessed whether the plans affected by clinically relevant dose distortions could be corrected independent of the planning system., RESULTS: By comparing the resulting dose distributions and analyzing the respective DVHs, it was determined that despite the observed lateral beam deflection, for magnetic fields of up to 0.5 T, neither was the target coverage jeopardized nor was the dose to the nearby organs increased in all cases except for prostate. However, for a 1.5 T magnetic field, the dose distortions were more pronounced and of clinical concern in all cases except for spine. In such circumstances, the target was severely underdosed, as indicated by a decrease in D95 of up to 41% of the prescribed dose compared to the nominal situation (no magnetic field). Sites such as liver and spine were less affected due to higher tissue homogeneity, typically smaller beam range, and the choice of beam directions. Simulations revealed that small modifications to certain plan parameters such as beam isocenter (up to 19 mm) and gantry angle (up to 10degree) are sufficient to compensate for the magnetic field-induced dose disturbances. The authors' observations indicate that the degree of required corrections strongly depends on the beam range and direction relative to the magnetic field. This method was also applicable to more heterogeneous scenarios such as skull-base tumors., CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the dosimetric feasibility of real-time MRI-guided proton therapy and delivering a clinically acceptable dose to patients with various tumor locations within magnetic fields of up to 1.5 T. This work could serve as a guide and encouragement for further efforts toward clinical implementation of hybrid MRI-proton gantry systems.",Excluded
2719,"The patient's experience of defaecating proctography: Comparing magnetic resonance with conventional fluoroscopy techniques. Introduction: Fluoroscopy and MRI are currently used to investigate defaecation and pelvic floor dysfunction, with advantages and disadvantages to both modalities. Anecdotally it is suspected that MRI, allowing more privacy, may be better tolerated by patients but that symptoms may be more easily replicated with fluoroscopic technique due to the physiological position. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient experience of both techniques to potentially help guide the choice of defaecating proctography modality in the future. Method(s): This prospective study was conducted June 2015-March 2017 in a large teaching hospital. Patients undergoing fluoroscopy (FDP) or MR defaecating proctography (MRDP) completed a post-procedure questionnaire rating their satisfaction (1-5, 5 being most satisfied) of different aspects of the test. Result(s): 24 patients underwent FDP and 17 MRDP. Both procedures were scored highly in general for all questions with mean >4.1 and median 5, out of 5. Though not statistically significant, the mean scores for all aspects of the test were slightly higher for fluoroscopy than MR. As well as scoring higher for comfort (4.8 vs 4.4) and dignity maintained (4.6 vs 4.1), the patients who underwent fluoroscopy thought it was easier to replicate symptoms than the patient who underwent MR defaecating proctography (4.6 vs 4.2). Conclusion(s): This study shows that both FDP and MRDP are well tolerated in the investigation of defaecation and pelvic floor dysfunction. FDP was scored consistently higher than MRDP, but this was not statistically significant. Thus, this study suggests that patient tolerance of the test is unlikely to be any worse for FDP than for MRDP. Clinicians and radiologists should take into account risks of radiation exposure as well as potential for surgical management when making their decision as to which test is appropriate. The authors recommend that if the patient is unable to replicate their symptoms in MRDP, fluoroscopy should be performed to ensure significant pathology is not being missed.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
1620,"Salvage radiotherapy in patients affected by oligorecurrent pelvic nodal prostate cancer. Purpose: Metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) is an investigational treatment option in patients with oligorecurrent prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this retrospective study is to report oncologic outcome and toxicity of elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) in PCa patients affected by pelvic nodal oligorecurrence. Method(s): 41 consecutive patients were treated with salvage radiotherapy. At biochemical recurrence after primary treatment, oligorecurrent disease was detected by positron emission tomography (PET) in 94% of the patients. Image-guided intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was delivered using tomotherapy. 83% of the patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with ENRT. Survival analysis was performed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test was used to analyze associations between survival end-points and clinical parameters. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. Toxicity was registered according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Result(s): The median at follow-up was 33.6 months. At 3 years, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS) were 89%, 92%, and 53%, respectively. At univariate analysis, all survival end-points were correlated with the number of positive pelvic lymph nodes at oligorecurrence (<= 3 vs > 3). Biochemical-PFS was correlated with PSA (p = 0.034) and PSA doubling time (p = 0.004) at oligorecurrence. At multivariate analysis, no independent variable was statistically significant. No patient experienced grade >= 2 late toxicity after radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): The number of metastatic lymph nodes and PSA doubling time seems to be important prognostic factors in the pelvic oligorecurrent setting. Salvage radiotherapy combined with short-course ADT might be a valid treatment strategy.Copyright © 2020, Federacion de Sociedades Espanolas de Oncologia (FESEO).",Excluded
475,"Influence of Needle Position on Lumbar Segmental Nerve Root Block Selectivity. Background and Objectives: In patients with chronic low back pain radiating to the leg, segmental nerve root blocks (SNRBs) are performed to predict surgical outcome and identify the putative symptomatic spinal nerve. Epidural spread may lead to false interpretation, affecting clinical decision making. Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Method(s): Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Result(s): Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). Conclusion(s): The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy. © 2006 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",Excluded
1376,"The prognostic role of hemoglobin levels in patients undergoing concurrent chemo-radiation for anal cancer. Background: Concurrent chemo-radiation (CT-RT) is a standard therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of anal canal. Different clinical and biological factors may potentially affect outcome. We investigated the prognostic role of baseline hemoglobin (Hb) in a cohort of anal cancer patients submitted to CT-RT with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. Method(s): Up to 161 patients with clinical stage T1-T4/N0-N3/M0 were treated. Response was assessed at 6 weeks and thereafter at 3, 6 and 12 months. Two different approaches were used:a)simultaneous integrated boost following RTOG 05-29 indications;b)first sequence of 45Gy/25 fractions to the pelvis followed by 9-14.4 Gy/5-8 fractions to the macroscopic disease. Primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): On multivariate analysis, pre-treatment Hb level had a significant correlation to OS (HR:0.53;95% CI:0.33-0.87; p = 0.001), but not to PFS (HR:0.78;95% CI:0.53-1.15; p = 0.12) Patients with pre-treatment Hb >= 12 g/dl had 5-year PFS and OS of 82.2%, compared to 29.3% and 32.8% for those below the threshold. The likelihood to achieve a complete remission increased by 5.6% for every single-unit (g/dl) increase in baseline Hb level over 11 g/dl. On multivariate analysis, response to treatment had a significant correlation to PFS (incomplete vs complete response - HR:5.43;95% CI:2.75-10.7; p < 0.0001) and OS (HR: 6.96;95% CI:2.96-16.5; p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): We showed that baseline Hb level is a strong indicator for poor response to RT-CT in anal cancer patients. A close clinical monitoring for incomplete response to treatment should be advised in patients with low pre-treatment Hb. The hypothesis that the preservation of adequate Hb level during treatment may lead to a better outcome needs prospective evaluation.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded
40,"Retreatment of vestibular schwannomas with Gamma Knife surgery. OBJECT: The response rate of vestibular schwannomas (VSs) to radiosurgery has reached the 97% level in several published series. When failure rarely occurs, some controversy has existed as to whether the tumor has to be resected or can be safely retreated with radiosurgery. The authors retrospectively studied the outcome of retreating 11 patients with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS)., METHODS: The authors studied 11 patients at the New England Gamma Knife Center who had undergone GKS as a second radiosurgical treatment for VS from 1994 to 2007. One patient underwent proton-beam radiotherapy as the first treatment, and the other 10 patients had undergone GKS initially. Tumor control (size before and after the first and the second treatment) was evaluated using MR imaging to demonstrate the course after the 2 treatments. Facial nerve function (House-Brackmann grading system), trigeminal nerve function, hearing (Gardner-Robertson classification), and any adverse radiation effects were evaluated. The prescription dose was 12 Gy (11-13.2 Gy) for both treatments., RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, 2 showed increase, 1 had no change, and, in 8, the VS decreased in size after the retreatment. One tumor remained unchanged over the first 6 months, but demonstrated signs of internal necrosis. All patients demonstrated stable facial nerve function. Regarding facial numbness, 2 patients experienced increases, 8 no change, and 1 decreased numbness. There was no functional hearing prior to the second treatment in 10 patients, and hearing was impaired in 1 patient. Adverse radiation effects (slight peduncular edema) were seen in 2 patients after the second treatment, and 1 patient had edema after the first treatment as well., CONCLUSIONS: Vestibular schwannomas can be retreated with GKS with good tumor control response and low risk of toxicity.",Excluded

Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a flowable hemostatic matrix, and their effects for postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after pancreatectomy. Method(s): This was a randomized, clinical, single-center, single-blind (participant), non-inferiority, phase IV, and parallel-group trial. The primary endpoint was the incidence of POPF. The secondary endpoints were risk factors for POPF, drain removal days, incidence of complication, 90-day mortality, and length of hospital stay. Result(s): This study evaluated a total of 53 patients, of whom 26 patients were in the intervention group (flowable hemostatic matrix) and 27 patients were in the control group (thrombin-coated collagen patch). POPF was more common in the control group than in the intervention group (59.3% vs. 30.8%, p = 0.037). Among participants who underwent distal pancreatectomy, POPF (33.3% vs. 92.3%, p = 0.004), and clinically relevant POPF (8.3% vs. 46.2%, p = 0.027) was more common in the control group. A multivariate logistic regression model identified flowable hemostatic matrix use as an independent negative risk factor for POPF, especially in cases of distal pancreatectomy (DP) (odds ratio 17.379, 95% confidential interval 1.453-207.870, p = 0.024). Conclusion(s): Flowable hemostatic matrix application is a simple, feasible, and effective method of preventing POPF after pancreatectomy, especially for patients with DP. Non-inferiority was demonstrated in the efficacy of preventing POPF in the intervention group compared to the control group.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

Purpose(s): To evaluate staff radiation exposure during PCP and the effect of adjunctive protective drapes on dose reduction. Method(s): The RADIANT study (NCT01974453) is a prospective, observational study evaluating operator radiation exposure during PCP using electronic dosimeter. In a sub-group of procedures all the staff members (II operator, nurse circulator and technologist) were also equipped with a dedicated electronic dosimeter. Result(s): From a total of 2028 procedures included in the RADIANT study, staff members' doses were available for 122 procedures (67 coronarography and 55 percutaneous coronary interventions). Median fluoroscopy time was 306 s (Interquartile range 155-526 s) and the dose area product (DAP) was 18.0 Gy*cm2 (10-35.5 Gy*cm2). The radiation exposure was highest for the operating physician (6.7 muSv) and progressively lower for the nurse circulator (1.8 muSv), the II operator (1 muSv) and the technologist (0.7 muSv, p < 0.001).

2592,"Developmental defects and male sterility in mice lacking the ubiquitin-like DNA repair gene mHR23B. mHR23B encodes one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23, a ubiquitin-like fusion protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Part of mHR23B is complexed with the XPC protein, and this heterodimer functions as the main damage detector and initiator of global genome NER. While XPC defects exist in humans and mice, mutations for mHR23A and mHR23B are not known. Here, we present a mouse model for mHR23B. Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.",Excluded

2154,"Intrinsic Functional Boundaries of Lateral Frontal Cortex in the Common Marmoset Monkey. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small New World primate species that has been recently targeted as a potentially powerful preclinical model of human prefrontal cortex dysfunction. Although the structural boundaries of frontal cortex were described in marmosets at the start of the 20th century (Brodmann, 1909) and refined more recently (Paxinos et al., 2012), the broad functional boundaries of marmoset frontal cortex have yet to be established. In this study, we sought to functionally derive boundaries of the marmoset lateral frontal cortex (LFC) using ultra-high field (9.4 T) resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). We collected RS-fMRI data in seven (four females, three males) lightly anesthetized marmosets and used a data-driven hierarchical clustering approach to derive subdivisions of the LFC based on intrinsic functional connectivity. We then conducted seed-based analyses to assess the functional connectivity between these clusters and the rest of the brain. The results demonstrated seven distinct functional clusters within the LFC. The functional connectivity patterns of these clusters with the rest of the brain were also found to be distinct and organized along a rostrocaudal gradient, consonant with those found in humans and macaques. Overall, these results support the view that marmosets are a promising preclinical modeling species for studying LFC dysfunction related to neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative human brain diseases. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The common marmoset is a New World primate that has garnered recent attention as a powerful complement to canonical Old World primate (e.g., macaques) and rodent models (e.g., rats, mice) for preclinical modeling of the human brain in healthy and diseased states. A critical step in the development of marmosets for such models is to characterize functional network topologies of frontal cortex in healthy, normally functioning marmosets, that is, how these circuitries are functionally divided and how those topologies compare to human circuitry. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate functional boundaries of the lateral frontal cortex and the corresponding network topologies in marmoset monkeys.

Background/Aim: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has side-effects that adversely affect patients' quality of life. The aim of this study was to identify serum metabolite biomarkers that might be used to predict the side-effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Patients and Methods: Metabolomic analysis of serum samples from 26 patients with ESCC that were collected before neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was performed. The metabolites associated with hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity were evaluated. Result(s): Serum levels of glutaric acid, glucuronic acid, and cystine were significantly higher in hematological toxicity, and phosphatidylcholines and phosphatidylethanolamines exhibited a tendency to be higher in those with hematological toxicity. The serum level of pyruvic acid was significantly lower in nephrotoxicity, and lysophosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines tended to be lower in those with nephrotoxicity. Conclusion(s): Our study found that serum levels of some metabolites differed significantly between patients with and without hematological or renal side-effects. These metabolites may be useful biomarkers for predicting hematological toxicity or nephrotoxicity after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for ESCC.Copyright © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

PURPOSE: To compare combined three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography with x-ray angiography for planning treatment of peripheral vascular disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three radiologists retrospectively reviewed the pretreatment x-ray angiographic and MR angiographic studies obtained in 30 consecutive patients: 15 patients (15 limbs) evaluated for limb salvage and 15 patients (20 limbs) evaluated because of claudication. MR angiography included acquisition of 2D contrast-enhanced MR digital subtraction angiograms of the area from the adductor canal to the feet and 3D spoiled gradient-recalled-echo bolus chase MR angiograms obtained in three stations from the aorta to the middle portion of the calf. Each reader reviewed the x-ray and MR angiograms to determine the inflow and outflow segments for a hypothetical bypass graft placement. RESULT(S): The three readers selected identical segments for inflow at MR angiography and x-ray angiography in 32, 32, and 35 of the 35 limbs evaluated (mean percentages of agreement [95% Cl]: 91% [77%, 98%], 91% [77%, 98%], and 95% [90%, 100%], respectively).

816,"Adjuvant Radiation and Chemoradiation for High-Risk Salivary Gland Malignancies: A 20-Year Single Institution Experience. Purpose/Objective(s): To report our institutional outcomes of patients with non-previously treated, high-risk salivary gland malignancies treated with surgery followed by adjuvant radiation (RT) and chemoradiation (CRT). Materials/Methods: From January 1997 to December 2017, 108 patients were treated with surgery, and adjuvant RT (n = 50) or CRT (n = 58) for high-risk pathologic features: perineural involvement (PNI), lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), positive/close (<2mm) margin, high grade, extracapsular extension (ECE), or positive lymph nodes. Adjuvant RT was delivered in 2 Gy daily fractions, and adjuvant CRT was delivered for 4-6 alternating week cycles: the most common regimen, TFHX, consisted of 5 days paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 on d1), infusional 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d x 5d), hydroxyurea (500 mg PO BID), and 1.5 Gy twice daily irradiation followed by a 9-day break without treatment. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate rates of locoregional control (LRC), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with LRC, DFS, and OS. Multivariable Cox Regression (MVA) was performed for known confounding risk factors, and factors associated with a trend to significance (p <0.20). Chi-Square was used to compare rates of toxicities between groups. Result(s): Median follow-up was 52 months (range: 3 - 226). The most common histologies included: Adenoid Cystic (n = 30), Mucoepidermoid (n = 20), and Salivary Duct Adenocarcinoma (n = 18). The most common location included the parotid (n = 73). The median RT dose was 66 Gy (range 43.2 - 74 Gy). The 5-year LRC was 88%, 5-year DFS was 57%, and 5-year OS was 78%. On MVA, LRC was not associated with any factors; DFS was associated with the size of the tumor (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), tumor location (HR 2.0, p = 0.01), and stage (HR 1.7, p = 0.02); and OS was associated with N stage (HR 2.3, p = 0.005), LVSI (HR 1.9, p = 0.012), ECE (HR 1.5, p = 0.032), and stage (HR 1.3, p = 0.05). CRT was not associated with improved LRC (HR 0.5, p = 0.34), DFS (HR 0.4, p = 0.44), or OS (HR: 0.46, p = 0.384). Since 87% of node positive patients were treated with adjuvant CRT compared to 13% with RT, therefore comparison was not possible. There was no difference in any acute or late grade 3+ toxicities, or parenteral nutrition between RT and CRT (p = 0.98, p = 0.85, and p = 0.83), respectively. There was one acute grade 5 toxicity in the RT group. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is the largest single institution cohort of adjuvant CRT for high-risk salivary malignancies. Overall, adjuvant CRT doesn't enhance outcomes compared to adjuvant RT alone. However, LRC was similar between RT and CRT groups in spite of more adverse features (nodal disease and ECE) in the CRT group. Distant metastatic disease remains a significant pattern of failure. We await large prospective evidence to determine which subsets of patients benefit from adjuvant CRT.Copyright © 2019",Excluded

Result(s): Median doses decreased by 74.8% (P <.001), from 13.1 millisieverts (mSv) (interquartile range 9.3-14.7) in period 1 to 3.3 mSv (1.8-6.7) in period 4. Factors associated with greatest dose reductions (P <.001) were all most frequently applied in period 4: axial-sequential acquisition (univariate: -8.0 mSv [-9.7 to -7.9]), high-pitch helical acquisition (univariate: -8.8 mSv [-9.3 to -7.9]), reduced tube voltage (100 vs 120 kV) (univariate: -6.4 mSv [-7.4 to -5.4]), and use of automatic exposure control (univariate: -5.3 mSv [-6.2 to -4.4]). Conclusion(s): CCTA radiation doses were reduced 74.8% through increasing use of dose-saving measures and evolving scanner technology. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1547,"Carotid Dosimetry and the Risk of Carotid Blowout Syndrome After Reirradiation With Head and Neck Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy. PURPOSE: To correlate carotid dose and risk of carotid blowout syndrome (CBOS) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), hypothesizing that carotid dose does not correlate with CBOS., METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively reviewed 186 patients with recurrent, previously irradiated head and neck cancer treated between January 2008 and March 2013. Patients treated early in our experience with incomplete dosimetry were excluded from analysis (n = 111). A total of 75 patients were identified, providing 150 carotid arteries for analysis. Median follow-up was 8 months (range, 1-91 months) for all patients, and 37 months for surviving patients (range, 31-91 months). Patients were treated with linear accelerator-based SBRT to a median dose up to 44 Gy (range, 40-50 Gy) in 5 fractions delivered on a twice-weekly basis. Concurrent cetuximab was used in 63 patients (84%). The bilateral common, internal, and external carotid arteries were delineated 2 cm above and below the planning target volume. The maximum dose to 0.1 cm3 (D0.1cc), 1 cm3 (D1cc), and 2 cm3 (D2cc) of the carotid and the mean carotid dose from SBRT were recorded and analyzed for association with carotid bleeding events, using binary logistic regression., RESULTS: Median reirradiation interval was 20 months (range, 3-423 months), and median prior radiation dose was 70 Gy (range, 52.5-140 Gy). Sixteen patients (21.3%) received more than 1 course of SBRT, and the cumulative carotid doses from fused summary plans were recorded. The overall median D0.1cc, D1cc, D2cc, and mean carotid doses were 40.8 Gy (interquartile range [IQR], 21.6-47.6 Gy), 26.8 Gy (IQR, 14.1-42.1 Gy), 15.4 Gy (IQR, 8.4-32.7 Gy), and 15.0 Gy (IQR, 8.9-23.3 Gy), respectively. There were a total of 4 bleeding events (5.3%): 2 patients (2.7%) had mucosal bleeds that resolved after embolization of carotid branches, and 2 patients (2.7%) died from complications of CBOS. In the 2 patients with CBOS the D0.1cc was 48.4 Gy and 47.6 Gy, respectively. There was no significant association between bleeding events and D1cc (P = .280), D2cc (P = .571), or mean dose (P = .568). There was a trend toward increased risk of bleeding and D0.1cc (P = .080)., CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a low risk of bleeding after reirradiation with SBRT when 5 fractions are delivered on nonconsecutive days, even when tumor is completely encasing the carotid artery. Although limited by the low number of events, no significant association was found between dose-volume parameters and the risk of carotid bleeding. No CBOS was noted when D0.1cc was <47.6 Gy.

3127,"A Randomized Controlled Trial about the Levels of Radiation Exposure Depends on the Use of Collimation C-arm Fluoroscopic-guided Medial Branch Block. BACKGROUND: C-arm fluoroscope has been widely used to promote more effective pain management; however, unwanted radiation exposure for operators is inevitable. We prospectively investigated the differences in radiation exposure related to collimation in Medial Branch Block (MBB)., METHODS: This study was a randomized controlled trial of 62 MBBs at L3, 4 and 5. After the patient was laid in the prone position on the operating table, MBB was conducted and only AP projections of the fluoroscope were used. Based on a concealed random number table, MBB was performed with (collimation group) and without (control group) collimation. The data on the patient's age, height, gender, laterality (right/left), radiation absorbed dose (RAD), exposure time, distance from the center of the field to the operator, and effective dose (ED) at the side of the table and at the operator's chest were collected. The brightness of the fluoroscopic image was evaluated with histogram in Photoshop., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, height, weight, male to female ratio, laterality, time, distance and brightness of fluoroscopic image. The area of the fluoroscopic image with collimation was 67% of the conventional image. The RAD (29.9 +/- 13.0, P = 0.001) and the ED at the left chest of the operators (0.53 +/- 0.71, P = 0.042) and beside the table (5.69 +/- 4.6, P = 0.025) in collimation group were lower than that of the control group (44.6 +/- 19.0, 0.97 +/- 0.92, and 9.53 +/- 8.16), resepectively., CONCLUSIONS: Collimation reduced radiation exposure and maintained the image quality. Therefore, the proper use of collimation will be beneficial to both patients and operators.",Excluded
2119,"A novel lunar bed rest analogue. INTRODUCTION: Humans will eventually return to the Moon and thus there is a need for a ground-based analogue to enable the study of physiological adaptations to lunar gravity. An important unanswered question is whether or not living on the lunar surface will provide adequate loading of the musculoskeletal system to prevent or attenuate the bone loss that is seen in microgravity. Previous simulations have involved tilting subjects to an approximately 9.5 degrees angle to achieve a lunar gravity component parallel to the long-axis of the body. However, subjects in these earlier simulations were not weight-bearing, and thus these protocols did not provide an analogue for load on the musculoskeletal system., METHODS: We present a novel analogue which includes the capability to simulate standing and sitting in a lunar loading environment. A bed oriented at a 9.5 degrees angle was mounted on six linear bearings and was free to travel with one degree of freedom along rails. This allowed approximately 1/6 body weight loading of the feet during standing. Lunar"" sitting was also successfully simulated., RESULTS: A feasibility study demonstrated that the analogue was tolerated by subjects for 6 d of continuous bed rest and that the reaction forces at the feet during periods of standing were a reasonable simulation of lunar standing. During the 6 d, mean change in the volume of the quadriceps muscles was -1.6% +/- 1.7%., DISCUSSION: The proposed analogue would appear to be an acceptable simulation of lunar gravity and deserves further exploration in studies of longer duration.""",Excluded

We present a case of osteopathia striata with cranial sclerosis (OS-CS) in an 18 year old female who presented to our clinic for evaluation of cranial sclerosis (CS). The diagnosis of CS followed work-up for sensorineural hearing loss, which revealed bilateral internal auditory canal stenosis. On presentation, she complained of daily frontal headaches, weekly migraines and right knee pain. Medical history was remarkable for a cleft palate, delayed dental eruptions, hearing loss necessitating hearing aids and irregular menses. She had not sustained any fractures. Family history was negative for bone disorders, neurological disorders or endocrinopathies. Examination revealed a well-nourished female below the mid-parental height who was normocephalic with evidence of a prominent jaw, blue sclera and hypertelorism. Musculoskeletal exam was remarkable for scoliosis and shortened 4th and 5th metacarpals. Neurologic exam was remarkable for myopia and deafness. She had a normal intellect. Work-up revealed normal bone specific alk phos, TRAP, calcium, phosphate, PTH and IGF-1 levels. 24 hr urine calcium studies were normal. Vitamin D level was 21ng/ml. Head CT imaging revealed diffuse osteosclerosis of the calvarium and the skull base with osseous encroachment of the bilateral middle ear cavities. There was hypo-pneumatization of the mastoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. DXA scan showed Z scores of: 4.1 at lumbar spine, 2.0 at left total hip, 4.7 at left femoral neck and -1.5 at 1/3 radius. Thoracic spine X-ray showed mild scoliosis. Radiographs of the femurs revealed vertically orientated sclerotic striations extending from the metaphysis to the diaphysis. Radiographs of the pelvis revealed radiating striations extending into the iliac crests. OS-CS, also known as Horan-Beighton syndrome, is a rare X-linked dominant sclerosing bone dysplasia, characterized by dense linear striations of long bones & pelvis, CS and extra-skeletal anomalies such as congenital heart disease, respiratory & renal tract abnormalities. It is caused by a mutation in the WTX (Wilm Tumor on X chromosome) gene and is often lethal in males (1). Patients may remain asymptomatic or present with complications secondary to CS, namely cranial nerve entrapment. It is important to make a diagnosis of OS-CS to enable appropriate genetic testing and enable further testing for extra-skeletal anomalies.",Excluded
3252,"Influence of C-reactive protein levels and age on the value of D-dimer in diagnosing pulmonary embolism. Background: Recently, the number of performed CT-angiographies to diagnose pulmonary embolism (PE) rised markedly, while the incidence of PE hardly increased. This low yield of CT-angiography leads to more patients exposed to radiation and higher costs. Aim(s): The diagnostic value of age, C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer in PE was investigated. Additionally an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff level [age-adjusted cutoff = age/100 mg/L] was compared with the conventional cutoff level in diagnosing PE for patients >=50 yr. Method(s): This observational study (2004-2007) included all consecutive patients suspected for PE presenting on the emergency department with a performed CT-angiography after measuring CRP and D-dimer levels. Result(s): Of 4609 patients suspected for PE, 1164 patients underwent CT-angiography of whom 309 (26.5%) had PE. Correlation between CRP and D-dimer was 0.42 (P < 0.001). D-dimer and age correlated positively (rs = 0.33, P < 0.001), but only in patients >50 yr and independent of PE. Multivariate regression analysis showed significant contribution of age, D-dimer and age-adjusted D-dimer for diagnosing PE, but not for CRP. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff value increased specificity from 37% to 50%, whereas sensitivity declined from 96% to 90%. Applying this age-adjusted cutoff level in patients >=70 yr, specificity increased from 18% to 40%, while sensitivity decreased from 96% to 88%. Conclusion(s): In the prediction of PE, age and D-dimer levels are relevant, while CRP level is not. Using an age-adjusted D-dimer cutoff in older patients remarkably improves the specificity of D-dimer testing with a minor decline in sensitivity. This may increase the yield of CT-angiography in diagnosing PE. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded

45,Protective effect of flavonoids from Astragalus complanatus on radiation induced damages in mice. This study aimed to evaluate the radioprotective effect of flavonoids extracted from the seeds of Astragalus complanatus R.Br. (FAC) and their protective mechanism against radiation damage. FAC increased the survival rate of mice and made the damaged organ injured by 60Co gamma-irradiation recovered to normal appearance with the mechanism of enhancing immune function and blood-producing function in vivo. The molecule mechanism of FAC against radiation is involved in the reduction of DNA injury and mutation in vitro. Eleven monomers of the FAC were analyzed by HPLC. These results seem to support the use of FAC in relieving radiation damage. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,Excluded
1274,"Ultrasound Guidance Reduces Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Cost Compared to Fluoroscopy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost factors associated with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and to determine which method can be performed at a lower cost per case., METHODS: A cost comparison study was performed utilizing clinical data from a prospectively maintained research database. We included the most recent 33 consecutive ultrasound-guided PCNL cases in 2016 and the most recent 40 consecutive fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases before the operative surgeon transitioned to ultrasound guidance in May 2014. The total operative time and clinical outcomes were examined. Costs were extracted from the institution accounting systems and given a uniform multiplier to protect institutional financial reporting confidentiality. Comparisons were made using the Student t test and the chi-squared test., RESULTS: After excluding outliers, 71 PCNL procedures were included in the analysis. Demographic data and stone characteristics were not different between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided groups. However, the mean operative time for ultrasound-guided PCNL was significantly shorter (99.8 +/- 27.0 vs 144.9 +/- 55.1 minutes, P < .05). When capital equipment costs were included, the mean total cost per case of ultrasound-guided PCNL was approximately 30% less than fluoroscopy-guided PCNL (simulated costs with a uniform multiplier; $5258.90 +/- 957.12 vs $7508.60 +/- 1163.83, P < .05). Postoperative clinical outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: When capital costs are included, ultrasound-guided PCNL can produce comparable clinical outcomes to fluoroscopy-guided procedures at a lower cost to the institution. Shorter operative time drives significant savings with the adoption of ultrasound guidance, which may be magnified with increasing case volume. Using ultrasound imaging during PCNL may be more cost-effective compared to fluoroscopy and warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Objectives: To examine the efficacy of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in elderly patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (>=. 70. years of age) from a pooled analysis of four prospective trials. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30. Gy/15 or 25. Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy. Result(s): Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0. months vs. 7.6. months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR. =. 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p=. 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p=. 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR. =. 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p=. 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p=. 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery. Conclusion(s): PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
543,"Use of 120 kilovolt tube potential for digital subtraction angiography and fluoroscopy in an image-intensifier angiographic system: Decrease of skin dose in transarterial chemoembolization therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. In an image-intensifier angiographic system, the tube potential is commonly regulated in ranges from 75 to 90 kV for digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and fluoroscopy in transarterial chemoembolization therapy (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not a 120-kV tube potential could be used for DSA and fluoroscopy in TACE to decrease the skin dose. Forty-three patients administered TACE were randomly allocated into two groups: TACE was performed using standard-kilovoltage (75- to 90-kV) DSA and fluoroscopy modes (group A; n = 20) or using high-kilovoltage (120-kV) modes (group B; n = 23). The peak skin dose was compared between the groups. One case in group A was excluded from the study because the HCC nodule was not depicted on DSA. The peak skin dose (mGy) for group A was 383.6 +/- 176.5 and that for group B was 265.1 +/- 145.1. The peak skin dose was decreased by 31% in the 120-kV mode, a statistically significant difference (t-test, p = 0.022). We conclude that the use of 120 kV tube potential for DSA and fluoroscopy may be one option for performing TACE while decreasing the skin dose. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

However, further studies should be conducted because the information about the benefits of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the control of local or systemic symptoms of MCS remains insufficient.",Excluded
1326,"Improved clinical outcome in indolent B-cell lymphoma patients vaccinated with autologous tumor cells experiencing immunogenic death. Increasing evidence argues that the success of an anticancer treatment may rely on immunoadjuvant side effects including the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death. Based on the assumption that this death mechanism is a similar prerequisite for the efficacy of an active immunotherapy using killed tumor cells, we examined a vaccination strategy using dendritic cells (DC) loaded with apoptotic and necrotic cell bodies derived from autologous tumors. Using this approach, clinical and immunologic responses were achieved in 6 of 18 patients with relapsed indolent non - Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The present report illustrates an impaired ability of the neoplastic cells used to vaccinate nonresponders to undergo immunogenic death on exposure to a cell death protocol based on heat shock, gamma-ray, and UVC ray. Interestingly, when compared with doxorubicin, this treatment increased surface translocation of calreticulin and cellular release of high-mobility group box 1 and ATP in histologically distinct NHL cell lines. In contrast, treated lymphoma cells from responders displayed higher amounts of calreticulin and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) compared with those from nonresponders and boosted the production of specific antibodies when loaded into DCs for vaccination. Accordingly, the extent of calreticulin and HSP90 surface expression in the DC antigenic cargo was significantly associated with the clinical and immunologic responses achieved. Our results indicate that a positive clinical effect is obtained when immunogenically killed autologous neoplastic cells are used for the generation of a DC-based vaccine. Therapeutic improvements may thus be accomplished by circumventing the tumor-impaired ability to undergo immunogenic death and prime the antitumor immune response. ©2010 AACR.",Excluded

Purpose: We have been using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for selective neck irradiation. This article presents an analysis of patterns of failure and their dosimetric correlation. Methods and Materials: Between October 2003 and January 2008, 83 patients with head-and-neck cancer were treated with IMRT. Nodal levels were contoured as per the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) consensus guidelines. Result(s): There were 32 relapses with 23 local relapses (21 local relapses alone and 2 local and regional relapses, simultaneously), 9 regional relapses (including 2 simultaneous local and regional relapses), and 5 distant relapses, of which 2 patients had local relapses. At 2 and 3 years, the locoregional relapse-free survival rates were was 68.3% and 60.8%, respectively, while the overall survival rates were 84.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed significant differences in locoregional relapse-free survival rates for total treatment times of <53 days vs. >53 days, a volume of CTV1PTV (i.e., the volume prescribed 70 Gy) <177 cc vs. >177 cc, a V100 for CTV1PTV of <91% vs. >91%, and a minimum dose to CTV1PTV of <54 Gy vs. >54 Gy. There were no failures in the elective nodal volume, substantiating both the nodal selection criteria and the RTOG consensus guidelines for delineation of neck node levels. Conclusion(s): IMRT for head-neck cancer is feasible, using elective nodal selection criteria along with RTOG consensus guidelines for the radiological boundaries of levels of neck nodes. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

2540,"Patient awareness, perception and attitude to contrast-enhanced CT examination: Implications for communication and compliance with patients' preferences. Background. Despite the high volume of contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) examinations, there is limited awareness about its risks among patients and little is known about the influence of patient information sheets. Objectives. The objective of this study was to assess patients' awareness and perception of risks related to CECT examination and how they are influenced by an information sheet. Material and methods. A total of 263 adult patients scheduled for a CECT examination completed a questionnaire. The first page evaluated patients' characteristics, their fear and awareness about examination-related risks, and source of information. Page 2 contained the Zung self-rating anxiety scale. After reading the information sheet, patients completed page 3 that surveyed how their awareness and fear had changed. Results. Nearly half of the patients underestimated the risk of secondary malignancy (n = 121, 46%), or the risk of renal impairment (n = 110, 42%). The vast majority (n = 227, 86%) stated that they were not instructed to maintain fluid intake up to 1 h before the procedure. After reading the information sheet, patients generally corrected their knowledge, but 195 (74%) reported experiencing greater fear (p < 0.0001). Fear was more pronounced in younger female patients who had not undergone CT previously. Patients feared the result more than examination-related risks. Most patients (n = 204, 78%) would feel uncomfortable before receiving the examination result. Conclusions. Most patients do not assess risks related to CECT examination correctly. Although the information sheet improves patients' understanding of CECT-related risks, it lacks empathically delivered reassurance and increases their fear. Fast communication of examination results would make patients feel more comfortable.Copyright © 2019 by Wroclaw Medical University.",Excluded
3444,"A comparison between unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral puncture techniques in percutaneous kyphoplasty. Study Design. A prospective comparative study. Objective. To assess the clinical and radiological outcomes for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using unilateral transverse process-pedicle and bilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP). Summary of Background Data. PKP is a widely used vertebral augmentation procedure for treating painful vertebral compression fractures. A percutaneous bilateral approach is typically used to access the vertebral body. Many previous studies have reported excellent clinical results with PKP. In contrast, numerous complications and problems have also been reported, such as puncture diffi culty, cement leakage, and adjacent vertebral fracture. Methods. This prospective study included 316 patients with singlelevel lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, 224 females and 92 males with a mean age of 71.5 years. Randomized patients underwent PKP using 2 different puncture techniques. The patients were followed up postoperatively and were assessed mainly with regard to clinical and radiological outcomes. Clinical outcomes were evaluated mainly using the visual analogue scale for pain and 36- Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for health status. Radiological outcomes were assessed mainly on the basis of radiation dose, bone cement distribution, vertebral body height, and kyphotic angle. Results. Patients were followed up from 12 to 28 months, with an average of 16.8 months. One hundred fi fty-eight patients were treated with unilateral method and 151 patients were treated with bilateral method. In the unilateral group, the volume of the injected cement and radiation dose were signifi cantly less than that in the bilateral group. All patients in both groups had signifi cantly less pain after the procedures, compared with their preoperative period pain. No statistically signifi cant differences were observed when visual analogue scale and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey were compared between the groups. Both unilateral and bilateral groups showed insignifi cant decrease in the kyphotic angle during the follow-ups. The kyphotic angle in the unilateral group improved more signifi cantly than in the bilateral group. In the bilateral group, 16 patients had obvious pain in the puncture sites at 1 month postoperatively caused by facet joint violation. With local block treatment, the pain disappeared in all patients at the last follow-up. Conclusion. Both bilateral and unilateral PKP are relatively safe and provide effective treatment for patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. However, unilateral PKP received less radiation dose and operation time, it also offered a higher degree of deformity correction and resulted in less complication than bilateral PKP.Copyright © 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

Median survival times for the NRI classes (no denutrition, moderate and severe denutrition) were 29.5, 19.7, and 12 months (P = 0.0004), respectively. A major impact of baseline NRI was found in terms of survival; it should be included in future prospective trials. © 2012, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.",Excluded
1847,"The radiologic technologists' health study in South Korea: study design and baseline results. PURPOSE: To describe the study design, methods, and baseline results of a prospective cohort of radiologic technologists which we have initiated in South Korea., METHODS: The cohort participants were enrolled through a self-administered questionnaire survey administered from April 2012 to May 2013. Survey data were linked with radiation dosimetry, a cancer registry, and health insurance data by personal identification numbers. A nationwide representative survey was also conducted using a stratified random sampling design with face-to-face interviews., RESULTS: A total of 12,387 radiologic technologists were enrolled, which accounted for approximately 63% of all diagnostic radiologic technologists working in South Korea. For nationwide survey, 585 workers were interviewed using the detailed questionnaire, and buccal cells were also collected by scraping the inside of the cheek. The majority of study subjects were under 50-year-old and male workers. The average annual effective dose of radiation declined both men (from 2.75 to 1.43 mSv) and women (from 1.34 to 0.95 mSv) over the period of 1996-2011. A total of 99 cancers (66 cancers in men and 33 in women) were reported from 1992 to 2010. The standardized incidence ratio of all cancer combined was significantly lower in men (SIR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.58-0.96) than general population, but the ratios for thyroid cancer were significantly higher than expected among both men and women., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort provides comprehensive information on work activities and health status of diagnostic radiologic technologists. In addition, the nationwide representative sample provides unique opportunities compared with previous radiologic technologist studies.",Excluded
377,"Integrated circuit detector technology in abdominal CT: added value in obese patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to assess the effect of an integrated circuit (IC) detector for abdominal CT on image quality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first study part, an abdominal phantom was scanned with various extension rings using a CT scanner equipped with a conventional discrete circuit (DC) detector and on the same scanner with an IC detector (120 kVp, 150 effective mAs, and 75 effective mAs). In the second study part, 20 patients were included who underwent abdominal CT both with the IC detector and previously at similar protocol parameters (120 kVp tube current-time product and 150 reference mAs using automated tube current modulation) with the DC detector. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection., RESULTS: Image quality in the phantom was higher for images acquired with the IC compared with the DC detector. There was a gradually increasing noise reduction with increasing phantom sizes, with the highest (37% in the largest phantom) at 75 effective mAs (p < 0.001). In patients, noise was overall significantly (p = 0.025) reduced by 6.4% using the IC detector. Similar to the phantom, there was a gradual increase in noise reduction to 7.9% in patients with a body mass index of 25 kg/m(2) or lower (p = 0.008). Significant correlation was found in patients between noise and abdominal diameter in DC detector images (r = 0.604, p = 0.005), whereas no such correlation was found for the IC detector (r = 0.427, p = 0.060)., CONCLUSION: Use of an IC detector in abdominal CT improves image quality and reduces image noise, particularly in overweight and obese patients. This noise reduction has the potential for dose reduction in abdominal CT.",Excluded
180,"Delivered dose and vascular response after beta-radiation for in-stent restenosis: retrospective dosimetry and volumetric intravascular ultrasound analysis. BACKGROUND: Observations from previous intracoronary radiation therapy trials noted a considerable discrepancy between the prescribed radiation dose and the dose actually delivered. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of actual delivered dose on vascular changes and to test the appropriateness of the current dose prescription., METHODS AND RESULTS: Serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) analysis was performed in 30 in-stent restenosis cases treated with a 40-mm (90)Sr/Y source train. The fixed dose was prescribed at 2 mm from the centerline of the source train (18.4 Gy at 2 mm for reference diameter or =3.36 mm). Only stent segments with full radiation coverage and device injury were enrolled and divided into 2-mm-long subsegments (n=202). D(S90)EEM (the minimum dose absorbed by 90% of the external elastic membrane surface) was calculated as the delivered dose corresponding to each segment, assuming that the radiation catheter occupied the same position in the vessel as the IVUS catheter. Mean D(S90)EEM of 23.5+/-5.82 Gy (range 12.3 to 41.7 Gy) was delivered to these subsegments. Overall, intimal hyperplasia volume remained constant from postintervention to follow-up (2.23+/-1.10 to 2.32+/-1.09 mm3/m; P=NS). Regression analysis revealed there was no correlation between delivered dose intensity and changes in intimal hyperplasia volume. No particular dose-dependent complications were appreciated in this delivered dose range., CONCLUSIONS: The current dose-prescription protocol of (90)Sr/Y radiation to native in-stent restenosis lesions may provide substantial inhibition of neointimal reproliferation regardless of the actual delivered dose intensity.",Excluded
2307,"A single-center pilot study for radiosensitization of everolimus with external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine liver metastasis. Background: Liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NELM) are common. Given the benefit of everolimus (E) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors and its additive effect to radiotherapy (RT) in other histologies, this study evaluated safety and efficacy of concurrent E with RT for NELM. Method(s): Prospective study of 14 patients with <4 NELM, progressing on standard therapy, treated with E for 28 days prior to, concurrent with, and 14 days following RT. A safety run-in of 2 patients at E 2.5 mg daily, then 5 mg daily were completed prior to treating 10 patients with 7.5 mg daily. RTwas delivered using either conventional radiation (cRT) 30 Gy in 10 fractions or stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) 35-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Per lesion response was evaluated per RECIST v1.1, and toxicity per the CTCAE v4.03. Result(s): 40 NELM were treated in 14 patients (7 male and 7 female), with a median age of 63 (47-88). Primaries included lung (4), small bowel (6), colorectal (3) and renal (1); Gr.I/typical lung (4) and Gr.II/atypical lung (10). Median radiation dose delivered (BED10) was 72 Gy (range 39-180). The overall response rate (ORR) was 33%; no patients developed progression at a treated NELM in the 12 month follow-up period. Median change in size per metastasis was -23%(-100% to 7%). 1 patient developed pseudoprogression. Median time to best response was 9 months. One patient at the 7.5mg dose discontinued E post-RT due to Grade 2 thrombocytopenia, and one patient at the 7.5 mg dose had Grade 3 hypertension which resolved after completing E. Conclusion(s): Concurrent E and liver RT is safe. No patients developed progression of their treated NELM in the 12 months post treatment; further follow-up is required to determine long-term control. Combination E and RT may be an option for patients with low-volume NELM; further investigation is warranted for this promising approach.",Excluded

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Histopathologic diagnosis of fluoroscopy-induced radiation ulcer (FIRU) can be challenging if the past history of radiation exposure is unknown. Morphea is the most important differential diagnosis. This study was intended to identify clinical and pathologic features that can be used to distinguish FIRU from morphea., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study on 25 specimens from 15 patients with FIRU and 21 specimens from 21 patients with morphea. Clinical findings and pathological features were analyzed., RESULTS: Thirteen of 15 patients (86.7 %) with FIRU underwent angioplasty for coronary artery disease, and eleven patients had lesions in the right subscapular area. Compared with morphea, FIRU patients were more likely to display non-inflammatory infiltrates (28 %), bizarre fibroblasts (100 %), sclerosis (48 %), telangiectasia (96 %), vascular damage (64 %), and loss of skin appendages (100 %). In morphea, bizarre fibroblasts were rare (14 %), while telangiectasia (62 %) and loss of skin appendages (62 %) were variable. Loss of CD34+ cells and compression of elastic fibers could not be used to distinguish between FIRU and morphea., CONCLUSIONS: Skin lesion in the right subscapular area with presence of bizarre fibroblasts, sclerosis, telangiectasia, and loss of cutaneous appendages as seen with histology are highly characteristic of the radiation damage associated with fluoroscopic angiography.

231,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma with exclusive involvement of a functioning recurrent laryngeal nerve may be treated with shaving technique. OBJECTIVES: We sought to validate the feasibility of preserving a functioning recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) invaded by papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) using a shaving technique followed by high-dose radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy., METHODS: A retrospective review of 34 patients with locally invasive PTC who had exclusive tumor involvement of a functioning RLN was performed. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy and high-dose RAI therapy. A shaving technique was conducted with the goal of leaving the smallest amount of residual tumor as possible while attempting to preserve nerve function. Clinicopathologic factors and oncologic outcomes of the patients with resected RLN (group A, n = 14) and preserved RLN (group B, n = 20) were compared., RESULTS: The two groups showed no differences in clinicopathologic factors or follow-up period. Mean dose of radioiodine therapy was 245.0 +/- 140.3 mCi (range 100-540 mCi). Permanent postoperative vocal cord paralysis after RLN shaving occurred in two patients of group B (10%). Only one patient (5%) in group B had local recurrence at the thyroid bed where the residual tumor was located. The overall recurrence rate was 35.7% (5/14) and 20.0% (4/20) in groups A and B, respectively showing no significant difference (p = 0.525). There were no cases of death due to PTC during the median follow-up of 75 months (range 36-159 months)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with locally invasive PTC with exclusive involvement of a functioning RLN may be treated by nerve shaving followed by treatment of the macroscopic residual tumor with high-dose RAI therapy.",Excluded
407,"Instrument for near infrared emission spectroscopic probing of human fingertips in vivo. We present instrumentation for probing of volar side fingertip capillary beds with free space coupled near infrared light while collecting Raman, Rayleigh, and Mie scattered light as well as fluorescence. Fingertip skin capillary beds are highly vascularized relative to other tissues and present a desirable target for noninvasive probing of blood. But human hands and fingers in particular are also highly idiosyncratic body parts requiring specific apparatus to allow careful and methodical spectroscopic probing. The apparatus includes means for precise and reproducible placement of the tissues relative to the optical aperture. Appropriate means are provided for applying and maintaining pressure to keep surface tissues immobile during experiments while obtaining the desired blood content and flow. Soft matter, e.g., skin, extrudes into the aperture in response to any applied pressure, e.g., to keep the tissue in registration with the optical system, so the position, contact area, pressure, and force are continuously measured and recorded to produce feedback for an actuator applying force and to discern the compliance of the test subject. The compliance strongly affects the reliability of the measurement and human factors must be adequately managed in the case of in vivo probing. The apparatus produces reproducible observations and measurements that allow consistent probing of the tissues of a wide range of skin types.",Excluded

1697,"Photic retinopathy after cataract surgery in diabetic patients. PURPOSE: To report and emphasize photic retinopathy (PR) after cataract surgery in diabetic patients., METHODS: The charts of 2,573 patients who underwent cataract surgery at Baskent University Hospital (Ankara, Turkey) between January 2001 and December 2003 were retrospectively analyzed for PR and diabetes mellitus (DM). All surgeries were performed using the same coaxial illuminated microscope. The diagnosis of PR was confirmed by fluorescein angiography, showing typical mottled fluorescein transmission in a well circumscribed area in each case. Statistical analyses were performed with chi2 and Mann-Whitney U tests., RESULTS: Diagnoses of PR and DM were established in 16 cases (0.62%) and 382 cases (14.85%), respectively. DM was present in 7 (43.75%) of the PR cases. PR occurred more frequently in DM patients than in non-DM patients (7/382 vs. 9/2,191, respectively; P = 0.001; chi2= 10.64). All 16 patients with PR had received retrobulbar anesthesia (RA). RA was used in 61.21% of all surgeries and in 78.01% of the surgeries for DM patients. Occurrence of PR during RA was higher for DM patients than for non-DM patients (7/298 vs. 9/1,277, respectively; P = 0.011; chi2= 6.50). Mean operation times +/- SD for PR cases were 29.9 +/- 9.9 minutes and 38.2 +/- 5.3 minutes in DM and non-DM cases, respectively (P = 0.091). None of the photic lesions were sight threatening., CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients may be more vulnerable to photic injury. Surgeons should take precautions to prevent PR when performing cataract surgery on diabetic patients.",Excluded

We therefore present the results of 66 cases treated with the Finn/OSS knee system with an average follow-up of 5. years (range 2-12). Indications included 63 revision cases and three primary interventions with either massive bone loss and/or soft tissue deficiency. At final follow-up the average knee society score had significantly improved from 46 preoperatively to 73, and the function score improved from 27 to 47 points. Four cases needed to be revised: one for recurrent infection, two for aseptic loosening and one for implant breakage. Nine patients underwent minor reinterventions; including five cases with irrigation and debridement for prolonged wound drainage, two patellar realignment procedures and two extensor mechanism repairs. Two patients developed a peroneal nerve palsy. Overall implant survivorship with revision as the endpoint was 92% at 5 and 10. years. We conclude that the use of a resection prosthesis in the complex primary and revision TKA leads to acceptable results, but the complication rate is relatively high. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

The clinical and technical characteristics of the first ten proton beam radiotherapy treatments are reported. Ten patients, six males and four females (age range 27-73 years, median 55.5), were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. After one to two surgical procedures, seven patients received a histological diagnosis of chordoma (of the skull base in three cases, the cervical spine in one case and the sacrum in three cases) and three of low-grade chondrosarcoma (skull base). Prescribed doses were 74 GyE for chordoma and 70 GyE for chondrosarcoma at 2 GyE/fraction delivered 5 days per week. Treatment was well tolerated without toxicity-related interruptions. The maximal acute toxicity was grade 2, with oropharyngeal mucositis, nausea and vomiting for the skull base tumours, and grade 2 dermatitis for the sacral tumours. After 6-12 months of follow-up, no patient developed tumour progression. The analysis of the first ten patients treated with proton therapy at CNAO showed that this treatment was feasible and safe.

898,"Bowel preparation before intravenous urography: is it necessary?. Whether or not bowel preparation should be used before intravenous urography (IVU) remains a controversial issue. Despite strongly held views on both sides there is little scientific evidence to support either viewpoint. We have conducted a prospective randomized study designed to test the hypothesis that adequate bowel preparation before IVU facilitates better quality studies requiring fewer films and consequently less time and a lower radiation exposure. Data on 188 patients were analysed; 90 patients received bowel preparation and 98 received no bowel preparation. There was no difference between the groups in terms of the number of films taken, the duration of the procedure, the visibility of the renal tracts or the overall quality of the studies. The prepared group did have significantly less faecal residue than the unprepared group. However, the renal tract visibility was no greater, as the combination of gas and haustral folds seen after bowel preparation obscured fine detail of the urinary tract as effectively as faecal residue. The hypothesis that adequate bowel preparation before IVU facilitates better quality studies must therefore be rejected.",Excluded

1946,"Innate immune responses of Drosophila melanogaster are altered by spaceflight. Alterations and impairment of immune responses in humans present a health risk for space exploration missions. The molecular mechanisms underpinning innate immune defense can be confounded by the complexity of the acquired immune system of humans. Drosophila (fruit fly) innate immunity is simpler, and shares many similarities with human innate immunity at the level of molecular and genetic pathways. The goals of this study were to elucidate fundamental immune processes in Drosophila affected by spaceflight and to measure host-pathogen responses post-flight. Five containers, each containing ten female and five male fruit flies, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours. A new generation of flies was reared in microgravity. In larvae, the immune system was examined by analyzing plasmatocyte number and activity in culture. In adults, the induced immune responses were analyzed by bacterial clearance and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of selected genes following infection with E. coli. The RNA levels of relevant immune pathway genes were determined in both larvae and adults by microarray analysis. The ability of larval plasmatocytes to phagocytose E. coli in culture was attenuated following spaceflight, and in parallel, the expression of genes involved in cell maturation was downregulated. In addition, the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide (AMP) pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity, were also reduced in larvae. In adults, the efficiency of bacterial clearance measured in vivo following a systemic infection with E. coli post-flight, remained robust. We show that spaceflight altered both cellular and humoral immune responses in Drosophila and that the disruption occurs at multiple interacting pathways.",Excluded

Objectives: This prospective investigation was carried out in order to evaluate the accuracy of vertebral fracture assessment by DXA using GE iDXA device (GE Medical Systems Lunar, Madison, WI, USA) compared to conventional radiography. Materials/Methods: We enrolled 273 subjects (207 females and 68 males, age range 28-85 years) consecutively studied at our Mineral Metabolism Centre, which were undergoing a spine vertebral X-ray evaluation. Lateral images of the spine, from T4 to L4, by both conventional X-ray and iDXA device, were acquired in each subject on the same day, after informed consent was obtained. The radiographs were evaluated by an experienced skeletal radiologist (D.D.), using the semiquantitative (SQ) method. The iDXA images were evaluated by a trained operator using a specific software (enCORE). Result(s): By means of SQ radiological technique, we evaluated 3,515 (99%) of the 3,549 available vertebrae, and identified 151 vertebral deformities (101mild and 50moderate or severe). By means of iDXA we visualized 3,405 (96%) vertebrae and identified 150 vertebral deformities (100 mild and 50 moderate or severe). Ninety-two subjects (33.7% of the total sample) were identified as having vertebral fractures by SQ Rx technique and eighty-seven subjects (31.9%) fractured were recognized by iDXA (chi2 = n.s.). A single fracture was detected in 66 patients (24.2%) by conventional radiographs and in 59 subjects (21.6%) by iDXA; 26 subjects (9.5%) had multiple vertebral fractures detected by SQ Rx technique and 28 subjects (10.2%) by iDXA . Considering radiological SQ assessment as the gold standard, iDXA sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was 96% (Positive Predictive Value 88%; Negative Predictive Value 97%). Agreement between radio-graphs and iDXA was 96% with a kappa statistic of 0.91 (confidence interval 0.82-0.96). Conclusion(s): According to the results obtained, iDXA and SQ radiological technique demonstrated good agreement in classifying vertebrae as normal or deformed. Therefore, since iDXA performs spine images with good resolution and lower dose, it proves to be useful in the clinical evaluation of patients at risk of osteoporosis or for the selection of patients for osteoporosis-related clinical trials.",Excluded
1148,"Organ transplant recipients and skin cancer: Assessment of risk factors with focus on sun exposure. SummaryBackground Organ transplant recipients (OTRs) have an increased risk of developing skin cancer, especially epithelial tumours. A number of factors such as immunosuppression, age, ultraviolet radiation and skin type are considered as important in aetiology. Objectives The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the risk factors for OTRs regarding skin cancer after transplantation. A detailed investigation of the specific compounds of sun exposure was realised. Methods A questionnaire-based study was performed in a specialist OTR dermatology clinic from January to April 2009. The subjects were 70 organ transplanted patients who had developed some form of skin cancer after transplantation. As controls served 69 organ transplanted patients who had no history of skin cancer. The controls were matched concerning age, transplanted organ and gender. Photo protection, sun exposure and transplantation data were part of the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney-U-test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. Results The total sun burden (TSB) and the recreational sun exposure in particular attained higher scores in the skin cancer group (TSB-score: mean 11.8 vs. 10.0, P < 0.05; recreational sun exposure: mean 6.3 vs. 5.1, P < 0.05). The skin cancer group had fairer skin types than the control group (median skin type 2 vs. 3, P < 0.05). The OTRs who developed skin cancer have been more likely to have a history or present intake of azathioprine (mean 42% vs. 21%, P < 0.05). Also, the skin cancer group has been transplanted for a longer time (mean 12.3 vs. 7.2 years, P < 0.001), analogously had a younger age at transplantation (mean 49.5 vs. 52.7 years, P < 0.001). Conclusions Recreational sun exposure is of central importance for OTRs. A long period of transplantation and thus immunosuppression presents a main risk factor for the development of skin cancer in OTRs. A multi disciplinary management with the best medication and a focus on sun protection is needed to prevent skin cancer in OTRs. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists.",Excluded

All patients had CBCT and sonographic imaging and received sialendoscopy to confirm and possibly treat sialolithiasis., RESULTS: Sonography, CBCT, and sialendoscopy together indicated sialolithiasis in 33 patients. The mean maximum diameter of the extracted sialoliths did not significantly differ between the three diagnostics. Each diagnostic tool showed an excellent specificity and positive predictive value. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were best in sialendoscopy (94% resp. 83%), followed by CBCT (79% resp. 56%) and then sonography (70% resp. 47%)., CONCLUSION: The results revealed that CBCT is capable of diagnosing sialoliths in general and tended to be more sensitive than sonography. However, in view of the radiation exposure, the use of CBCT must be critically weighed and should not be used as a primary option., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

242,"Outcome and complications of distal tibia fractures treated with intramedullary nails versus minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis and the role of fibula fixation. Introduction: Distal tibia fractures have been managed conservatively as well surgically. A large number of implants have been used for surgical management of these fractures. No treatment method or implant has been proven to be superior to others. In this prospective comparative study, the complications and outcome of distal tibia fractures managed with intramedullary nails and minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis has been compared. Further, the role of fibula fixation in these fractures has been evaluated. Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred and fifty-four patients of distal tibia fractures with concomitant fibula fractures were randomized into 4 treatment groups based on predetermined inclusion criteria. Functional outcome in these groups was compared based on AOFAS score at 1 year. Intra-operative, post-operative parameters as well as radiological alignment, complications and the need for reoperation were also compared in these groups. Result(s): The functional outcome in all four treatment groups was similar. The duration of surgery and radiation exposure was higher with minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis. There was no improvement in outcome with plating of fibula. However, fixation of fibula improved the rotational alignment in distal tibia fractures. Conclusion(s): Although there is no difference in outcome of distal tibia fractures with either nailing or minimally invasive plating, nailing is recommended for closed displaced extraarticular fractures. Fixation of fibula should not be done routinely but should be reserved only for a few specific fracture patterns.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

To investigate the image quality and the minimum required radiation dose for automatic tube potential selection (ATPS) in dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Three hundred twenty-five consecutive patients (153 men and 172 women) undergoing CCTA were assigned to either the ATPS group (n = 172) or the control group (n = 153); the control group underwent imaging at a constant current of 120 kV. All patients were scanned in either prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch helical mode or sequential mode. The subjective image quality score, attenuation, image noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), and effective dose (ED) were compared between the two groups with the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The subjective image quality score was not significantly different between the two groups. Imaging noise and attenuation were both significantly higher in the ATPS group than in the control group (imaging noise: 25.6 +/- 7.6 versus 15.8 +/- 4.0 HU, P < 0.001; attenuation: 559.6 +/- 142.0 versus 412.5 +/- 64.3 HU, P < 0.001). SNR and CNR were significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (SNR: 23.21 +/- 7.40 versus 27.71 +/- 8.25, P < 0.001; CNR: 27.81 +/- 8.44 versus 33.94 +/- 9.69, P < 0.001). ED was significantly lower in the ATPS group than in the control group (ED: 1.25 +/- 1.24 versus 2.19 +/- 1.77 mSv, P < 0.001). For both groups, ED was significantly lower in the high-pitch mode than in the sequential mode. The use of ATPS for CCTA significantly reduced the radiation dose while maintaining image quality.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Excluded
249,"Fluselenamyl: Evaluation of radiation dosimetry in mice and pharmacokinetics in brains of non-human primate. Introduction: To allow quantitative assessment of therapeutic efficacy for therapeutic interventions (either approved or undergoing FDA approvals) for either inhibiting or reducing development of Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, 18F-labelled tracers, such as Florbetapir, Florbetaben, and Flutemetamol have been approved. Previously, we have reported on development and preclinical validation of 18F-Fluselenamyl, comprising traits of translatable Abeta imaging agents. Herein, we report the dosimetry data for 18F-Fluselenamyl to provide radiation dose deposited within organs and determine effective dose (ED) for human studies, while also evaluating its pharmacokinetics in the nonhuman primate brains. Method(s): To evaluate safety profiles of 18F-Fluselenamyl for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging agent for monitoring Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, we estimated the human radiation dosimetry extrapolated from rodent biodistribution data obtained by standard method of organ dissection. Animal biodistribution studies were performed in FVB/NCR mice (20 males, 20 females), following tail-vein injection of the tracer. Following euthanasia of mice, organs were harvested, counted, radiation dose to each organ and whole body was determined using the standard MIRD methodology. For evaluation of pharmacokinetics in non-human primates, following intravenous injection of the tracer, dynamic PET scan of rhesus monkey brains were performed, and co-registered with MR for anatomical reference. Parametric images of tracer transport rate constant and distribution volume relative to cerebellum were generated using a simplified reference tissue model and a spatially-constraint linear regression algorithm. Result(s): The critical organ in humans has been determined to be the gall bladder with a gender average radiation absorbed dose of 0.079 mGy/MBq with an effective dose of 0.017 mSv/MBq and 0.020 mSv/MBq, in males and females, respectively. Therefore, these data provide preliminary projections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates, thereby defining safe imaging conditions for further validations in human subjects. Additionally, the tracer penetrated the non-human primate brain and excreted to background levels at later-time points thus pointing to the potential for high signal/noise ratios during noninvasive imaging. Tissue time activity curves (TACs) also show fast initial uptake with maximum projection of activity at 2-6 min post administration followed by clearance of activity at later time-points from cortex, cerebellum, and white matter of nonhuman primate brain. Parametric images confirmed that the 18F-Fluselenamyl has relative high transport rate constant at striatum, thalamus, and cortex. Conclusion(s): The data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in mice indicate that 18F-Fluselenamyl can be safely used for further evaluation in humans. Additionally, 18F-Fluselenamyl demonstrated ability to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB) and indicated high initial influx, followed by clearance to background levels in non-human primate brains. Combined information indicates that 18F-Fluselenamyl would be a potential candidate for detecting amyloid plaques in the living human brain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

65,"Methods for assessing forward and backward light scatter in patients with cataract. PURPOSE: To compare objective methods for assessing backward and forward light scatter and psychophysical tests in patients with cataracts., SETTING: Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom., DESIGN: Prospective case series., METHODS: This study included patients scheduled for cataract surgery. Lens opacities were grouped into predominantly nuclear sclerotic, cortical, posterior subcapsular, and mixed cataracts. Backward light scatter was assessed using a rotating Scheimpflug imaging technique (Pentacam HR), forward light scatter using a straylight meter (C-Quant), and straylight using the double-pass method (Optical Quality Analysis System, point-spread function [PSF] meter). The results were correlated with visual acuity under photopic conditions as well as photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity., RESULTS: The study comprised 56 eyes of 56 patients. The mean age of the 23 men and 33 women was 71 years (range 48 to 84 years). Two patients were excluded. Of the remaining, 15 patients had predominantly nuclear sclerotic cataracts, 13 had cortical cataracts, 11 had posterior subcapsular cataracts, and 15 had mixed cataracts. Correlations between devices were low. The highest correlation was between PSF meter measurements and Scheimpflug measurements (r = 0.32). The best correlation between corrected distance visual acuity was with the PSF meter (r = 0.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Forward and backward light-scatter measurements cannot be used interchangeably. Scatter as an aspect of quality of vision was independent of acuity. Measuring forward light scatter with the straylight meter can be a useful additional tool in preoperative decision-making.

168,"Effective stepwise training and procedure standardization for young surgeons to perform laparoscopic left hepatectomy. Background: Laparoscopic hepatectomy remains one of the most difficult procedures for young surgeons to perform. We recently developed a new training method and standardization procedure for teaching young surgeons to perform laparoscopic left hepatectomy (Lap-LHx). The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of our method. Method(s): In 2004, we standardized a laparoscopic procedure for Lap-LHx, using a laparoscopy-assisted method as a stepping stone. The laparoscopic training method comprised the following three steps: (1) training in fundamental procedures using a dry box and checking by mentors; (2) detailed preoperative simulation using Vincent three-dimensional software for each patient; and (3) self-assessment including understanding of relevant anatomy and completion grade for each procedure using a check sheet and feedback by both mentors and a professor. Twenty-three Lap-LHx procedures performed during the study period were divided into two groups: those performed by young non-board-certified surgeons (n = 9) and those performed by senior board-certified surgeons (n = 14). Result(s): The blood loss and operative time were similar in the young surgeon (194 g and 336 min, respectively) and senior surgeon groups (208 g and 322 min, respectively). Conclusion(s): Our standardized Lap-LHx procedure and stepwise training to perform it enable young surgeons to perform Lap-LHx as confidently and safely as more experienced surgeons.Copyright © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
775,"Can we achieve a radionuclide radiation dose equal to or less than that of 99mTc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate bone scintigraphy with a low-dose 18F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET of diagnostic quality?. PURPOSE: F-Sodium fluoride is a bone tracer with a high signal-to-noise ratio, but its dosimetry is higher than that of Tc-labeled phosphonates at the recommended activities. The study's purpose was to determine whether the reduction by half of F-sodium fluoride-injected activity, mimicked by a short-timed reconstruction image, simulating a total dose less than or equal to that of Tc-hydroxymethane diphosphonate scintigraphy, had an impact on the accuracy of PET semiquantitative measurements and image quality. METHOD(S): Whole-body time-of-flight F-sodium fluoride PET/computed tomography (CT) images were acquired prospectively from 40 adult patients for detection of bone metastases. F-Sodium fluoride was administered according to the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and Society of Nuclear Medicine (SNM) practice guidelines. From the acquired 1 min/bed position list-mode data, 30-s reconstructions were extracted. Measurements of maximum standard uptake value were recorded with a region of interest applied to the same location on the 1-min and 30-s images, which were displayed side by side, and were analyzed using Bland-Altman plots. A masked reading was performed by two senior nuclear medicine physicians who counted the foci of visually increased uptake. RESULT(S): Bland-Altman plots showed an excellent agreement between the maximum standard uptake value measurements of the 60- and 30-s images. The paired Wilcoxon test results between the corresponding 60- and 30-s images read by masked readers A and B were not significant (P=0.15 and 0.19, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Reducing acquisition duration by half or injecting half of the activity recommended by the EANM and SNM practice guidelines can lead to F-sodium fluoride time-of-flight PET images of diagnostic quality, achieving a radiation dose less than or equal to that of Tc-labeled phosphonates.

3388,"What can space radiation protection learn from radiation oncology?. Protection from cosmic radiation of crews of long-term space missions is now becoming an urgent requirement to allow a safe colonization of the moon and Mars. Epidemiology provides little help to quantify the risk, because the astronaut group is small and as yet mostly involved in low-Earth orbit mission, whilst the usual cohorts used for radiation protection on Earth (e.g. atomic bomb survivors) were exposed to a radiation quality substantially different from the energetic charged particle field found in space. However, there are over 260,000 patients treated with accelerated protons or heavier ions for different types of cancer, and this cohort may be useful for quantifying the effects of space-like radiation in humans. Space radiation protection and particle therapy research also share the same tools and devices, such as accelerators and detectors, as well as several research topics, from nuclear fragmentation cross sections to the radiobiology of densely ionizing radiation. The transfer of the information from the cancer radiotherapy field to space is manifestly complicated, yet the two field should strengthen their relationship and exchange methods and data.Copyright © 2021",Excluded
3029,"Comparative study of DNA damage and repair in head and neck cancer after radiation treatment. We compared DNA damage and the efficacy of its repair after genotoxic treatment with gamma-radiation of lymphocytes and tissue cells isolated from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (HNSCC) and healthy donors. Thirty-seven subjects with HNSCC and 35 healthy donors were enrolled in the study. The extent of DNA damage including oxidative lesions and efficiency of the repair were examined by alkaline comet assay. HNSCC cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, lesions caused by gamma-radiation were repaired less effectively in metastasis of HNSCC than in healthy controls. The differences in radiation sensitivity of cancer and control cells suggested that DNA repair might be critical for HNSCC treatment. We conclude that gamma-radiation might be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy for head and neck cancers, including patients in advanced stage of the disease with clear evidence of metastasis.",Excluded
466,"A 20-minute breath test for helicobacter pylori. In this study, we evaluated a simplified rapid 14C-urea breath test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori. Fasting patients undergoing initial assessment for H. pylori drank 5 microCi of 14C-urea in 20 ml of water. Breath was collected at intervals for 30 min. Samples were counted in a beta-counter, and the results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm). In the same week, patients underwent endoscopy, and a blinded investigator examined biopsy samples of gastric mucosa by culture and histology for H. pylori. There were 49 H. pylori-negative (HP-) and 104 H. pylori-positive (HP+) patients in the study. HP+ patients expired a mean of 4398 cpm (SD 2468) per mmol CO2 in a sample taken 20 min after ingestion of the isotope. In contrast, HP--patients expired only 340 cpm (SD 196). If the mean +3 SD of HP- patients was used as a cutoff value, the 20-minute sample gave a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100% for detecting H. pylori. The radiation exposure from this test is less than 1% of that received from an upper gastrointestinal series, and the short collection time makes it both convenient and cost effective.",Excluded

Background: The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) has been identified as a new and practicable prognostic histological characteristic of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the TSR in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 93 patients who presented with NPC from 2004 to 2007 were studied. Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy was administered according to their Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages. The TSR was assessed visually on hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of biopsy specimens by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 66.67% and 54.91%, respectively, in the stroma-poor group and 40.48% and 33.33%, respectively, in the stroma-rich group. Both the 5-year OS and DFS rates in the stroma-poor group were significantly better than those in the stroma-rich group (p < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis, the TSR was identified as a highly significant prognostic factor for the 5-year OS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.999; p = 0.030) and the 5-year DFS (HR 1.925; p = 0.042).

336,"Effects of motion segment level, Pfirrmann intervertebral disc degeneration grade and gender on lumbar spine kinematics. MRI allows non-invasive assessment of intervertebral disc degeneration with the added clinical benefit of using non-ionizing radiation. What has remained unclear is the relationship between assessed disc degeneration and lumbar spine kinematics. Kinematic outcomes of 54 multi-segment (L1-Sacrum) lumbar spine specimens were calculated to discover if such an underlying relationship exists with degeneration assessed using the Pfirrmann grading system. Further analyses were also conducted to determine if kinematic outcomes were affected by motion segment level, gender or applied compressive preload. Range of motion, hysteresis, high flexibility zone size and rotational stiffness in flexion-extension, lateral bending and axial rotation were the kinematic outcomes. Caudal intervertebral discs in our study sample were more degenerative than cranial discs. L5-S1 discs had the largest flexion-extension range of motion (p<0.005) and L1-L2 discs the lowest flexion high flexibility zone size (p<0.013). No other strict cranial-caudal differences in kinematic outcomes were found. Low flexibility zone rotational stiffness increased with disc degeneration grade in extension, lateral bending and axial rotation (p<0.001). Trends towards higher hysteresis and lower range of motion with increased degeneration were observed in flexion-extension and lateral bending. Applied compressive preload increased flexion-extension hysteresis and augmented the effect of degeneration on hysteresis (p<0.0005). Female specimens had about one degree larger range of motion in all rotational modes, and higher flexion extension hysteresis (p=0.016). These results suggest that gender differences exist in lumbar spine kinematics. Additionally high disc loads, applied compressive preload or applied moment, are needed to kinematically distinguish discs with different levels of degeneration.Copyright © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

1776,"Feasibility and Safety of Ultrasonography Guidance and Flank Position during Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy. Purpose: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is generally performed using fluoroscopy, which is associated with exposure to radiation. Another drawback of fluoroscopic guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the prone position, which is not suitable for all patients. In this study we evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 603 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 50.9 +/- 13 years were included in this study from December 2010 to July 2016. Access to the collecting system and tract dilation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Perioperative data on the stone-free rate, operative time, length of stay and complication rates were recorded. Result(s): Successful access was achieved in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time was 56.6 +/- 6.5 minutes. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 529 patients (87.7%) and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications were noted in 17 (2.8%). Blood transfusion was necessary in 43 patients (7.1%). However, bleeding was self-limited in all cases and did not require angioembolization. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the largest series of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Unlike in other studies we used this procedure in all patients irrespective of stone burden, renal anomaly and body habitus. Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy has outcomes comparable to those of conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is not associated with radiation exposure. Furthermore, anesthesia while in the flank position might be less harmful in some patients, including those with obesity or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded

A single lateral locking plate and cables were used for osteosynthesis in all patients. Cerclage also was used to gain tight fixation depending on the fracture type. The rate and the time of fracture union, walking ability at final follow-up, the position of the fracture reduction at the time of surgery, and complications of surgery were investigated. Result(s): Patients achieved fracture union on average by 6.5 months after fixation. At mean follow-up of 14 months, 7 of 9 patients had recovered their pre-injury walking ability. Two patients still had a fracture gap of 4mm after fixation, one had stem subsidence of 5mm one month after fixation, and another had delayed-union. There were no serious complications such as infection or hardware failure. Conclusion(s): The outcome of osteosynthesis with locking plates and cables for PFFs was successful. The degree of reduction and strong fixation are essential factors for the treatment of periprosthetic femoral fractures.Copyright © 2016, Chiba Medical Society. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Measurements of skeletal 210Pb made in vivo allow the exposed individuals to become, in effect, their own 'samplers' and 'dosimeters' through the normal physical and physiological processes of inhalation, deposition, and retention. 210Pb measurements have been made on 40 subjects whose homes have above average levels of radon. These data are used to obtain their cumulative lung exposures, defined as RLM (Respiratory Level Months).

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective study was to analyze time course of pain relief by radiotherapy for cancer pain., METHODS: A total of 91 patients with painful bone metastases were treated by radiotherapy with a median total dose of 46 Gy. Pain of the irradiated site was assessed using a numerical rating scale (pain score: 0 to 10) once a week from the beginning of radiotherapy (day 1) for about 5 weeks., RESULTS: In time course analysis of the 91 cases, the mean (+/-SD) pain scores at day 5, day 12, day 19, day 26, day 33, and day 40 were 7.8 (+/-1.6), 5.3 (+/-2.5), 3.5 (+/-2.5), 2.4 (+/-2.5), 1.6 (+/-2.1), and 1.1 (+/-1.9), respectively, and mean pain score was significantly reduced with time from the start of radiotherapy (P<0.001: repeated measure ANOVA). Mean pain score was significantly reduced every week by d33 (P<0.05: d5 vs. d12, d12 vs. d19, d19 vs. d26, and d26 vs. d33).

The mean time to obtain complete pain relief (n=45) was 24 days. Doses of analgesics were reduced in 28/64 (44%) cases at the end of radiotherapy., DISCUSSION: Telling approximate time course of pain relief seems to reduce patients' anxiety, and knowing time course of pain relief seems to be useful to determine optimal dose of analgesics that changes according to the course.",Excluded
1140,"Swimming kinematics and respiratory behaviour of Xenopus laevis larvae raised in altered gravity. We examined the respiratory behaviours and swimming kinematics of Xenopus laevis tadpoles hatched in microgravity (Space Shuttle), simulated microgravity (clinostat) and hypergravity (3 g centrifuge). All observations were made in the normal 1 g environment. Previous research has shown that X. laevis raised in microgravity exhibit abnormalities in their lungs and vestibular system upon return to 1 g. The tadpoles raised in true microgravity exhibited a significantly lower tailbeat frequency than onboard 1 g centrifuge controls on the day of landing (day0), but this behaviour normalized within 9 days. The two groups did not differ significantly in buccal pumping rates. Altered buoyancy in the space-flight microgravity tadpoles was indicated by an increased swimming angle on the day after landing (day1). Tadpoles raised in simulated microgravity differed to a greater extent in swimming behaviours from their 1 g controls. The tadpoles raised in hypergravity showed no substantive effects on the development of swimming or respiratory behaviours, except swimming angle. Together, these results show that microgravity has a transient effect on the development of locomotion in X. laevis tadpoles, most notably on swimming angle, indicative of stunted lung development. On the basis of the behaviours we studied, there is no indication of neuromuscular retardation in amphibians associated with embryogenesis in microgravity.",Excluded

Background: We describe the clinical history, outcome, and toxicity of five patients with high-grade retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS) who were treated with neoadjuvant low-dose radiotherapy (RT) followed by resection with or without intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), followed by adjuvant RT. We aim to provide additional evidence for the various treatment options that exist for this rare tumor entity. Method(s): Most patients presented with mild abdominal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Additional imaging was done by sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). All patients were treated with neoadjuvant RT of 19.8Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions followed by resection and postoperative RT up to 45Gy with a median interval between resection and start of postoperative RT of 5 weeks. Two patients received additional IORT. Median follow-up was 61 months. Result(s): One patient developed a local recurrence that was diagnosed 30 months after the start of the first therapy. He was treated with a salvage resection and had no evidence of disease at the last follow-up. Another patient developed a right-sided RSTS on the contralateral side from the primary radiation field with pelvic bone infiltration 56 months after the start of RT. He was treated again by RT and resection and was without evidence of disease at last follow-up. Radiotherapy was well tolerated without major toxicity. Conclusion(s): The treatment of RSTS by low-dose neoadjuvant RT, resection with IORT and adjuvant RT seems to be a feasible and effective treatment approach. Further studies comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant RT are necessary to find the best treatment option.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

Advanced nodal disease associated with head and neck cancer warrants aggressive, often multi-modality therapy to maximize local-regional control. The expansion of a novel treatment paradigm developed by our institution includes the addition of a single-fraction of high dose spatially-fractionated radiation (GRID) to a conventional course of treatment. Between 1995 and 2002 a series of 27 patients (median age 65) with bulky N2-3 disease were treated. Median nodal tumor size was 7 cm. Two groups of patients were evaluated. Group 1 (N=14) patients received a median neck dose 69 Gy (range 54-79 Gy) plus GRID treatment. Group 2 (N=13) patients received a median neck dose of 59 Gy (range 54-72 Gy) plus GRID treatment followed by planned neck dissection. Patients were evaluated for local-regional control, pathological response, survival, and morbidity. Median time to follow-up for Group 1 was 10 months (range 3-44 months). Neck control was 93%. Disease specific survival was 50%. Morbidity was limited to soft-tissue related damage and was mild. Median time to follow-up for Group 2 was 38 months (range 5-116 months). Pathologic complete response rate was 85%. Overall neck control rate was 92%. Disease specific survival was 85%. Surgical morbidity was limited to three wound healing complications. GRID treatment may be safely added to conventional treatment management of locally advanced neck disease related to cancer with acceptable morbidity. It may improve pathologic complete response rates in those patients who undergo planned neck dissection, possibly leading to improved survival.

1967,"Myeloablative unrelated cord blood transplantation for acute leukemia patients between 50 and 55 years of age: Single institutional retrospective comparison with patients younger than 50 years of age. Increasing recipient age is a well-known risk factor for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and treatment-related mortality (TRM) and has a negative impact on allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Since the incidence of severe GVHD after cord blood transplantation (CBT) is lower than that after transplants using bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood grafts from adult cells, we should expect better outcomes from CBT in older patients. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of myeloablative unrelated CBT in patients aged between 50 and 55 years, we performed a retrospective comparison of 100 patients with acute leukemia who received cord blood grafts at our institution. Nineteen older patients (median age, 52; range, 50-55) and 81 younger patients (median, 36; range, 16-49) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen including 12 Gy of total body irradiation and chemotherapy. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine with (n = 96) or without (n = 4) methotrexate.

601,"Volume of high-dose regions and likelihood of locoregional control after perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy: do hotter implants work better?. PURPOSE: To determine whether perioperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy (PHDRB) implants with larger high-dose regions produce increased locoregional control., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients (n=166) enrolled in several PHDRB prospective studies conducted at the University of Navarre were analyzed. The PHDRB was given to total doses of 16Gy/4 b.i.d. or 24Gy/6 b.i.d. treatments for negative or close/positive margins along with 45Gy/25 Rx of external beam radiation therapy. The histogram-based generalized equivalent uniform dose (EUD) formulism was used to quantify and standardize the dose-volume histogram into 2-Gy equivalents. The region of interest analyzed included: tissue volume encompassed by the prescription isodose of 4Gy (TV100). Routine dose reporting parameters such as physical dose and single-point 2-Gy equivalent dose were used for reference., RESULTS: After a median followup of 7.4 years (range, 3-12+), 50 patients have failed, and 116 remain controlled at last followup. Overall, EUD was not different in the patients who failed compared with controls (89.1Gy vs. 86.5Gy; p=not significant). When patients were stratified by risk using the University of Navarre Predictive Model, very high-risk patients (i.e., tumors >=3cm resected with close <1mm/positive margins) had an improved locoregional control with higher EUD values (p=0.028). This effect was not observed in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk University of Navarre Predictive Model categories., CONCLUSIONS: In very high-risk patients, enlarged high-dose regions can produce a dose-response effect. Routine dose reporting methods such as physical dose and single-point 2-Gy equivalent dose may not show this effect, but it can be revealed by histogram-based EUD assessment.

2803,"Image quality and radiation dose of dual-energy CT of the head and neck compared with a standard 120-kVp acquisition. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: DECT offers additional image datasets with potential benefits, but its use for H&N imaging is not justified unless image quality is preserved without increased radiation dose. The aim of this work was to compare image quality and radiation dose between a DE-derived WA image dataset and a standard SECT acquisition of the H&N. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients underwent DECT of the H&N (tube voltages 80 and Sn140 kVp) and were compared with the last 32 patients who underwent standard SECT (120 kVp) on the same dual-source scanner. WA images from the 2 DE tubes were compared with images obtained with an SE mode. Radiation doses and attenuation measurements of the internal jugular vein, submandibular gland, and sternomastoid and tongue muscles were compared. Objective image noise was compared at 5 anatomic levels. Two blinded readers compared subjective image quality by using 5-point grading scales. RESULT(S): CTDIvol was 12% lower with DE than with SECT, a difference of 1.5 mGy, (P < .0001). Objective noise was not significantly different between DE and SECT at any of the anatomic levels (P > .05). No significant differences in attenuation measurements were observed between DE and SECT (P > .05). No significant differences in subjective image quality scores were observed between DE and SECT at any of the 5 anatomic levels (P > .05). CONCLUSION(S): DE-derived WA images of the H&N are equivalent to standard SE acquisitions and thus can be used for routine diagnostic purposes. Multiple additional image datasets can be obtained with no radiation dose penalty.",Excluded
1900,"Longstanding symptomatic choroidal hemangioma managed with limited PDT as initial or salvage therapy. Purpose: To describe the use of limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of symptomatic choroidal hemangiomas. Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma were treated with limited PDT 6 min following a 1-min infusion with verteporfin (6 mg/m2 body surface area), using a diode laser (692 nm) and a single spot large enough to cover only the most prominent part of the tumor. Exposure time was 166 s in the first three patients and 83 s in the last ten patients, resulting in a radiance exposure of respectively 100 and 50 J/cm2. Result(s): In all 11 not previously conventionally treated patients, visual acuity improved following PDT treatment. The two remaining patients with prior radiation treatment both reported widening of the visual field and sharper vision, but did not show an increase in ETDRS vision. In all but four patients the tumor became ultrasonographically undetectable by the first follow-up visit at 6 weeks, with only a slight irregularity at the level of the previous tumor remaining. In four patients the residual tumor was still detectable, and they received a second treatment, following which the tumor flattened completely. In all patients the retinal detachment disappeared. Conclusion(s): The present series demonstrates that even limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is an effective first-line treatment for choroidal hemangiomas.",Excluded
2941,"Identification of ureteral stones at reduced radiation exposure: a pilot study comparing conventional versus digital low-dosage linear slot scanning (Lodox R) radiography. PURPOSE: Digital low-dosage, linear slot scanning radiography (Lodox R) is an imaging modality that can emit down to one-tenth the radiation of conventional X-ray systems. We prospectively evaluated Lodox R as a diagnostic imaging modality in patients with ureterolithiasis., METHODS: Conventional kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) X-ray and Lodox R were performed in 41 patients presenting with acute flank pain due to unilateral ureteral stone confirmed by computed tomography. KUB X-ray and Lodox R images were then reviewed by four blinded readers (urology expert/resident, radiology expert/resident). Identification rates were compared using Pearson's Chi square test. The impact of different parameters on stone identification by Lodox R was evaluated using logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models. Inter-reader agreement was tested using Cohen's kappa coefficient., RESULTS: Median stone size was 5 mm (range 2-12), median stone density was 800 HU (range 200-1500). The identification rates of the urology expert were 68% for KUB X-ray and 90% for Lodox R (p = 0.014), and for all four readers 61% for KUB X-ray and 62% for Lodox R (p = 0.8). Radiation exposure for KUB X-ray and Lodox R was 0.45 mSv (SD +/- 0.64) and 0.027 mSv (SD +/- 0.038), respectively. Multivariable analyses showed an association between stone identification by Lodox R and stone size (p < 0.001), stone density (p = 0.005), lower body mass index (p = 0.005), and reader (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The high identification rates and low radiation doses of Lodox R make it a promising imaging modality for the diagnosis of ureteral stones.

2267,"Prognostic factors in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Introduction: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma has the highest metastatic potential of all head and neck cancers. The survival time of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma has improved significantly in the last decades due to the use of combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, as well as advances in radiotherapy techniques. However, appropriately 30% of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma suffer a poor prognosis, mainly due to distant metastasis. Objective(s): The study aimed to identify the survival and prognostic factors in metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Method(s): A retrospective analysis was conducted in patients treated for synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma or metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma for 14 years (2003-2016). Overall survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test for the whole population and both groups of patients. Multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox model; p-values < 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. Result(s): One hundred and twelve patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were included (51 patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and 61 patients with metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma). In the whole population, the median overall survival was 10 months (1-156 months). In the multivariate analysis, female gender, poor performance status (WHO > 1) and metachronous metastasis were independent prognostic factors. In the metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, the median overall survival was 13 months (1-156 months). In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic factors were non-oligometastatic disease, severe (G3-G4) chemotherapy toxicity and the lack of nasopharyngeal and metastatic site irradiation. In the metachronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, the median overall survival was 7 months (1-41 months). In multivariate analysis, the poor performance status (WHO > 1) was an independent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma prognostic factor. Conclusion(s): Oligometastatic patients with synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma had better survival. The locoregional treatment of primitive nasopharyngeal carcinoma improved survival in patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma who responded to induction chemotherapy. Local irradiation of metastatic sites improved survival of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients. Grade 3 or 4 chemotherapy toxicity altered survival among patients with synchronous metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.Copyright © 2020 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial",Excluded
2017,"Analysis of the relationship between tumor dose inhomogeneity and local control in patients with skull base chordoma. PURPOSE: When irradiating a tumor that abuts or displaces any normal structures, the dose constraints to those structures (if lower than the prescribed dose) may cause dose inhomogeneity in the tumor volume at the tumor-critical structure interface. The low-dose region in the tumor volume may be one of the reasons for local failure. The aim of this study is to quantitate the effect of tumor dose inhomogeneity on local control and recurrence-free survival in patients with skull base chordoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: 132 patients with skull base chordoma were treated with combined photon and proton irradiation between 1978 and 1993. This study reviews 115 patients whose dose-volume data and follow-up data are available. The prescribed doses ranged from 66.6 Cobalt-Gray-Equivalent (CGE) to 79.2 CGE (median of 68.9 CGE). The dose to the optic structures (optic nerves and chiasm), the brain stem surface, and the brain stem center was limited to 60, 64, and 53 CGE, respectively. We used the dose-volume histogram data derived with the three-dimensional treatment planning system to evaluate several dose-volume parameters including the Equivalent Uniform Dose (EUD). We also analyzed several other patient and treatment factors in relation to local control and recurrence-free survival., RESULTS: Local failure developed in 42 of 115 patients, with the actuarial local control rates at 5 and 10 years being 59% and 44%. Gender was a significant predictor for local control with the prognosis in males being significantly better than that in females (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 2.3). In a Cox univariate analysis, with stratification by gender, the significant predictors for local control (at the probability level of 0.05) were EUD, the target volume, the minimum dose, and the D5cc dose. The prescribed dose, histology, age, the maximum dose, the mean dose, the median dose, the D90% dose, and the overall treatment time were not significant factors. In a Cox multivariate analysis, the models including gender and EUD, or gender and the target volume, or gender and the minimum target dose were significant. The more biologically meaningful of these models is that of gender and EUD., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the probability of recurrence of skull base chordomas depends on gender, target volume, and the level of target dose inhomogeneity. EUD was shown to be a useful parameter to evaluate dose distribution for the target volume.",Excluded
3053,"Stress echocardiography in women. The diagnosis of coronary heart disease in women has been thought to be more difficult than in men, owing to the overall lower prevalence and severity of disease in women, as well as more subtle clinical presentations. Exercise electrocardiography is associated with a high rate of false-positive results. In contrast, exercise and pharmacologic stress echocardiography have been shown to have high sensitivity, specificity, and prognostic value in women, comparable to that obtained in a male population. Although exercise thallium provides high diagnostic accuracy, due to its cost, availability, and radiation exposure, it may not be the ideal initial test in women. Thus, compared with other modalities, the advantages of stress echocardiography include its lower cost, availability, and high diagnostic accuracy. In the evaluation of women with chest pain, the initial step should involve clinical stratification into low, moderate, or high-probability groups based on symptoms, age, and cardiovascular risk factors. In women with atypical chest pain and a low probability of coronary heart disease, further testing should be avoided because any positive result is likely to be falsely positive. In those women with a moderate likelihood of disease, the most efficient and cost-effective strategy includes stress echocardiography as the initial test. This approach avoids the high rate of false-positive results with subsequent unnecessary angiography generated by exercise electrocardiography, as well as minimizing false-negative results, which would lead to delays and potential increase in morbidity and mortality from untreated coronary heart disease. The optimal strategy for women at high clinical risk may be either exercise echocardiography or cardiac catheterization as the initial test. Although the diagnosis of CAD in women is different than in men, it is not necessarily more difficult. Astute clinical evaluation, in conjunction with judicious use of diagnostic testing, yields excellent results.",Excluded
593,"Carcinoma of the larynx treated with hypofractionated radiation and hyperbaric oxygen: Long-term tumor control and complications. Purpose: To evaluate the long-term outcome with respect to local control, survival, and complications in a cohort of patients with locally advanced laryngeal carcinoma treated with hypofractionated radiation and hyperbaric oxygen at 4 atmospheres of pressure (HBO-4). Methods and Materials: Between January 1970 and August 1982, 45 patients with locally advanced carcinoma of the larynx were treated with primary radiation using a unique hypofractionated schedule of 2 fractions of 11 Gy separated by 21 days, with concomitant HBO-4 during each radiotherapy session. To avoid seizures, discomfort and other complications of HBO-4, each session was performed under general anesthesia. All patients had pathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic (23) or supraglottic larynx (22) and were staged as follows: T2-5, T3-24, T-4-16; N0-26, N1-4, N2-13, N3-1. Patients were treated with opposed lateral wedged fields of 4-6MV photons, with a median field size of 5.5 x 9.75 to a total median dose of 22.5 Gy. Result(s): As of February 1998, follow-up was complete on all but one patient, who relocated to another country after 8 years. Complete clinical responses were observed in 39 (87%) of the cases. The 10-year local control rate for all 45 patients was 58%, and local control for the complete responders was 69%. Three patients underwent laryngectomy for complications and were found to have no pathological evidence of disease in the laryngectomy specimen. The 10-year survival of the overall population was 27%. The 10-year voice preservation rate for the the 39 complete responders was 55%. Acute mucosal and skin reactions were modest and acceptable. Significant late complications occurred in 14 patients consisting of severe fibrosis, necrosis, pharyngeal fistula, with 3 patients requiring laryngectomy for complications. The actuarial rate of severe complications at 5 years was 42%. Conclusion(s): The response rate and long-term tumor control rate obtained with this treatment program were comparable to more protracted radiation schedules with or without systemic chemotherapy. The complication rate was high resulting in an adverse therapeutic ratio. The radiobiologic interpretation of this clinical data, and implications for hypoxia directed therapy, are discussed.",Excluded

The power density in the area within 300 m from the base station exceeded the permissive limits and was significantly (p = 0.000) higher compared to the area from where control samples were collected. The study participants comprised 63 persons with residences near a mobile phone tower, and 28 healthy controls matched for gender, age, alcohol drinking and occupational sub-groups. Genetic damage parameters of DNA migration length, damage frequency (DF) and damage index were significantly (p = 0.000) elevated in the sample group compared to respective values in healthy controls. The female residents (n = 25) of the sample group had significantly (p = 0.004) elevated DF than the male residents (n = 38).

2692,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies. Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

1715,"Effects of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser irradiation on neural impulse propagation: I. Spinal cord. We studied the effect of irradiation with Q-switched Nd:YAG laser light (1064 nm) on spinal cord dorsal column and dorsolateral white matter in anesthetized rats. To evoke a synchronous sensory input, the sciatic nerve was stimulated electrically and the resulting evoked spinal cord potential (SCP) recorded from the dorsal columns of the ipsilateral side. The waveshape of the SCP showed three components: an early positive peak (P1), representing the responses of the most rapidly conducting fibers, followed by two negative peaks (N1 and N2), which are mainly due to synaptic effects of the volley on dorsal horn cells located in dorsal grey matter. Laser irradiation at 50 mJ/pulse and above resulted in severe reduction in the amplitudes of N1 and N2. In contrast, there was either no reduction at all or only a slight decrease in the amplitude of P1. The selective loss of the synaptic field might be mediated by impairment of synaptic transmission or by loss of high threshold fiber input to dorsal horn neurones. In either event it is likely that the mechanism of the differential effects of laser irradiation on the components of the electrically evoked SCP is at least in part photothermally mediated, since intracord temperatures during laser application greatly exceeded the physiological range.",Excluded
2306,"Endovascular Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Obstruction: Comparison of Efficacy Between Stent Alone and Stent Combined With Linear Radioactive Seeds Strand. Objectives: To investigate the safety and efficacy of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds to treat malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data of 57 patients with malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Nineteen patients underwent the placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds (group A), and 38 patients underwent the placement of a bare stent (group B). The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups of patients: symptom relief rate, duration of venous patency, survival time, quality of life, and adverse events. Result(s): A total of 34 stents and 527 seeds were implanted in group A, while a total of 57 stents were implanted in group B. The surgery success rate was 96.5%, and no serious complication related to the surgery was reported. Symptoms of venous obstruction improved significantly after surgery. The score of group A decreased from 14.74 +/- 0.562 points before surgery to 2.79 +/- 1.357 points after surgery(P <.001), and the score of group B decreased from 13.79 +/- 1.398 points before surgery to 5.55 +/- 3.674 points after surgery (P <.001). The patency rate of group A was significantly higher than that of group B at 1 to 6 months after surgery (100%, 84.2%, 68.4%, 63.2%, 36.8%, 21.1% vs 68.4%, 23.7%, 18.4%, 7.9%, 5.3%, 2.6%, respectively; P <.05). Before treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score between the groups (P =.791). After 1 to 6 months of treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in group A than in group B (P =.013). The median patency duration in groups A and B was 125 days (95% CI: 80.018-169.982) and 35 days (95% CI: 20.501-49.499), respectively (P <.001). The median survival time of group A was 155 days (95% CI: 110.406-199.594), and that of group B was 98 days (95% CI: 55.712-140.288; P =.325). Multivariate analysis showed that the implantation of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds and the KPS score (>=80 points) were independent factors of long-term patency after stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds is a safe and effective treatment for venous obstruction caused by malignant tumors. This treatment provides prolonged patency compared with the placement of bare stent, and while it does not significantly improve the survival time of patients, it can improve their quality of life.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

In a retrospective, non-randomized study, we reviewed our experience with the operative treatment of olecranon fractures to find out which factors correlate with subjective complaints and functional outcome. A total of 95 consecutive olecranon fractures were operatively treated in our level I trauma institution between 1 March 1992 and 1 March 2000. Medical records and X-rays of all patients were evaluated. Three patients died, 23 were lost to follow-up. Fifty-eight of 69 available patients (84.0%) were reviewed clinically and/or radiologically after a mean time of 36 months. Fracture type, fracture classification, associated lesions, technical correctness of osteosynthesis, age and comorbidity were analysed. Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3305,"A new grading system for ototoxicity in adults. Objective: This study aimed to propose an ototoxicity grading system sensitive to the effect of ototoxicity on specific daily life situations like speech intelligibility and the perception of ultra-high sounds and to test its feasibility compared to current criteria. Method(s): Pure tone averages (PTAs) for speech perception (1-2-4 kHz) and ultra-high frequencies (8-10-12.5 kHz) were incorporated. Threshold shift and hearing level posttreatment were taken into account. Criteria were tested on head and neck cancer patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy ([C]RT) and compared with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4) and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria (ASHA). Result(s): Grades 1 and 2 were based on threshold shifts from baseline (in dB) and subjective complaints. Grades 3 and 4 were defined as treatment-induced hearing loss of >= 35 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz and >= 70 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz, respectively. In high-dose cisplatin CRT incidences by the new criteria, CTCAEv4 and ASHA were comparable (78%-88%). In RT and low-dose cisplatin CRT, incidences were 36% to 39% in the new criteria versus 22% to 53% in CTCAEv4 and ASHA. Conclusion(s): The new criteria show an increased sensitivity to ototoxicity compared to CTCAEv4 and ASHA and provide insight into the effect of hearing loss on certain daily life situations. The new grading system seems feasible for clinic and research purposes.Copyright © 2014 The Author(s).",Excluded

312,"Barrier requirements as the evolutionary Driver"" of epidermal pigmentation in humans"". Current explanations for the development of epidermal pigmentation during human evolution are not tenable as stand-alone hypotheses. Accordingly, we assessed instead whether xeric- and UV-B-induced stress to the epidermal permeability barrier, critical to survival in a terrestrial environment, could have driven"" the development of epidermal pigmentation. (1) Megadroughts prevailed in central Africa when hominids expanded into open savannahs [=1.5-0.8 million years ago], resulting in sustained exposure to both extreme aridity and erythemogenic UV-B, correlating with genetic evidence that pigment developed =1.2 million years ago. (2) Pigmented skin is endowed with enhanced permeability barrier function, stratum corneum integrity/cohesion, and a reduced susceptibility to infections. The enhanced function of pigmented skin can be attributed to the lower pH of the outer epidermis, likely due to the persistence of (more-acidic) melanosomes into the outer epidermis, as well as the conservation of genes associated with eumelanin synthesis and melanosome acidification (e.g., TYR, OCA2 [p protein], SLC24A5, SLC45A2, MATP) in pigmented populations. Five keratinocyte-derived signals (stem cell factor)KIT; FOXn1)FGF2; IL-1alpha , NGF, and p53) are potential candidates to have stimulated the sequential development of epidermal pigmentation in response to stress to the barrier. We summarize evidence here that epidermal interfollicular pigmentation in early hominids likely evolved in response to stress to the permeability barrier. Am. J. Hum.

3126,"Comparative evaluation of radiation therapy techniques for mediastinum irradiation in lymphoma patients using IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT. Introduction: Radiation therapy is effective in treating mediastinal lymphomas, but the question of its long-term radiation effects, such as induced breast cancer, lung cancer, and heart disease, has been increasingly raised in recent years. The aim of our work was to compare the radiation doses that receive heart, lungs, and mammary glands (MG) during irradiation of mediastinal lymphomas by 3 different techniques: IMRT, B-VMAT, 3DCRT. Method(s): A radiation therapy plan was calculated for each of the indicated techniques for 7 mediastinal lymphoma patients. Photon energy: 6 MV, target dose: 30 Gy/15 fractions, planned target volume (PTV) coverage: 98% PTV covered by at least 95% isodose. IMRT and B-VMAT plans were calculated by inverse planning, and 3DCRT by direct planning using the Monte Carlo algorithm. Each IMRT plan consists of 7 coplanar fields almost equally spaced around a patient, using the ability not to pass through MG. B-VMAT plan is a composition of 3 non-coplanar VMAT arcs, couch 0degree G330degree/G30degree, couch 0degree G150degree/G180degree+G181degree/G210degree and couch 270degree G330degree/G30degree. 3DCRT plan is a couple of AP-PA fields with an addition of small portion of posterior oblique fields that lead to maximum dose outside PTV avoidance without adding any significant dose to lungs. An extra sub-volume ""heart inside PTV"" was created for inverse optimization in order to keep its dose theraputical and avoid any possible maximum inside the heart. Result(s): With a probability of p < 0.05, the following parameters were estimated. Average volumes of PTV (620 +/- 170) cc, MG (710 +/- 660) cc, total lung (2950+/-420) cc and heart (590 +/- 90) cc. Dose-Volume relations are given in following table Conclusion(s): With the stated above PTV coverage, the IMRT technique can significantly increase the conformity index of the plan and lead to the lowest dose to the heart in all studied parameters, but showed the highest dose to the lungs-both mean dose and V20. The B-VMAT technique can significantly reduce V4 MG while maintaining minimum V25 heart and V20 lungs. At the same time, despite the low mean dose to the heart-inside-PTV, the mean dose to the whole heart with this technique is higher compared to the IMRT technique due to the increase in V5 heart. The standard 3DCRT technique achieves the lowest average dose to the lungs, but has not shown any advantages in the rest of considered critical organs. The scatter of the data is due to the large variability of the physiological parameters of the patients, in order to specify the obtained data the study is proceeded. .",Excluded
2338,"High ambient solar UV correlates with greater beta HPV seropositivity in New South Wales, Australia. Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is highly prevalent worldwide and may have a role, with sun exposure, in causing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Little is known about the relationship of UV exposure and seroprevalence of cutaneous HPVs in the general population. Method(s): Using multiplex serology, we estimated the seroprevalence of 23 beta and 7 gamma HPVs and 7 other antigens (mu HPV1, HPV63, nu HPV41, alpha HPV16; polyomaviruses HPyV7 and MCV; p53) in a population-based sample of 1,161 Australian 45 and Up Study participants with valid data from blood specimens collected from 2010 to 2012. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association of each antigen with residential ambient solar UV and other UV-related variables. Result(s): Seropositivity for at least one beta or gamma HPV was high at 88% (beta HPVs 74%, gamma HPVs 70%), and less in women than men [e.g., PR beta-2 HPV38 1/4 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.87; any gamma 1/4 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97]. A high ambient UV level in the 10 years before study enrollment was associated with elevated seroprevalence for genus beta (PRtertile3vs1 any beta 1/4 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28), and beta-1 to beta-3 species, but not for gamma HPVs. Other UV-related measures had less or no evidence of an association. Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence of cutaneous beta HPVs is higher with higher ambient UV exposure in the past 10 years. Impact: The observed association between ambient UV in the past 10 years and cutaneous HPVs supports further study of the possible joint role of solar UV and HPV in causing skin cancer.Copyright ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded

2386,"A combination therapy of ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Aim: To summarize the effects of laparoscopic ethanol injection and radiofrequency ablation (L-EI-RFA), thoracoscopic (T-EI-RFA) and open-surgery assisted EI-RFA (O-EI-RFA) under general anesthesia for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Method(s): Time-lag performance of RFA after ethanol injection (Time-lag PEI-RFA) was performed in all cases. The volume of coagulated necrosis and the applied energy for total and per unit volume coagulated necrosis were examined in the groups treated under general (group G) or local anesthesia (group L). Result(s): The results showed that the total applied energy and the applied energy per unit volume of whole and marginal, coagulated necrosis were significantly larger in group G than those in the group L, resulting in a larger volume of coagulated necrosis in the group G. The rate of local tumor recurrence within one year was extremely low in group G. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that EI-RFA, under general anesthesia, may be effective for the treatment of HCC because a larger quantity of ethanol and energy could be applied during treatment under pain-free condition for the patients. © 2008 WJG.

The frequency of X-ray induced X-chromosome breaks has been studied in females of the line rad (2) 201G1 hypersensitive to radiation and in females of the control line selected from the same population. The frequency of X-chromosome breaks was judged based on the frequency of X0 males occurrence. Synergism of the effects of X-rays (at doses 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 kr) and of hyperthermia (+37 degrees C, 5.5 hours) applied after irradiation served as an indirect evidence for the functioning of DNA repair systems. It is demonstrated that radiosensitivity of mature oocytes of the lines compared was equal and that hyperthermia applied after irradiation increased the latter effect in both lines. Young oocytes of the control line were radioresistant, and hyperthermia applied after irradiation enhanced its effect. Opposite to them, young oocytes of the rad line females were radiosensitive. They did not differ from mature oocytes in the frequency of X-chromosome losses. Synergism of the two factors (irradiation and hyperthermia) was not registered in young oocytes. On the basis of the results obtained, it may be concluded that radiosensitivity of young oocytes in the hypersensitive line is conditioned by the failure of DNA repair systems and that the rad (2) 201G1 gene may be considered, in relation to the genes controlling DNA repair, as a suppressor functioning selectively at a certain stage of oogenesis.",Excluded
2382,"Targeted disruption of NBS1 reveals its roles in mouse development and DNA repair. Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease that shares some common defects with ataxia-telangiectasia. The gene product mutated in NBS, named NBS1, is a component of the Mre11 complex that is involved in DNA strand-break repair. To elucidate the physiological roles of NBS1, we disrupted the N-terminal exons of the NBS1 gene in mice. NBS1(m/m) mice are viable, growth retarded and hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). NBS1(m/m) mice exhibit multiple lymphoid developmental defects, and rapidly develop thymic lymphoma. In addition, female NBS1(m/m) mice are sterile due to oogenesis failure. NBS1(m/m) cells are impaired in cellular responses to IR and defective in cellular proliferation. Most systematic and cellular defects identified in NBS1(m/m) mice recapitulate those in NBS patients, and are essentially identical to those observed in Atm(-/-) mice. In contrast to Atm(-/-) mice, spermatogenesis is normal in NBS1(m/m) mice, indicating that distinct roles of ATM have differential requirement for NBS1 activity. Thus, NBS1 and ATM have overlapping and distinct functions in animal development and DNA repair.",Excluded
901,"Dose reduction in standard head CT: First results from a new scanner using iterative reconstruction and a new detector type in comparison with two previous generations of multi-slice CT. Purpose: Computed tomography (CT) accounts for more than half of the total radiation exposure from medical procedures, which makes dose reduction in CT an effective means of reducing radiation exposure. We analysed the dose reduction that can be achieved with a new CT scanner [Somatom Edge (E)] that incorporates new developments in hardware (detector) and software (iterative reconstruction). Method(s): We compared weighted volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) and dose length product (DLP) values of 25 consecutive patients studied with non-enhanced standard brain CT with the new scanner and with two previous models each, a 64-slice 64-row multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanner with 64 rows (S64) and a 16-slice 16-row MDCT scanner with 16 rows (S16). We analysed signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios in images from the three scanners and performed a quality rating by three neuroradiologists to analyse whether dose reduction techniques still yield sufficient diagnostic quality. Result(s): CTDI Vol of scanner E was 41.5 and 36.4 % less than the values of scanners S16 and S64, respectively; the DLP values were 40 and 38.3 % less. All differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were best in S64; these differences also reached statistical significance. Image analysis, however, showed non- inferiority"" of scanner E regarding image quality. Conclusion(s): The first experience with the new scanner shows that new dose reduction techniques allow for up to 40 % dose reduction while still maintaining image quality at a diagnostically usable level. © 2013 The Author(s).""",Excluded
182,"Improved visualization of the urinary tract in multidetector CT urography (MDCTU): analysis of individual acquisition delay and opacification using furosemide and low-dose test images. PURPOSE: To retrospectively analyze the reliability of opacification and image quality of a modified MDCTU examination protocol using furosemide and an individual acquisition delay by low-dose test images, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Excretory phase images obtained from 4-row and 16-row MSCTU examinations in 103 patients (69 men, 34 women) were independently reviewed by two radiologists. MDCTUs were performed by using a low-dose furosemide iv injection. No fixed delay for urographic image acquisition was applied. Urographic timing was individually adjusted by performing low-dose test images of the distal ureters to display their current opacification. Image analysis included grading of opacification and image quality of the segmented collecting system. Average urographic delay was calculated. Stratified comparisons of mean scores were assessed. Interobserver kappa values were calculated., RESULTS: Calculated median scan delay for patients with normal creatine levels (n = 92) was 420 sec (mean 453 sec; SD, 121 sec). The median number of acquired test images was 2 (range 1-6 images). The analysis of opacification demonstrated that 97% of the ICS, 89% of the proximal, 86% of the middle, and 81% of the distal ureter segments showed opacification greater than 90%. 7.8% of the distal ureteral segments could not be visualized. Statistics did not show significant differences of opacification between proximal, middle, and distal ureteral segments (P > 0.05). Overall image quality of MSCTU showed to be high when latest test images indicated homogeneous bilateral contrasted ureters (Pearson correlation coefficient r= 0.81). Interobserver kappa values were 0.8 and 0.78., CONCLUSION: Furosemide and scan delay timing by means of test images for MDCTU proved to be a reliable procedure to reach improved opacification of the upper urinary tract.

(1) Background: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of an augmented reality navigation system (SIRIO) for percutaneous biopsies and ablative treatments on bone lesions, compared to a standard CT-guided technique. (2) Methods: Bioptic and ablative procedures on bone lesions were retrospectively analyzed. All procedures were divided into SIRIO and Non-SIRIO groups and in <2 cm and >2 cm groups. Number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose were reported for each group. Diagnostic accuracy was obtained for bioptic procedures. (3) Results: One-hundred-ninety-three procedures were evaluated: 142 biopsies and 51 ablations. Seventy-four biopsy procedures were performed using SIRIO and 68 under standard CT-guidance; 27 ablative procedures were performed using SIRIO and 24 under standard CT-guidance. A statistically significant reduction in the number of CT-scans, procedural time and radiation dose was observed for percutaneous procedures performed using SIRIO, in both <2 cm and >2 cm groups. The greatest difference in all variables examined was found for procedures performed on lesions <2 cm. Higher diagnostic accuracy was found for all SIRIO-assisted biopsies. No major or minor complications occurred in any procedures. (4) Conclusion(s): The use of SIRIO significantly reduces the number of CT-scans, procedural time and patient's radiation dose in CT-guided percutaneous bone procedures, particularly for lesions <2 cm.

3090,"Implications for preserving neural stem cells in whole brain radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation: A review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients. This study delineated the incidence of metastatic involvement of neural stem cell (NSC) regions and further aimed to explore the feasibility of selectively sparing the NSC compartments during whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). A total of 2270 intracranial metastases in 488 patients were identified. Lesions were classified according to locations, including lesions in the NSC compartments (subventricular zone, SVZ, or hippocampus) and those in the rest of the brain/brainstem. The incidence of involvement of NSC regions was compared between oligometastatic patients (those with 14 lesions) and non-oligometastatic patients (those with 5 or more lesions) using a chi-square test. The volume of the NSC regions accounted for 2.23% of the whole brain, and the overall rate of metastatic lesions in NSC regions was 1.1% in 2270 metastases (25/2270), and 4.7% in 488 patients (23/488). Of the NSC region metastases, 7 (0.3%) involved the hippocampus and 18 (0.8%) occurred in the SVZ. Among the 7 hippocampal metastases identified in this study, 1/7 (14.3%) were found in oligometastatic patients, while 6/7 (85.7%) metastases were in non-oligometastatic patients. For metastases in the SVZ, all lesions occurred in non-oligometastatic patients with none in oligometastatic patients. Metastatic involvement of the NSC compartments was significantly lower in oligometastatic patients (0.15%, 1/670) than in non-oligometastatic patients (1.5%, 24/1600) (P < 0.001). Our retrospective review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients is that the volume of the compartments of NSC regions was 2.23% relative to the whole brain, but the incidence of involvement of the NSC compartments was 1.1%, and the vast majority of NSC lesions were found in nonoligometastatic patients. We believe our data supports selective reduction of doses for these aforementioned structures, when treating oligometastatic patients with WBRT and locally advanced-stage small-cell lung cancer patients with PCI. © The Author 2012.

1297,"Physiological reconstruction of the spine using dorsal correction spondylodesis in Scheuermann's disease - A retrospective analysis of 73 prospectively recorded cases. Introduction: Posterior spinal fusion (PSF) and correction is the most frequently performed surgery in Scheuermann-associated hyperkyphosis. The aim of the study was to assess the extent of kyphosis correction, complications and clinical outcome after PSF. Material/Methods: Between 2014 and 2018, 73 patients with Scheuermann associated hyperkyphosis underwent surgery, were prospectively recorded and retrospectively analyzed. X-rays of the whole spine were analyzed pre- and postoperative as well as after 6, 12 and 24 months. Sagittal and coronary Cobb angles, pelvic parameters and sagittal profile were evaluated using a web-based analysis tool. Operation duration, complications, and blood loss were compared. Postoperatively, the clinical outcome was determined using standardized questionnaires (SRS22, EQ 5D) after 3, 12 and 24 months. Result(s): Thoracic structural kyphosis (UEV-LEV) was preoperatively measured with 75.11degree with a correction to 48.54degree (p<0.001). The Stagnara angles had an extent of 68.87degree with a correction to 38.68degree (p<0.001). Compensatory lumbar lordosis (LL) showed a correction from 68.24degree to 46.70degree (p<0.001). Using the highly negative pelvic incidence (PI) - LL mismatch (PI-LL pre-OP - 23.6 to PI-LL post-OP -1.3; p<0.001) we demonstrated significant compensatory hyperlordosis pre-OP with good spontaneous correction post-OP. The number of fused segments (11.2) correlated significantly with the degree of kyphosis (p<0.005) and kyphosis correction (p<0.001). The pelvic parameters (PI, pelvic tilt, sacral slope) were physiologically preoperatively and without changes in the follow-up X-rays. The most frequently uppermost and lowest instrumented vertebra was T2 (33 patients, 45.2%) and L3 (29 patients, 39.7%), respectively. Number of fused segments correlated significantly with surgery duration (mean 263.73 min, p=0.012) and blood loss (mean 750.56 ml, p=0.016). The initial degree of kyphosis showed significant correlation with the SRS mental health subscore(p=0.043). The degree of kyphosis had no influence on the other subscores and on the total SRS 22. Furthermore, the clinical outcome showed a gradual and significant improvement of SRS 22 and EQ 5D after 3 and 12 months. Postoperatively we recorded the following complications: neurological complication without neurological deficit (3.2%), implant-associated complication (6.3%) and wound healing issues (3.2%). Discussion(s): Using PSF we corrected the thoracic hyperkyphosis of M. Scheuermann from 75degree to 48degree and the lumbar hyperlordosis from 68degree to 47degree. We could achieve an almost physiological reconstruction of the sagittal alignment. The first clinical followup results were convincing with a significant improvement of SRS 22 and the EQ 5D already after 3 months. Complication rates were moderate (14.2%) and the risk of proximal junctional kyphosis with sufficiently long instrumentation after PSF alone is rare with 1.6% of cases.",Excluded

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the number of brain lesions for which stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was performed on the dose volume relationships in normal brain., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain tissue was segmented using the patient's pre-SRS MRI. For each plan, the following data points were recorded: total brain volume, number of lesions treated, volume of brain receiving 8 Gy (V8), V10, V12, and V15., RESULTS: A total of 225 Gamma Knife R treatments were included in this retrospective analysis. The number of lesions treated ranged from 1 to 29. The isodose for prescription ranged from 40 to 95% (mean 55%). The mean prescription dose to tumor edge was 18 Gy. The mean coverage, selectivity, conformity, and gradient index were 97.5%, 0.63, 0.56, and 3.5, respectively. The mean V12 was 9.5 cm3 (ranging from 0.5 to 59.29). There was no correlation between the number of lesions and brain V8, V12, V10, or V15. There was a direct and statistically significant relationship between the brain volume treated (V8, V10, V12, and V15) and total volume of tumors treated (p < 0.001). In our study, the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3., CONCLUSIONS: The number of metastatic brain lesions treated bears no significant relationship to total brain tissue volume treated when using SRS. The fact that the integral dose to the brain exceeded 3 J when the total tumor volume exceeded 25 cm3 is useful for establishing guidelines. Although standard practice has favored using whole brain radiation therapy in patients with more than 4 lesions, a significant amount of normal brain tissue may be spared by treating these patients with SRS. SRS should be carefully considered in patients with multiple brain lesions, with the emphasis on total brain volume involved rather than the number of lesions to be treated. Copyright © 2017 S.

1222,"Vitamin D improves sunburns by increasing autophagy in M2 macrophages. Cutaneous inflammation from UV radiation exposure causes epidermal damage, cellular infiltration, and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators that exacerbate tissue destruction. Recovery is mediated chiefly by anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages that suppress inflammation and augment epidermal regeneration. Vitamin D enables anti-inflammation to promote tissue repair in response to injury. Since vitamin D enhances cellular macroautophagy/autophagy, we investigated the role of autophagy in vitamin D protection of UV-mediated sunburn and inflammation. Using a UV-mediated acute skin injury mouse model, we demonstrate that a single dose of vitamin D resolves injury with sustained inhibition of inflammatory cytokines associated with enhanced autophagy in myeloid anti-inflammatory M2 macs. Increased MAP1LC3B/LC3 expression corroborated with complete autolysosome formation detected by electron microscopy and correlated with degradation of SQSTM1/p62 in the skin following vitamin D treatment. Specifically, pharmacological inhibition of autophagy increased UV-induced apoptosis, suppressed M2 macs recruitment, and prevented vitamin D downregulation of Tnf and Mmp9 in the skin. Furthermore, selective deletion of autophagy in myeloid cells of atg7 cKO mice abrogated vitamin D-mediated protection and recapitulated UV-induced inflammation. Mechanistically, vitamin D signaling activated M2-autophagy regulators Klf4, Pparg, and Arg1. Lastly, analysis of UV-exposed human skin biopsies detected a similar increase in macrophage autophagy following vitamin D intervention, identifying an essential role for autophagy in vitamin D-mediated protection of skin from UV damage.

161,"Electromagnetic navigation diagnostic bronchoscopy in peripheral lung lesions. BACKGROUND: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) with biopsy under fluoroscopic guidance has enhanced the yield of flexible bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. However, the accuracy of ENB navigation suggests that the addition of fluoroscopy is redundant., OBJECTIVES: Data were prospectively collected to determine the yield of ENB without fluoroscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions., METHOD: ENB was performed via flexible bronchoscopy (superDimension/Bronchus system; superDimension Inc; Plymouth, MN). Biopsy specimens were obtained through the extended working channel after navigation. Fluoroscopy was not utilized, but post-transbronchial biopsy chest radiographs were obtained to exclude pneumothorax. The primary end point was diagnostic yield, and the secondary end points were navigation accuracy, procedure duration, and safety. Analysis by lobar distribution was also performed to assess performance in different lobes of the lung., RESULTS: Ninety-two peripheral lung lesions were biopsied in the 89 subjects. The diagnostic yield of ENB was 67%, which was independent of lesion size. Total procedure time ranged from 16.3 to 45.0 min (mean [+/- SD] procedure time, 26.9 +/- 6.5 min). The mean navigation error was 9 +/- 6 mm (range, 1 to 31 mm). There were two incidences of pneumothorax for which no intervention was required. When analyzed by lobar distribution, there was a trend toward a higher ENB yield in diagnosing lesions in the right middle lobe (88%)., CONCLUSIONS: ENB can be used as a stand-alone bronchoscopic technique without compromising diagnostic yield or increasing the risk of pneumothorax. This may result in sizable timesaving and avoids radiation exposure.",Excluded

Background: The incidence of radionecrosis after radiosurgery is 5-20%. That radionecrosis after radiosurgery may be confused with a malignant tumor is a known phenomenon and problem. Method(s): Three similarly treated patients with cAVM, 1 patient with symptomatic radionecrosis and 2 patients with normal post-radiation MRI changes, were selected and studied in detail with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). 2 cAVM were located in eloquent locations and were classified as Spetzler-Martin grade (SM) III such that interdisciplinary radiosurgery was recommended; a third patient with a left frontal SM II cAVM refused surgery. 1 patient was male, and 2 were female. The patient's ages ranged from 38 to 62 years (median, 39 years). The nidus volume (= planning target volume = PTV) ranged from 2.75 to 6.89 ccm (median, 6.41 ccm). The single dose was 20 Gy at the isocenter of the PTV encompassing the 80 - 90% isodose. The median follow-up period was 20 months (range, 16 - 84 months). Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for adverse events version 3.0. Result(s): No patient suffered a bleeding from cAVM during the study period. A complete nidus occlusion was shown in all patients with time-resolved MRA. All patients showed radiogenic MRI changes, 1 patient showed excessive radionecrosis. This patient was oligosymptomatic and under temporary corticoid therapy symptoms resolved completely.Following patterns associated with radionecrosis in the MRS studies were identified in our collective:. * 2D spectroscopic imaging (2D-SI) revealed much lower concentrations of metabolites in the lesion as compared to contralateral healthy tissue in all patients.* Whereas regions with regular post-radiosurgery effects showed almost normal levels of Cho and a Cho/Cr ratio < 2.0, regions with radionecrosis were characterized by increased lipid levels and a Cho/Cr ratio > 2.0 in conjunction with decreased absolute levels of all metabolites, especially of Cr and NAA. Conclusion(s): MRS is an increasingly valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of radiation reactions. Specific patterns of MRS spectra in radionecrosis were identified; in synopsis with clinical parameters, these changes have to be taken into account to avoid misdiagnosis. © 2013 Bostrom et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

The model considers reproduction, removal by predation, natural death, fishing, radiation and migration. Non-stochastic effects of chronic low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation are modelled with emphasis on (99)Tc, using three endpoints: repairable radiation damage, impairment of reproductive ability and, at higher dose rates, mortality. An allometric approach for the calculation of LD(50/30) as a function of the mass of each life stage is used in model calibration. The model predicts that at a dose rate of 1 Gy day(-1), lobster population reproduction and survival become severely compromised, leading eventually to population extinction. At 0.01 Gy day(-1), the survival rate of an isolated population is reduced by 10%, mainly through loss of fecundity, comparable to natural migration losses. Fishing is the main ecological stress and only dose rates in the range 0.03-0.1 Gy day(-1) can achieve discernible effects above it. On the balance of radiation and other ecological stresses, a benchmark value of 0.01 Gy day(-1) is proposed for the protection of lobster populations. This value appears consistent with available information on radiation effects in wildlife.",Excluded
3306,"A novel process for introducing a new intraoperative program: a multidisciplinary paradigm for mitigating hazards and improving patient safety. BACKGROUND: Since the Institute of Medicine's report, To Err is Human, was published, numerous interventions have been designed and implemented to correct the defects that lead to medical errors and adverse events; however, most efforts were largely reactive. Safety, communication, team performance, and efficiency are areas of care that attract a great deal of attention, especially regarding the introduction of new technologies, techniques, and procedures. We describe a multidisciplinary process that was implemented at our hospital to identify and mitigate hazards before the introduction of a new technique: high-dose-rate intraoperative radiation therapy, (HDR-IORT)., METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, radiation oncologists, physicists, nurses, hospital risk managers, and equipment specialists used a structured process that included in situ clinical simulation to uncover concerns among care providers and to prospectively identify and mitigate defects for patients who would undergo surgery using the HDR-IORT technique., RESULTS: We identified and corrected 20 defects in the simulated patient care process before application to actual patients. Subsequently, eight patients underwent surgery using the HDR-IORT technique with no recurrence of simulation-identified or unanticipated defects., CONCLUSION: Multiple benefits were derived from the use of this systematic process to introduce the HDR-IORT technique; namely, the safety and efficiency of care for this select patient population was optimized, and this process mitigated harmful or adverse events before the inclusion of actual patients. Further work is needed, but the process outlined in this paper can be universally applied to the introduction of any new technologies, treatments, or procedures.",Excluded
3594,"Detection of somatostatin receptor-positive tumours using the new 99mC-tricine-HYNIC-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide: First results in patients and comparison with 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide. Indium- 111 labelled DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide (DTPA-OC, OctreoScan) has been introduced into clinical routine for the detection of somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive tumours, which are predominantly of neuroendocrine origin. Potential further applications in other SSTR-positive cancers (e.g. small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma) have been limited mainly by the restricted availability and the high radionuclide costs. Previous attempts to introduce technetium-99m labelled analogues of octreotide have not been very successful in terms of the labelling procedure, in vivo bio- distribution and/or rumour detection capabilities. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of the new 99mTc-labelled analogue HYNIC-D- Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (HYNIC-TOC), using tricine as co-ligand, for the detection of SSTR-positive tumours in patients in comparison with 111In- DTPA-OC. Overall, 13 patients were examined using 99mTc-tricine-HYNIC-TOC. Twelve patients had proven SSTR-positive tumours, while one patient presented with an SSTR-negative tumour. In 9 of the 13 patients both tracers 99mTc- tricine-HYNIC-TOC and 111In-DTPA-OC) were used. Serial whole-body scans, spot views and/or single-photon emission tomography studies were performed. Images were qualitatively and semi-quantitatively (ROI analyses) evaluated. The biodistribution of 99mTc-tricine-HYNIC-TOC in patients showed high physiological uptake in kidneys, moderate uptake in liver and spleen and little uptake in the gut. The tracer showed predominantly renal and negligible hepatobiliary excretion. Known SSTR-positive tumour sites showed rapid and intense tracer accumulation. 99mTc-tricine-HYNIC-TOC demonstrated rapid tissue uptake within the first hour after injection and had basically no significant clearance (<20%) from normal or tumour tissue thereafter. In contrast, 111In-DTPA-OC showed continuous clearance from normal tissues as well as renal and very little hepatobiliary excretion. Nevertheless, the patterns of accumulation of 99mTc-tricine-HYNIC-TOC in tumours and normal organs were comparable to those of 111In-DTPA-OC. A lesion-by-lesion comparison showed comparable tumour detection capabilities in intrahepatic tumour sites and superior capabilities of 99mTc-tricine- HYNIC-TOC in respect of extrahepatic lesions. In conclusion, 99mTc- tricine-HYNIC-TOC shows promise as a tracer for SSTR imaging, given its favourable clinical characteristics (specific and high receptor affinity, good biodistribution, renal excretion, low radiation exposure, high imaging quality, on-demand availability) and cost-effectiveness. 99mTc-tricine- HYNIC-TOC allows earlier diagnosis (10 min-4 h) compared with 111In-DTPA- OC (4-24 h).",Excluded

1762,"Should hospitals protect from geopathogenic zones?. The belief that geopathogenic zones exist and could cause morbidity is widespread. It is increasing even among physicians. Presently, in health care it is going to even gain an economical dimension by causing investment costs for claimed protective means and by influencing hospital planning, design and management. Therefore, this issue is no longer just a private borderline issue but has become publicly relevant. In view of the fact that relevant studies are lacking, it deserves scientific clarification. In a double-blind study this hypothesis was tested by two different approaches: First, it was investigated whether location-bound biologic effects could be identified at all. To remain independent from dowsers, an investigation area of 35 m(2) was chosen which was large enough to ensure the presence of at least one postulated adverse zone. This area was scanned in 0.5 m intervals by monitoring bioparameters such as skin resistance, reaction time and heart rate variability in 43 volunteers. Skeptics were excluded. Location-dependent changes were investigated by point-by point analysis of local data distributions and by analysing the two-dimensional spatial distributions of the measured bioparameters by cross-correlation analysis. In a second approach, 5 independent experienced dowsers were asked to locate geopathogenic zones within the area both to verify the adequate choice of the area and to correlate the pattern of dowser's scorings with the patterns of biosignal distributions. Neither of these approaches showed statistical significant differences. The investigation did not confirm the hypothesis that local geopathogenic zones existed and, hence, would need protective actions.",Excluded

A variety of experimental tumour models have shown that cisplatin in combination with ionizing radiation enhances tumour regression. To evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and toxicity of a combined regimen, 25 patients with different solid tumours were treated with cisplatin and photon irradiation. A local tumour control was achieved in 22 cases. Thirteen patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (T1-3, N1-2, M0) received cisplatin (20 mg/m2 per day) on 5 consecutive days with NaCl hyperhydratation (0,9% NaCl, 2400 ml/24 hours as continuous infusion) in the first and last week of radiotherapy (5 X 2 Gy/week, 56 Gy target volume dose). 12 of 13 patients have shown local tumour control. Increased clinically evident side effects were not observed. From the underlying data the conclusion is drawn that the experimental results are reproducable under clinical conditions and that improved local tumour response rates can be achieved.",Excluded
3605,"Sun exposure before and after a diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma: Estimated by developments in serum vitamin D, skin pigmentation and interviews. Background Previous studies on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure before and after a diagnosis of cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) have been based primarily on questionnaires. Objective measures are needed. Objectives To assess changes in UVR exposure in patients with CMM using objective surrogate parameters in a descriptive study. Methods Ten patients recently diagnosed with CMM during the 5 months (autumn and winter) preceding study start in February 2009; 21 patients diagnosed from 12 months to 6 years before study start; and 15 controls, who matched the recently diagnosed patients on age, sex, residential area, constitutive skin type and occupation completed the investigations. UVR exposure before and after diagnosis of CMM was assessed using measures of serum 25-hydro vitamin D [25(OH)D], skin pigmentation and by interviews. Winter 25(OH)D was used as a surrogate parameter of UVR exposure the previous summer - the summer before CMM diagnosis in recently diagnosed patients. Results Winter 25(OH)D was significantly higher among recently diagnosed patients compared with controls (P = 0.02, R2 = 0.60) and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier (P = 0.01). The increase in 25(OH)D during the summer after diagnosis was significantly lower for recently diagnosed patients than for controls (P = 0.005, R2 = 0.51) and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier (P = 0.008). No difference was found in summer 25(OH)D between the groups. Conclusions Our findings suggest that patients with CMM had a higher UVR exposure the summer before diagnosis than did controls and patients diagnosed up to 6 years earlier, and that after diagnosis UVR exposure fell to the level of controls in patients with CMM. © 2011 The Authors.

1686,"Integrated resistance and aerobic exercise protects fitness during bed rest. INTRODUCTION: The current exercise countermeasures have not fully protected astronauts' preflight aerobic and muscular fitness levels during International Space Station (ISS) missions, prompting a need to optimize the exercise prescription to improve or maintain astronauts' ability to perform critical tasks and eventually extend the duration of missions., PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that an integrated resistance and aerobic exercise prescription performed with exercise equipment similar to that on the ISS can be tolerated and maintain cardiovascular and muscular fitness during 14 d of exposure to a model of microgravity., METHODS: Subjects (n = 9) participated in 14-21 d of pre-bed rest training and familiarization, 14 d of bed rest + iRAT exercise, and 7 d of ambulatory recovery. Peak aerobic capacity (VO2peak), ventilatory threshold (VT), and isokinetic and leg press tests were performed before and after bed rest to evaluate cardiovascular and muscle functions. Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) was determined before, during, and after bed rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)., RESULTS: Improvements from before to after bed rest were observed in VO2peak (2.8 +/- 0.2 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), VT (1.9 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.2 L.min(-1)), leg muscle power (1582 +/- 317 to 1740 +/- 359 W), and muscle CSA of the grouped vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis muscles (67.5 +/- 8.4 to 68.9 +/- 8.3 cm). Muscle strength and total CSA of the upper and lower legs were not different from before to after bed rest., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of exercise being completely effective for the prevention of cardiovascular and skeletal muscle deconditioning during strict bed rest using exercise equipment similar to that on the ISS.

1829,"Influence of the human papillomavirus on the radio-responsiveness of cancer stem cells in head and neck cancers. A growing proportion of head and neck cancers (HNC) result from HPV infection. Between HNC aetiological groups (HPV positive and HPV negative) clinical evidence demonstrates significantly better treatment response among HPV positive cancers. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are identified in HNC tumour populations as agents of treatment resistance and a target for tumour control. This study examines dynamic responses in populations of a CSC phenotype in HNC cell lines following X-irradiation at therapeutic levels, and comparing between HPV statuses. Variations in CSC density between HPV groups showed no correlation with better clinical outcomes seen in the HPV positive status. CSC populations in HPV positive cell lines ranged from 1.9 to 4.8%, and 2.6 to 9.9% for HPV negative. Following 4Gy X- irradiation however, HPV negative cell lines demonstrated more frequent and significantly greater escalation in CSC proportions, being 3-fold that of the HPV positive group at 72hours post irradiation. CSC proportions of tumour populations are not fixed but subject to change in response to radiation at therapeutic dose levels. These findings imply a potential effect of aetiology on radio-responsiveness in CSCs, illustrating that clonogen treatment response may be more informative of therapy outcomes than inherent population density alone.",Excluded
3003,"S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel criterion for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias. AIM: The correct estimation of the VA origin as RVOT or LVOT results in reduced ablation duration reduced radiation exposure and decreased number of vascular access. In our study, we aimed to detect the predictive value of S-R difference in V1-V2 for differentiating the left from right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias., METHODS: We included 123 patients with symptomatic frequent premature ventricular outflow tract contractions who underwent successful catheter ablation (70 male, 53 female; mean age 46.2 +/- 13.9 years, 61 RVOT, 62 LVOT origins). S-R difference in V1-V2 was calculated with this formula on the 12-lead surface ECG: (V1S + V2S) - (V1R + V2R). Conventional ablation was performed in 101 (82.1%) patients, CARTO electroanatomic mapping system was used in 22 (17.9%) patients., RESULTS: V1-2 SRd was found to be significantly lower for LVOT origins than RVOT origins (p < .001). The cutoff value of V1-2 SRd obtained by ROC curve analysis was 1.625 mV for prediction of RVOT origin (sensitivity: 95.1%, specificity: 85.5%, positive predictive value: 86.5%, negative predictive value: 94.5%). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.929 (p < .001)., CONCLUSION: S-R difference in V1-V2 is a novel and simple electrocardiographic criterion for accurately differentiating RVOT from LVOT sites of ventricular arrhythmia origins. The use of this simple ECG measurement could improve the accuracy of OTVA localization, could be beneficial for decreasing ablation duration and radiation exposure.

2701,"Acute Erythemal Ultraviolet Radiation Causes Systemic Immunosuppression in the Absence of Increased 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 Levels in Male Mice. Vitamin D is synthesised by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of skin and is hypothesized to be a direct mediator of the immunosuppression that occurs following UV radiation (UVR) exposure. Both UVR and vitamin D drive immune responses towards tolerance by ultimately increasing the suppressive activities of regulatory T cells. To examine a role for UVR-induced vitamin D, vitamin D3-deficient mice were established by dietary vitamin D3 restriction. In comparison to vitamin D3-replete mice, vitamin D3-deficient mice had significantly reduced serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3, <20 nmol.L-1) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3, <20 pmol.L-1). Following either acute erythemal UVR, or chronic sub-erythemal UVR (8 exposures over 4 weeks) treatment, serum 25(OH)D3 levels significantly increased in vitamin D3-deficient female but not male mice. To determine if UVR-induced vitamin D was a mediator of UVR-induced systemic immunosuppression, responses were measured in mice that were able (female) or unable (male) to increase systemic levels of 25(OH)D3 after UVR. Erythemal UVR (>=4 kJ/m2) suppressed contact hypersensitivity responses (T helper type-1 or -17), aspects of allergic airway disease (T helper type-2) and also the in vivo priming capacity of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to a similar degree in female and male vitamin D3-deficient mice. Thus, in male mice, UVR-induced 25(OH)D3 is not essential for mediating the immunosuppressive effects of erythemal UVR. © 2012 Gorman et al.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To prospectively compare the diagnostic performance of reduced-dose (RD) contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) with standard-dose (SD) CECT for detection of low-contrast liver lesions., METHODS: Seventy adults with non-liver primary malignancies underwent abdominal SD-CECT immediately followed by RD-CECT, aggressively targeted at 60-70 % dose reduction. SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72. ROC AUC values were 0.896/0.834/0.858/0.854 for SD-FBP/RD-FBP/RD-ASIR/RD-MBIR, respectively. RD-FBP (P = 0.002) and RD-MBIR (P = 0.032) AUCs were significantly lower than those of SD-FBP; RD-ASIR was not (P = 0.052). Reader confidence was lower for all RD series (P < 0.001) compared with SD-FBP, especially when calling patients entirely negative., CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive CT dose reduction resulted in inferior diagnostic performance and reader confidence for detection of low-contrast liver lesions compared to SD. Relative to RD-ASIR, RD-FBP showed decreased sensitivity and RD-MBIR showed decreased specificity., KEY POINTS: * Reduced-dose CECT demonstrates inferior diagnostic performance for detecting low-contrast liver lesions. * Reader confidence is lower with reduced-dose CECT compared to standard-dose CECT. * Overly aggressive dose reduction may result in misdiagnosis, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. * Careful consideration of perceived risks versus benefits of dose reduction is crucial.",Excluded

3005,"Dual BET/kinase inhibitors as a novel strategy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are important epigenetic regulators of critical oncogenes, including c-Myc. JQ1 is the most potent BRD4 inhibitor, currently used in several clinical trials and effective in preventing multiple myeloma progression in vivo. Currently, clinical data is showing that patients often develop acquired resistance, indicating that single agent therapies targeting BRD4 such as JQ1 may not provide durable therapeutic responses. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a new class of dual inhibitors, capable to simultaneously target BRD4 and a panel of tyrosine kinases highly expressed in cancer including JAK2, FLT3, RET, FGFR1, ULK1 and ULK3. A preliminary in vitro screening identified SG3-014 as the lead compound, showing BRD4 and c-Myc inhibition activity similar to JQ1, but additionally, it is capable of inhibiting kinases that are over-activated in cancer and responsible for cytokine-mediated drug resistance pathways. In vitro assays on MM cell lines reveals higher SG3-014 sensitivity (5TGM1, 0.85muM; U266, 0.99muM) compared to JQ1 (5TGM1, 4.7muM; U266, 16muM). In vivo studies using 1x106 5TGM1-Luc cells demonstrate that SG3-014 treatment (25mg/Kg) significantly contributes to overall survival compared to JQ1 and the vehicle control cohort (n=10/group) (median survival CTRL=40.5; SG3-014=50.5; JQ1=46 days). Post-study analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in myeloma induced bone disease in the SG3-014 treated mice as measured by X-ray/muCT/histomorphometry. Clinical datasets identified ULK3 as the candidate kinase of SG3-014 targeting activity and correlated its expression with MM disease stages. Since ULK3 is involved in cellular senescence and autophagy regulation, a key mechanism by which several cancer cell lines protect themselves against apoptosis and become resistant to standard treatments, we explored the role of SG3-014 inhibition in the autophagy pathway. Preliminary data confirm that SG3-014 is an autophagy inhibitor and, as opposed to JQ1, downregulates ATG proteins level, leading to dysfunctional autophagosome formation. We noted that within 6 h, SG3-014 completely shut down autophagy with decrease levels of ULK1, beclin-1, ATG16L-1, ATG12, ATG3, p62 and increased LC3I/II ratios (additionally confirmed by microscopy and flow cytometry). These effects were not noted with JQ1. Further investigation is clarifying the mechanism by which SG3-014 inhibitory activity on ULK3 is responsible for autophagy mediated cancer cell death. In order to validate this target in the progression of the human disease, our future directions will analyze ex vivo multiple myeloma patient samples and examine the efficacy of the inhibitor in CD138 isolated multiple myeloma cells derived from patient biopsies. We propose dual BRD4/autophagy inhibition as a resilient strategy to prevent multiple myeloma by-pass of single targeted therapies.",Excluded

PSD measurement (PSDFilm) was obtained by placing XR-RV3 Gafchromic under the patient's back for each procedure. PSD (PSDem.dose) was computed with the software em.dose©. The calculation was performed on the dose metrics collected from the private dose report of each procedure. Two calculation methods (method A: fluoroscopic kerma equally spread on cine acquisition and B: fluoroscopic kerma is added to one air Kerma cine acquisition that contributes to the PSD) were used to calculate the fluoroscopic dose contribution as fluoroscopic data were not recorded in our interventional room. Statistical analyses were carried out to compare PSDFilm and PSDem.dose., RESULTS: The PSDFilm median (1st quartile; 3rd quartile) was 0.251(0.190;0.336)Gy for CA-PTCA and 1.453(0.767;2.011)Gy for CTO.

Background: Although abdominal adiposity is associated with an altered cardiometabolic risk profile, the specific contribution of abdominal adipose tissue distribution remains not fully understood. Computed tomography (CT) is a well-established and precise method to measure abdominal adipose tissue distribution. The present study investigated abdominal adiposity assessed by CT in a large-scale Chinese population. Method(s): A total of 59,429 adults who underwent a low dose chest CT for lung cancer screening at one of 13 health checkup centers throughout China were evaluated. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured at the center of the 2nd lumbar vertebra with Mindways quantitative CT software using the existing CT dataset without any additional radiation exposure. The ratio of visceral to total adipose tissue (TAT) areas (VAT/TAT ratio) was calculated and expressed as a percentage. Anthropometric indices including body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were also obtained. Result(s): BMI, waist circumference, VAT area, SAT area, and the VAT/TAT ratio were 25.0 +/- 3.0 kg/m2, 90 +/- 8 cm, 194 +/- 77 cm2, 85 +/- 41 cm2, and 69.5 +/- 9.1%, respectively, in men and 23.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m2, 79 +/- 8 cm, 120 +/- 57 cm2, 123 +/- 53 cm2, and 48.9 +/- 9.7% in women. With increasing age, VAT area and the VAT/TAT ratio increased in both sexes whereas SAT area decreased in men (P < 0.001 for all). After adjustment for BMI and waist circumference, older individuals showed higher VAT area and higher VAT/TAT ratio than younger subjects (P < 0.001 for all). Adjusted VAT areas in participants aged 75 or older was 45 cm2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41 cm2, 50 cm2) higher in men and 43 cm2 (95% CI: 37 cm2, 49 cm2) higher in women compared with participants aged 31-44 years. Additionally, differences in VAT area across age groups increased as BMI or waist circumference increased. VAT and SAT areas, but not the VAT/TAT ratio, were positively associated with BMI and waist circumference in every age group. Conclusion(s): In a nationwide study conducted in China, distributions of CT-derived measures of visceral and subcutaneous adiposity were found to vary significantly between sex and age groups. Our study also revealed that the proportion of VAT (an important driver of cardiometabolic risk) could not be predicted from BMI in a Chinese population.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded
1340,"[Intraoperative radiotherapy in abdominal-pelvic cancer surgery]. Intraoperative radiotherapy consists in the irradiation of the affected area, exposed using anesthesiological and laparotomic procedures, following the removal of a neoplasia using palliative or macroscopically radical surgical. This increases local tumour control and augments the selectivity of treatment between healthy and neoplastic tissues, thus obtaining a marked improvement in survival or palliation. The authors analyse the data reported in international literature regarding the possible use of intraoperative radiotherapy in patients undergoing abdomino-pelvic oncological surgery. The aim of the study was to evaluate this method for use in selected and combined treatment in which surgery represents an obligatory step. Studies were carried out in a few highly specialised centres given that special technical, logistic and professional skills were required. The populations studied were often very small with a marked prevalence of feasibility studies compared to random studies. In spite of this intraoperative radiotherapy is undoubtedly indicated in locally advanced gastric, rectal and vesical neoplasia, it represents a valid palliative solution in pancreatic neoplasia and in pelvic recidivation, and an effective alternative solution to mutilating surgery in the initial stages of vesical cancer. Positive results are obtained in prostate and uterine cancer, but they are reported by non-conclusive studies.

501,"Synthesis of D-mannose capped silicon nanoparticles and their interactions with MCF-7 human breast cancerous cells. Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) hold prominent interest in various aspects of biomedical applications. For this purpose, surface functionalization of the NPs is essential to stabilize them, target them to specific disease area, and allow them to selectively bind to the cells or the bio-molecules present on the surface of the cells. However, no such functionalization has been explored with Si nanoparticles. Carbohydrates play a critical role in cell recognition. Here, we report the first synthesis of silicon nanoparticles functionalized with carbohydrates. In this study, stable and brightly luminescent d-Mannose (Man) capped SiNPs have been synthesized from amine terminated SiNPs and d-mannopyranoside acid. The surface functionalization is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) studies. The mean diameter of the crystal core is 5.5 nm, as measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the hydrodynamic diameter obtained by dynamic light scattering (DLS) is 16 nm. The quantum yield (QY) of photoluminescence emission is found to be 11.5%, and the nanoparticles exhibit an exceptional stability over two weeks. The Man-capped SiNPs may prove to be valuable tools for further investigating glycobiological, biomedical, and material science fields. Experiments are carried out using Concanavalin A (ConA) as a target protein in order to prove the hypothesis. When Man functionalized SiNPs are treated with ConA, cross-linked aggregates are formed, as shown in TEM images as well as monitored by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Man functionalized SiNPs can target cancerous cells. Visualization imaging of SiNPs in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells shows the fluorescence is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of these cells.",Excluded
391,"Have increases in solar ultraviolet exposure contributed to the rise in incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma?. The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has increased substantially in many countries over recent decades. The aetiology of this cancer is poorly understood, and this rise is largely unexplained. The incidence of NHL is known to increase markedly following immune suppression. In the light of evidence that exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) may cause systemic immune suppression, part of the recent increase in NHL incidence may reflect population-based increases in UVR exposure. That such exposure increases have occurred is inferred from the widespread increases in skin cancer incidence in fair-skinned populations, especially malignant melanoma (MM), over recent decades. Epidemiological evidence presented here in support of the proposed UVR-NHL relationship includes the following: in Caucasian populations there is a moderate positive correlation between ambient UVR level, by latitude, and NHL incidence; there is also a positive correlation between time trends in MM incidence and NHL; there is some evidence that migration across latitude gradients induces concordant shifts in risks of NHL and MM. Data from two historical cancer patient registers show that, in individuals, these two cancers concurred a little more often than expected. These findings support recent suggestions that UVR-induced impairment of immune functioning contributes to the aetiology of NHL.",Excluded
2299,"Dynamic multidetector CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR for right adrenal vein imaging: comparison with catheter venography in adrenal venous sampling. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate visualization of the right adrenal vein (RAV) with multidetector CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging in patients with primary aldosteronism., METHODS: A total of 125 patients (67 men) scheduled for adrenal venous sampling (AVS) were included. Dynamic 64-detector-row CT and balanced steady-state free precession-based non-contrast-enhanced 3-T MR imaging were performed. RAV visualization based on a four-point score was documented. Both anatomical location and variation on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated, and the findings were compared with catheter venography as the gold standard., RESULTS: The RAV was visualized in 93.2% by CT and 84.8% by MR imaging (p = 0.02). Positive predictive values of RAV visualization were 100% for CT and 95.2% for MR imaging. Imaging score was significantly higher in CT than MR imaging (p < 0.01). The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 16% of patients. The RAV orifice level on cross-sectional imaging was concordant with catheter venography within the range of 1/3 vertebral height in >70% of subjects. Success rate of AVS was 99.2%., CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT is a reliable way to map the RAV prior to AVS. Non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging is an alternative when there is a risk of complication from contrast media or radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: Dynamic CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging detect the right adrenal vein (RAV). Dynamic CT can visualize the RAV more than non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Mapping the RAV helps to achieve successful adrenal venous sampling. Sixteen per cent of RAVs share the common trunk with accessory hepatic veins.",Excluded
1062,"Solo sonographically guided PCNL under spinal anesthesia-results of 165 cases. Aim: The well-known serious harms of radiation have encouraged surgeons to use it as low as necessary. Hence, sonography was brought in as an adjunct to X-Ray to restrict radiation exposure in PCNL. This study was designed to respond this question that is sonography proper enough to supersede X-Ray in PCNL? Methods: 165 consecutive cases were prospectively enrolled. All steps of access to the system, single shot tract dilatation and residue checking were performed solely under sonography guidance; i.e. without any usage of x-ray under spinal anesthesia. Decision to place a nephrostomy tube was made based on the surgeon's judgment on the system injury or bleeding. Result(s): male to female ratio was 5/3. Mean age was 46+/-15 years. Forty percent of kidneys showed hydronephrosis and 20 percent of stones were nonopaque. Mean stone burden was 504+/-350 mm2. Mean duration of surgery was 42+/-21 minutes. Stone free rate was 85% in patients with single pelvic stone and 75% in staghorn cases. Mean residual stone size was 15+/-9 mm. Admission time was 2 days on average. Fifteen percent of patients showed grade I or II complication and in six percent grade III complication occurred based on Clavien classification. There was no case organ injury or death. Complication rate was directly related to surgery duration. Conclusion(s): Sonographically guided PCNL is feasible with acceptable stone free rate and complication.",Excluded
1221,"Renal atrophy after stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Renal atrophy is observed in an irradiated kidney. The aim of this study was to determine dose-volume histogram parameters and other factors that predict renal atrophy after 10-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)., METHODS: A total of 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) who received SBRT for RCC at Tohoku University Hospital between April 2010 and February 2014 were analyzed. The median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl and two patients had a single kidney. Nine patients were implanted with fiducial markers. The median tumor diameter was 30 mm. SBRT was delivered at 70 Gy in 10 fractions for 7 tumors, at 60 Gy in 10 fractions for 2 tumors, and at 50 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 tumors with 6 and/or 15 MV X-ray using 5 to 8 multi-static beams. Renal atrophy was assessed using post-SBRT CT images after 12-24 months intervals. Correlations were examined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Differences between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and pairwise comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: The median tumor volume shrunk from 14.8 cc to 10.6 cc (p = 0.12), and the median irradiated kidney volume changed from 160.4 cc to 137.1 cc (p < .01). The median peak creatinine level was 1.6 mg/dl after treatment (p < .01). Percentage volumes of the irradiated kidney receiving at least 10 Gy (V10, p = 0.03), V20 (p < .01), V30(p < .01), V40 (p = 0.01), mean irradiated kidney dose (p < .01), and magnitude of overlap between PTV and kidney volume (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with post-treatment irradiated kidney volume in percent, and V20-V30 had strong correlation (r < -0.70, p < .01). Patients with implanted fiducial markers showed a significantly lower ratio of renal atrophy (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant renal atrophic change was observed. Dose distribution of SBRT at 20-30 Gy had a strong correlation with renal atrophy when irradiation was performed in 10 fractions.",Excluded
3475,"Masking responses to light in period mutant mice. Masking is an acute effect of an external signal on an overt rhythm and is distinct from the process of entrainment. In the current study, we investigated the phase dependence and molecular mechanisms regulating masking effects of light pulses on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The circadian genes, Period1 (Per1) and Per2, are necessary components of the timekeeping machinery and entrainment by light appears to involve the induction of the expression of Per1 and Per2 mRNAs in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We assessed the roles of the Per genes in regulating masking by assessing the effects of light pulses on nocturnal locomotor activity in C57BL/6J Per mutant mice. We found that Per1-/- and Per2-/- mice had robust negative masking responses to light. In addition, the locomotor activity of Per1 -/-/Per2-/- mice appeared to be rhythmic in the light-dark (LD) cycle, and the phase of activity onset was advanced (but varied among individual mice) relative to lights off. This rhythm persisted for 1 to 2 days in constant darkness in some Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice. Furthermore, Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice exhibited robust negative masking responses to light. Negative masking was phase dependent in wild-type mice such that maximal suppression was induced by light pulses at zeitgeber time 14 (ZT14) and gradually weaker suppression occurred during light pulses at ZT16 and ZT18. By measuring the phase shifts induced by the masking protocol (light pulses were administered to mice maintained in the LD cycle), we found that the phase responsiveness of Per mutant mice was altered compared to wild-types. Together, our data suggest that negative masking responses to light are robust in Per mutant mice and that the Per1-/-/Per2-/- SCN may be a light-driven, weak/damping oscillator.

Objective: The aim of our study is to analyse the results of percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy for treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. Method(s): We inspected the results of 106 patients with the diagnoses of idiopathic neuralgia that treated with percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy retrospectively. The scores of visual analog scale(VAS) were noted preoperative and postoperative periods at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months and were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean age of 106 patients was 67.31+/-8.85 years. Duration of symptoms was 19.1+/-13.1 months. Duration of symptoms did not change significantly according to gender (p=0.755), or site of trigeminal pain (p=0.158). There was not any statistical significance between gender, effected branch of trigemial nerve and side of the pain. Preoperative mean VAS score was 9.6+/-0.75. Postoperative mean VAS score values were 3.25+/-2.44 at first month, 3.23+/-2.43 at third months, 3.12+/-2.78 at sixth months and 2.59+/-3.18 at postoperative twelfth months. We found statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months VAS scores (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy is the minimally invasive treatment modality with lower complication rates and it has a high rate of efficacy when compared with invasive methods. It is most cost-effective procedure to choose if the pain recurs.Copyright © 2018, AVES Ibrahim KARA. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2287,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for intractable cluster headache: An initial report from the North American Gamma Knife Consortium: Clinical article. Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) when used for patients with intractable cluster headache (CH). Methods. Four participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 17 patients who underwent GKS for intractable CH between 1996 and 2008. The median patient age was 47 years (range 26-83 years). The median duration of pain before GKS was 10 years (range 1.3-40 years). Seven patients underwent unsuccessful prior surgical procedures, including microvascular decompression (2 patients), microvascular decompression with glycerol rhizotomy (2 patients), deep brain stimulation (1 patient), trigeminal ganglion stimulation (1 patient), and prior GKS (1 patient). Fourteen patients had associated autonomic symptoms. The radiosurgical target was the trigeminal nerve (TN) root and the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in 8 patients, only the TN in 8 patients, and only the SPG in 1 patient. The median maximum TN and SPG dose was 80 Gy. Results. Favorable pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute Grades I-IIIb) was achieved and maintained in 10 (59%) of 17 patients at a median follow-up of 34 months. Three patients required additional procedures (repeat GKS in 2 patients, hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in 1 patient). Eight (50%) of 16 patients who had their TN irradiated developed facial sensory dysfunction after GKS. Conclusions. Gamma Knife surgery for intractable, medically refractory CH provided lasting pain reduction in approximately 60% of patients, but was associated with a significantly greater chance of facial sensory disturbances than GKS used for trigeminal neuralgia.",Excluded
1578,"Influence of previous radiation exposure on pathologic features and clinical outcome in patients with thyroid cancer. Objective: To determine whether previous radiation exposure to the head and neck is related to less favorable pathologic and clinical outcome in patients after surgical management of thyroid cancer. Design(s): Retrospective chart review. Setting(s): Academic teaching hospital (referral center). Patient(s): All patients with diagnosed thyroid cancer who had been exposed to radiation before surgical treatment were retrospectively identified from the thyroid cancer database at our institution (1963-2007). One hundred twenty-five patients (95 women and 30 men) were included. Inclusion criteria included surgical treatment for thyroid cancer and a history of exposure to radiation at least 3 years before diagnosis of the disease. Main Outcome Measure(s): Pathologic features and data related to disease recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival. Result(s): Mean (range) age at first exposure to radiation was 19.4 (1-65) years, and mean lag time to diagnosis of disease was 28.7 (3-60) years. Patients were treated surgically with either total or near-total thyroidectomy (83%) or partial or subtotal thyroidectomy (17%). Pathologic diagnoses included 111 papillary carcinomas (89%). Sixty- three percent of patients had multifocal disease, 12% had lymphovascular tumor invasion, and 26% had direct ex- trathyroid extension of disease. Twenty-five percent of patients had metastases to cervical lymph nodes, and 9% had distant metastases. Sixteen percent of patients experienced local recurrence of disease. At last follow-up, 86% of patients were alive and free of disease, 8% were alive with disease, 4% had died of thyroid cancer, and 2% had died of an unrelated cause. Compared with other patients with thyroid cancer, this radiation-exposed cohort was more likely to undergo total thyroidectomy, multiple operative procedures, and external radiotherapy. A higher percentage had multifocal disease, extrathyroid extension, stage IV disease, and distant metastases. At follow-up, fewer patients were free of disease, and more patients had died of thyroid disease. Conclusion(s): Patients who have been exposed to radiation have more aggressive disease and worse clinical outcome than other patients with thyroid cancer. © 2009 American Medical Association.

433,"Phase I dose-escalation study of endoscopic intratumoral injection of OBP-301 (Telomelysin) with radiotherapy in oesophageal cancer patients unfit for standard treatments. PURPOSE: OBP-301 (Telomelysin) is an attenuated type-5 adenovirus that contains the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter to regulate viral replication. OBP-301 sensitises human cancer cells to ionising radiation by inhibiting DNA repair, and radiation enhances coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor-mediated OBP-301 infection on the contrary. We assessed OBP-301 with radiotherapy in oesophageal cancer patients unfit for standard chemoradiation treatments., METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study of OBP-301 with radiotherapy was conducted in 13 histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer patients deemed unfit to undergo surgery or chemotherapy. Study treatment consisted of OBP-301 administration by intratumoural needle injection using a flexible endoscope on days 1, 18 and 32. Radiotherapy was administered concurrently over 6 weeks, beginning on day 4, to a total of 60 Gy., RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, 7, 3 and 3 patients were treated with 1010, 1011 and 1012 virus particles, respectively. Study group comprised 10 males and 3 females, with a median age of 82 years (range, 53-91 years). All patients developed a transient, self-limited lymphopenia. Distribution studies revealed transient virus shedding in the plasma. Eight patients had local complete response (CR); all of them exhibited no pathologically viable malignant cells in biopsy specimens, and 3 patients had a partial response. The objective response rate was 91.7%. The clinical CR rate was 83.3% in stage I and 60.0% in stage II/III. Histopathological examination revealed massive infiltration of CD8+ cells and increased PD-L1 expression., CONCLUSION: Multiple courses of endoscopic intratumoural OBP-301 injection with radiotherapy are feasible and provide clinical benefits in patients with oesophageal cancer unfit for standard treatments.

2870,"When should the doctor order a spine X-ray? Identifying vertebral fractures for osteoporosis care: results from the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS). UNLABELLED: Vertebral fractures are common but usually remain unrecognized in primary care. Data from 2908 women and 2653 men in the EPOS study were used to derive algorithms to indicate the need for a spine X-ray to identify a fracture using easily elicited determinants. At a sensitivity of 50% for identifying cases, the specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men compared with a random allocation of X-rays. Use of X-rays can be optimized by selecting patients at high risk using a short screening procedure., INTRODUCTION: Previous osteoporotic fracture is an independent risk factor for further fractures and an indication for treatment. Vertebral fractures are the most common osteoporotic fractures before age 75, accounting for 48% of all fractures in men and 39% in women over 50. They usually remain unrecognized, so many patients requiring treatment are denied it, doubling their risk of a further fracture. Our objective was to develop an efficient algorithm indicating the need for an X-ray., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from 2908 women and 2653 men >or=50 years of age in the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study (EPOS) were analyzed. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were taken at baseline and at an average of 3.8 years later. Prevalent fractures were qualitatively diagnosed by an experienced radiologist. Fracture risk was modeled as a function of age, statural height loss since age 25, gender, and fracture history including limb fractures in the last 3 years using negative binomial regression. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to summarize a model's predictive ability, and a prediction algorithm was devised to identify those most likely to have a fracture., RESULTS: In a multivariate model for women, the risk of prevalent vertebral fracture significantly increased with age (RR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.46, 1.93] per decade), statural height loss (1.06, [1.03, 1.10] per centimeter decrease), self-reported history of spine fracture (7.52 [5.52, 10.23]), and history of other major fracture (1.83 [1.46, 2.28]). Higher body weight reduced risk (0.86 [0.79, 0.95] per 10-kg increase). In men, the respective RR estimates were as follows: age (1.32 [1.18, 1.49]); height loss (1.06 [1.04, 1.09]); self-reported spine fracture (5.05 [3.69, 6.90]); other major fracture (1.42 [1.12, 1.81]); and weight (0.86 [0.79, 0.94]). Using algorithms based on these easily elicited determinants, specificity was increased from 50% to 78% in women and from 50% to 72% in men at a sensitivity of 50% compared with a random allocation of X-rays. At a sensitivity of 75%, the specificity was 50% in women and 40% in men. Inclusion of hip BMD (femoral neck or trochanter), measured in 1360 women and 1046 men, significantly improved the area under the ROC curves by 4% in women (p < 0.002) but not in men (p > 0.350). Spine BMD, measured in 982 women and 847 men, produced a significant 5% AUC improvement in women (p = 0.007) but not in men (p = 0.554)., CONCLUSION: A woman 65 years of age with one vertebral fracture has a one in four chance of another fracture over 5 years, which can be reduced to one in eight by treatment. Positive treatment decisions are often contingent on identifying a vertebral fracture. Selective use of lateral vertebral X-rays can be optimized using a 2-minute screening procedure administered by a nurse.",Excluded
3071,"FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of presacral soft tissue in restaging of rectal cancer patients. Objective: Presacral soft tissue is often seen on diagnostic follow-up CT after primary surgical treatment of rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of FDG PET/CT and diagnostic CT in the evaluation of presacral soft tissue in restaging rectal cancer patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-eight patients (age range, 36-73 years; men and women) with rectal cancer after primary treatment underwent FDG PET/CT for evaluation of presacral soft tissue detected on diagnostic contrast CT. CT was performed for restaging of suspected recurrence based on clinical findings and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). PET findings were correlated with CEA levels and biopsy findings. PET was considered positive if there was abnormal presacral soft-tissue uptake greater than surrounding activity. Result(s): Of the 68 patients, 42 were PET-positive and 26 were negative. Of the 42 PET-positive patients, 27 had biopsy-proven recurrent cancer, CEA was elevated in 26 patients and normal in one patient. CEA was normal in 12 of 15 patients with positive PET and negative biopsy. Among the 26 PET-negative patient, CEA was normal in 14, without disease elsewhere. CEA was elevated in 12 patients with negative PET (three had inflammation on biopsy, one mucinous adenocarcinoma, and eight had malignancy at extrapelvic sites. Conclusion(s): FDG PET/CT and CEA are complementary in follow-up of presacral soft tissue in rectal cancer restaging. Abnormal presacral FDG uptake with elevated CEA indicates presacral recurrence, whereas positive PET with normal CEA does not usually indicate recurrence. Negative PET with normal CEA can be considered benign avoiding the need for biopsy.",Excluded
2832,"Management of mediastinal relapse after treatment with stereotactic body radiotherapy or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy for stage I/II non-small-cell lung cancer. Purpose/Objective(s): Regional failures occur in up to 15% of patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for stage I/II lung cancer. This report focuses on the management of the unique scenario of isolated regional failures. Method(s): Patients treated initially with SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy were screened for curative intent treatment of isolated mediastinal failures (IMFs). Local control, regional control, progression-free survival, and distant control were estimated from the date of salvage treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): Among 160 patients treated from 2002 to 2012, 12 suffered IMF and were amenable to salvage treatment. The median interval between treatments was 16 months (2-57 mo). Median salvage dose was 66 Gy (60-70 Gy). With a median follow-up of 10 months, the median overall survival was 15 months (95% confidence interval, 5.8-37 mo). When estimated from original treatment, the median overall survival was 38 months (95% confidence interval, 17-71 mo). No subsequent regional failures occurred. Distant failure was the predominant mode of relapse following salvage for IMF with a 2-year distant control rate of 38%. At the time of this analysis, three patients have died without recurrence while four are alive and no evidence of disease. High-grade toxicity was uncommon. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge, this is first analysis of salvage mediastinal radiation after SBRT or accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy in lung cancer. Outcomes appear similar to stage III disease at presentation. Distant failures were common, suggesting a role for concurrent or sequential chemotherapy. A standard full course of external beam radiotherapy is advisable in this unique clinical scenario.© Copyright 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

2010,"Association of clinical response and long-term outcome among patients with biopsied orbital pseudotumor receiving modern radiation therapy. Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate institutional outcomes for patients treated with modern radiation therapy (RT) for biopsied orbital pseudotumor (OP). Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (26 affected orbits) with OP were treated with RT between January 2002 and December 2011. All patients underwent biopsy with histopathologic exclusion of other disease processes. Sixteen patients (80%) were treated with intensity modulated RT, 3 (15%) with opposed lateral beams, and 1 (5%) with electrons. Median RT dose was 27 Gy (range 25.2-30.6 Gy). Response to RT was evaluated at 4 months post-RT. Partial response (PR) was defined as improvement in orbital symptoms without an increase in steroid dose. Complete response (CR) 1 and CR 2 were defined as complete resolution of orbital symptoms with reduction in steroid dose (CR 1) or complete tapering of steroids (CR 2). The median follow-up period was 18.6 months (range 4-81.6 months). Result(s): Seventeen patients (85%) demonstrated response to RT, with 7 (35%), 1 (5%), and 9 (45%) achieving a PR, CR 1, and CR 2, respectively. Of the 17 patients who had >=PR at 4 months post-RT, 6 (35%) experienced recurrence of symptoms. Age (>46 years vs <=46 years, P=.04) and clinical response to RT (CR 2 vs CR 1/PR, P=.05) were significantly associated with pseudotumor recurrence. Long-term complications were seen in 7 patients (35%), including 4 with cataract formation, 1 with chronic dry eye, 1 with enophthalmos, and 1 with keratopathy. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective treatment for improving symptoms and tapering steroids in patients with a biopsy supported diagnosis of OP. Older age and complete response to RT were associated with a significantly reduced probability of symptom recurrence. The observed late complications may be related to RT, chronic use of steroids/immunosuppressants, medical comorbidities, or combination of factors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2643,"Impact of treatment interruptions due to toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy alone. We investigated the effect of treatment interruptions due to high-grade (> or =3) toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (Hfx RT). Of 116 patients treated with total tumour doses of 69.6 Gy, 1.2 Gy b.i.d. fractionation, 44 patients refused surgery while 72 patients were medically inoperable due to existing co-morbid states. Patients who were medically inoperable had worse KPS (P=0.0059) and more pronounced weight loss (P=0.0005). Among them, 12 patients experienced high-grade toxicity and 11 of them with either acute (n=6) or ""consequential"" late (n=5) high-grade toxicity requested interruption in the Hfx RT course (range, 12-25 days; median, 17 days). Superior survival (OS) was observed in patients who refused surgery when compared to those who were medically inoperable (P=0.0041), as well as superior local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (P=0.011), but not different distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.14). Cause-specific survival (CSS) also favoured patients who refused surgery (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis showed independent influence of the reason for not undergoing surgery on OS (P=0.035), but not on LRFS (P=0.084) or CSS (P=0.068). Patients who refused surgery did not experience high-grade toxicity (0/44), whereas 11 of 72 patients with medical inoperability and co-morbid states experienced high-grade toxicity and had treatment interruptions to manage toxicity (P=0.0064). Patients without treatment interruptions had significantly better OS (P=0.00000), LRFS (P=0.00000) and CSS (P=0.00000) than those with treatment interruptions. When corrected for treatment interruptions, the reason for not undergoing surgery independently influenced OS (P=0.040), but not LRFS (P=0.092) or CSS (P=0.068). In contrast to this, treatment interruption was independent prognosticator of all three endpoints used (P=0.00031, P=0.0075 and P=0.00033, respectively). When 11 patients with treatment interruptions were excluded, the reason for not undergoing surgery still affected OS (P=0.037) and CSS (P=0.039) but not LRFS (P=0.11). Multivariate analyses using OS, CSS and LRFS showed that the reason for not undergoing surgery affected OS (P=0.0436), but neither CSS (P=0.083) nor LRFS (P=0.080).",Excluded
1236,Postoperative X-ray chest after supracostal puncture: Mandatory after every case of percutaneous nephrolithotomy?. Introduction and Objective: It is a routine practice to get postoperative X-ray done after supracostal access in PCNL. Although the incidence of hydro-pneumothorax is very less and routine X-ray chest unnecessarily increase the radiation exposure to patients. The aim of our study was to assess the role of postoperative X-ray chest after supra costal puncture in PCNL for the detection and management of pneumothorax and/or hydrothorax. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 347 patients who underwent PCNL at our institute between Jan. 2007 and February 2011. 66.6% were male and 33.4% were female. Out of 347 PCNL supracostal upper calyceal puncture was done in 102 patients: 54 on right side and 48 on left side. In 23 patients three punctures were made and 31 patients required two tracts for complete stone clearance. Result(s): All punctures were done between 11-12th intercostal space and all patients underwent a post operative X-ray chest. In 1 patient hydro pneumothorax was detected which improved after intercostal chest tube drainage. One patient had mild pleural effusion which was managed conservatively. Both these patients had complaint of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period. In rest of the patients chest X-rays were normal and had no respiratory discomfort in post operative period. Conclusion(s): Routine post operative X-ray chest is not mandatory after every PCNL with supracostal access. When intra-operative pneumothorax is suspected or patient complain of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period then X-ray chest should be done.,Excluded

This North Central Cancer Treatment Group study was undertaken to confirm the antidiarrheal effect of sucralfate. Several other measures of bowel function were also assessed. Patients and Methods: Patients receiving pelvic RT to a minimum of 45 Gy at 1.7 to 2.1 Gy/d were eligible for the study. Patients were assigned randomly, in double-blind fashion, to receive sucralfate (1.5 g orally every 6 hours) or an identical looking placebo during pelvic RT. Result(s): One hundred twenty-three patients were randomly assigned and found assessable. Overall, there was no significant difference in patient characteristics between those receiving sucralfate and those receiving placebo. Moderate or worse diarrhea was observed in 53% of patients receiving sucralfate versus 41% of those receiving placebo. Compared with patients receiving placebo, more sucralfate-treated patients reported fecal incontinence (16% v 34%, respectively; P = .04) and need for protective clothing (8% v 23%, respectively; P = .04). The incidence and severity of nausea were worse among those taking sucralfate (P = .03). Analysis of patient-reported symptoms 10 to 12 months after RT showed a nonsignificant trend toward more problems in patients taking sucralfate than in those taking placebo (average, 2.3 v 1.9 problems, respectively; P = .34). Conclusion(s): Sucralfate did not decrease pelvic RT-related bowel toxicity by any of the end points measured and seems to have aggravated some gastrointestinal symptoms.

2054,"Multilevel analysis of solar radiation and cancer mortality using ecological data in Japan. A preventive effect of solar radiation on cancer has been suspected. This study aimed to compare the statistical relationship between solar radiation and cancer mortality according to hierarchical models and adjustment for confounding factors, and then to demonstrate the relationship with main site-specific cancer mortalities in Japan. We examined the relationship between all-site and main site-specific cancer mortalities and global solar radiation using Poisson regression with municipal data around 2000. The models included single-level (municipality) and multilevel (municipality and prefecture) with/without potential confounding factors (lifestyle and socioeconomic variables). For all-site cancer, single-level analysis showed a significant, strong negative association with solar radiation. However, multilevel analysis showed a moderate or no association. In multilevel analysis with potential confounding factors, solar radiation was significantly negatively associated with most site-specific cancers, but not with gallbladder and liver cancer in men and stomach and breast cancer in women. Our findings support the preventive effective of solar radiation on several types of cancer. However, to show a concrete relationship, a statistical model with an appropriate hierarchy and adjustment for potential confounding factors is required.",Excluded
2947,"Patterns of Care Study of radiation therapy for esophageal cancer in Japan: Influence of age on parameters of treatment. Background. In Japan, the elderly population is growing rapidly, and therefore, so is the number of cancer patients who are not good candidates for aggressive surgery or chemotherapy. Radiation therapy offers excellent potential for the treatment of such patients, with minimal invasion and functional preservation. A Patterns of Care Study (PCS) examined the parameters of treatments used for patients with esophageal cancer to determine nationwide variations by age. Methods. From July 1996 through February 1997, external nationwide PCS audits were performed for 29 institutions. Medical charts were reviewed for 455 patients with thoracic esophageal cancer treated between 1992 and 1994. The parameters of treatments used for these patients were compared between those aged >=75 years (elderly; n = 113) and those aged <75 years (younger; n = 342). Results. Surgery was used in 49% of the younger group and in 17% of the elderly group (P < 0.0001) while chemotherapy was used in 48% of the younger and 24% of the older group (P < 0.0001). The ratio of non-surgery group with radiation therapy increased significantly from 49% to 82% (P < 0.0001). Approximately 70% of the non- surgery patients received an external radiation dose of more than 60 Gy, even in the elderly (P = 0.3001). Preliminary results showed no significant difference in survival between the two age groups (P = 0.5559). Conclusions. The use of radiation therapy in elderly people with esophageal cancer has increased markedly. The PCS provided important information about variations in radiotherapy parameters in patients with esophageal cancer in relation to age. Such information should be useful for future prospective studies of the elderly.",Excluded
983,"Magnetic navigation in left-sided AV reentrant tachycardias: Preliminary results of a retrograde approach. Introduction: A novel magnetic navigation system allows remote guidance of floppy radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheters. We evaluated the feasibility of mapping and ablation of left-sided accessory pathways (APs) using the retrograde transaortic approach with this system. This might open the gate to retrograde ablation of left atrial arrhythmias. Methods and Results: Twenty consecutive patients were included. A Helios II was used in five and in 15 a Celsius RMT RF catheter with higher magnetic mass and different flexibility was used. Mapping and ablation were attempted. The learning curve was analyzed. Ablation was acutely successful in 60% of the patients using the Helios II and in 80% using the Celsius RMT. Median procedure time was 158 minutes, with median patient and physician fluoroscopy times of 26 and 4 minutes. In the last 10 patients, procedure times became significantly shorter (median 122 minutes, only Celsius RMT catheters) and standard catheters had to be used only twice. No complications occurred. Conclusion(s): Remote retrograde transaortic RF ablation of left-sided APs is feasible, safe, and reduces the physician's fluoroscopy exposure. There is a very steep initial learning curve, with the success rate increasing from 50% in the first 10 cases to 80% in the last 10 cases. Different catheter configurations may influence the outcome. © 2007 by Futura Publishing Company, Inc.",Excluded

In 1993, 181 new cases (36 men and 145 women) of thyroid cancer were diagnosed pathologically in Hungary, i.e. a morbidity of 1.8/100,000 for the total population, and of 0.7/100,000 and 2.7/100,000 for men and women, respectively. The distribution of the histological diagnoses: 61% papillary, 25% follicular, 5% medullary and 3% anaplastic carcinomas, and 6% others. In the same year, 125 patients (31 men and 94 women) died from thyroid cancer, i.e. a mortality rate of 1.2/100,000 for the total population, and of 0.6/100,000 and 1.8/100,000 for men and women, respectively. The relatively low morbidity reflects the fact that no new strong aetiological factor is operative in Hungary. The substantial mortality rate, however, is influenced by the geographically determined aggressivity of the disease, the inadequacy of the diagnostic procedures and therapeutic measures, and lack of the active follow-up. The latter facts are especially prominent in centres with a low patient turnover. In the field of health care, various measures must be introduced to prevent an increase in the morbidity and to diminish the mortality. Reduction of the iodine deficiency, rationalization of the medical use of ionizing irradiation, and implementation of the necessary hormonal medication for all patients operated by resection for thyroid diseases are needed for tumour prophylaxis. Before any medical decision-making, the achievement of complete diagnostic information, including the pathological revision of clinically questionable cases, is of paramount importance. The fundamental goals as concerns the treatment modalities are as follows: increased surgical skill and level of performance of external irradiation, the availability of radionuclide therapy, and guidance of all types of thyroxine medication by endocrine experts.",Excluded
1086,"Radiation-induced lung injury on PET/CT: Analysis of FDG uptake response within specific isodose regions of irradiation in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Objective: Inflammatory response associated with radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) results in an increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). In this study, we aimed to analyze the degree of FDG uptake within specific isodose regions (IR) of the irradiated lung using standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements, and to correlate posttreatment FDG uptake with radiotherapy (RT) dose parameters, patient characteristics and the imaging time interval after RT completion. Material(s) and Method(s): Data from 30 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent FDG PET/CT imaging at least 12 weeks (72-668 days) after completion of RT were evaluated. In each patient, side-by-side visual registration of the treatment planning CT slices including IR curves with the corresponding PET/CT slices was performed. Using SUV measurements, FDG uptake levels were analyzed within specific IRs of the irradiated lung. The statistical difference between SUVmax of each IR was determined. The RT dose parameters, patient characteristics and time interval between RT and PET/CT were tested for correlation with SUV- max of IRs. Result(s): The mean SUVmax in the IRs of the lung that received 2000-4000cGy was 1.51 +/- 0.66 (mean +/- SD) (min-max: 0.69-2.84), 4000-6000cGy was 2.67 +/- 1.16 (min-max: 0.71-6.0), and >6000Gy was 3.55 +/- 1.09 (min-max: 1.2-5.72). We found statistically significant differences between the SUVmax values of all IRs (SUV2000 vs. SUV4000, p= 0.001; SUV2000 vs.6000, p= 0.002; SUV4000 vs. 6000, p= 0.001). No statistically significant correlation was found between SUVmax and the other variables. Conclusion(s): The findings of this study showed that, although some overlap occurs between IRs, the degree of radiation-related parenchymal FDG uptake gets higher with increasing dose levels. Persistent high FDG uptake levels may be observed in radiation fibrosis areas on PET/CT even several months after RT. © 2011 by Turkiye Klinikleri.",Excluded
3632,"Doctors' knowledge of radiation -- a two-centre study and historical comparison. AIM: To investigate knowledge of the use of ionizing radiation in 2010 and whether there has been any change in this knowledge since the study was first undertaken over 7 years ago. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In both studies a single chest x-ray was classed as one unit of radiation. Doctors from all grades were asked to evaluate the average radiation dose incurred with 13 commonly undertaken radiological procedures, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), etc. Answers within 20% of the actual dose were marked as correct. RESULTS: Two hundred and forty-two questionnaires were completed (130 in 2003; 112 in 2010). Equal numbers of juniors, middle grades, and consultants were questioned, and scores were comparable (23.3% in 2003; 29.4% in 2010). The majority of doctors (92% in 2003; 86% in 2010) correctly noted that ultrasound and MRI involve no radiation. Doctors underestimated the radiation doses of all investigations by a smaller margin in 2010 compared to 2003 (i.e., more accurately), with only one exception: CT of the abdomen. CONCLUSION: Despite evidence of some improvement, doctors of all grades still have a very poor knowledge of radiation exposure even with the most common investigations. The worsening appreciation of the radiation involved in CT scanning is especially worrying considering its increasing use in practice today.",Excluded
744,"Optimal scan parameters for ct fluoroscopy in lung interventional radiologic procedures: Relationship between radiation dose and image quality. Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between radiation doses and lung computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic scan parameters and to determine optimal scan parameters for performance of lung interventional radiologic (IR) procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this prospective study, which included 32 patients with a single lung tumor;written informed consent was obtained. CT fluoroscopic images were obtained with three tube voltages (80,120,135 kV) and three tube currents (10, 20, 30 mA) in each patient. The signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs) and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured quantitatively. To evaluate the feasibility of performing lung IR procedures, four readers visually scored the image quality. Acceptable CT fluoroscopic images were determined by using agreement of at least three of the four readers. The weighted CT dose index for each CT scan parameter was measured. A piecewise linear regression equation was obtained from the relationship between radiation doses and visual image scores. Result(s): Both the SNR and the CNR improved as the radiation dose increased, leading to improvement in the image quality. Acceptable image quality was achieved in 94% (30 of 32) of patients when the radiation dose was 1.18 mGy/sec (120 kV, 10 mA) and in all patients when it was greater than 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). The piecewise linear curve showed rapid improvement in image quality until the radiation dose increased to 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). When the radiation dose was increased greater than 1.48 mGy/sec, improvement in the image quality became more gradual. Conclusion(s): Results of this study can be used to guide the determination of optimal scan parameters in lung CT fluoroscopy. © RSNA, 2010.",Excluded

In Japan, a robotic-assisted PCI (R-PCI) system, the CorPath GRX System (Corindus Inc.), has been approved for clinical use in 2018, which is the first introduction of R-PCI into Japan. In this study, the clinical performance of the R-PCI system in the initial year at Kurume University Hospital was evaluated comparing with conventional manual PCI (M-PCI). A total of 30 R-PCI and 77 M-PCI procedures performed between April 2019 and March 2020, were retrospectively included. The primary outcome was the rate of clinical success defined as < 30% residual stenosis without in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The secondary outcomes were fluoroscopy time, dose area product (DAP), amount of radiation exposure to operators and assistants, procedural time, and contrast volume. Propensity-matching technique was used to match each R-PCI lesion to the nearest M-PCI lesion without replacement. After propensity score matching, 30 R-PCI procedures in 28 patients and 37 M-PCI procedures in 35 patients were analyzed. Clinical success rate with R-PCI was favorable and comparable to M-PCI (93.3 vs. 94.6%, p = 0.97), without any in-hospital MACE. The operator radiation exposure was significantly lower in R-PCI (0 vs. 24.5 microSV, p < 0.0001). Radiation exposure to the patients was tended to be reduced by R-PCI (DAP: 77.6 vs. 100.2 Gycm2, p = 0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in radiation exposure to the assistant, fluoroscopy time, procedural time and contrast volume between the two groups (radiation exposure to the assistant: 10.5 vs. 10.0 microSV, p = 0.64, fluoroscopy time: 27.5 vs. 30.1 min, p = 0.55, procedural time: 72.4 vs. 61.6 min, p = 0.23, and contrast volume: 93.2 vs. 102.0 ml, p = 0.36).

Background and purpose: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) can be performed without reactors due to development of cyclotron-based epithermal neutron source (C-BENS), which is optimized for treatment for deeper-seated tumors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of cyclotron-based BNCT with borofalan (10B) for recurrent or locally advanced head and neck cancer. Material(s) and Method(s): In this open-label, phase II JHN002 trial of BNCT using C-BENS with borofalan (10B), patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma (R-SCC) or with recurrent/locally advanced non-squamous cell carcinoma (R/LA-nSCC) of the head and neck were intravenously administered 400 mg/kg borofalan (10B), followed by neutron irradiation. The tumor dose was determined passively as the mucosal maximum dose of 12 Gy-Eq. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Post-trial observational JHN002 Look Up study was planned for evaluating locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS). Result(s): Eight R-SCC and 13 R/LA-nSCC patients were enrolled. All R-SCC patients had prior radiotherapy with a median dose of 65.5 Gy (range, 59.4-76.0 Gy). The ORR for all patients was 71%, and complete response/partial response were 50%/25% in R-SCC and 8%/62% in R/LA-nSCC. The 2-year overall survival for R-SCC and R/LA-nSCC were 58% and 100%, respectively. The median LRPFS was 11.5 months for R-SCC. Frequently observed adverse events included alopecia (95%), hyperamylasemia (86%), and nausea (81%). Conclusion(s): These data suggest that BNCT using C-BENS with borofalan (10B) is a promising treatment option for patients with R-SCC or R/LA-nSCC of the head and neck.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded

The exposed group was divided into a subgroup with 65 individuals moderately exposed (39 men and 26 women) and a highly exposed subgroup consisted of 19 men. The statistical analysis of the comet assay results showed that there were no significant differences in basal DNA damage between pesticide-exposed workers and the control group nor between moderately and highly exposed ones. In addition, exposure of peripheral blood lymphocytes to hydrogen peroxide or gamma-irradiation led to a similar degree of DNA damage and subsequent repair for all the studied populations.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal biologically equivalent dose (BED) for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) by comparing local control rates in proportion to various total doses and fractionation schedules. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-four patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer and a single metastatic lung tumor were included in this study. Differences in local control rates were evaluated according to gender, primary tumor site, response, tumor size, and BED. For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded

Purpose: It is unclear whether adding concurrent chemotherapy (CT) to definitive radiotherapy (RT) following induction CT is a tolerable and cost effective treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged 70 years or older with comorbidities. This study evaluated the actual clinical outcomes between concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and RT alone following induction CT or not in patients (>=70 years) in a single institution's clinical practice. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 82 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Their treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRR), treatment toxicities and distant metastasis (DM) were evaluated. Early mortality rates were also evaluated as 4-month mortality after RT. Result(s): Fifty-four patients received CCRT and 28 patients received RT alone. Induction CT before RT was performed for 68.5% and 50.0% in CCRT and RT alone groups. Treatment tolerance was significantly worse in CCRT (p = 0.046). The median survival was 21.1 and 18.1 months for CCRT and RT alone, which was not statistically significant. LRR and DM were also not different. Most early deaths after CCRT were attributed to non-cancer-related mortality. Acute esophagitis of grade >=2 occurred more following CCRT (p = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of >=5 and a weight loss of >=5% after RT were associated with poor OS. The factors adversely affecting 4-month survival were a CCI of >=5 and CCRT. Conclusion(s): There were no significant differences in OS, LRR, and DM between CCRT and RT alone treatment in elderly patients. However, there was a poorer tolerance and higher incidence of acute esophagitis in the CCRT group. Specifically, when the patients had a CCI of >=5, RT alone seems to be reasonable with a low probability of early death.Copyright © 2019. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded

We retrospectively analyzed 93 RT treatments in 63 patients with CIEDs. Patients were treated with 3D conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT and stereotactic RT. We collected clinical characteristics of cancer, models of CIEDs, total RT dose to tumor and radiation energy. Radiation dose delivered to CIED and its dysfunctions after RT was evaluated. Subgroup analysis of 48 RT treatments (32 patients) on chest and neck plus on 13 RT treatments (12 patients) with 18 MV neutron-producing photon energy considered as high risk was performed. The number of treatments of patients with CIEDs increased from 0.3% in 2011 to 1.2% in 2016. Two patients, treated with 18 MV photon beam, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that received a maximum dose of around 2.1 Gy, experienced adverse events: a reprogramming of ICD when the patient reached a delivered dose to the tumor of 32 Gy, and an altered sensing function requiring replacement after 11 months from the end of RT. Nearly 2% of patients with CIEDs from high-risk patients subgroup had experienced a damage of the device.

BACKGROUND: The risk of proximal humerus fractures increases with age and deterioration of bone quality over time, and the treatment of these injuries may be clinically challenging.The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between local bone quality and the morphology of proximal humerus fractures. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 187 patients diagnosed with proximal humerus fractures. X-ray images of all patients were analysed, and on this basis, bone quality was assessed, using the Deltoid Tuberosity Index (DTI), average cortical bone thickness (CBTavg) and the Tingart measurement. The type of fracture was classified according to Neer's and Association for Osteosynthesis (AO) classifications. Moreover, the caput-collum-diaphyseal (CCD) angle was measured and the relationships between valgus or varus fractures and the DTI, CBTAVG and Tingart parameters were investigated in all patients. RESULT(S): Using the Neer classification, the most common fracture type was type 3, found in 90 patients (48.1%). A total of 51 patients (27.3%) sustained an AO B1 fracture. Significantly lower mean DTI values were noted in patients with a Neer 4 fracture compared to those with Neer 3 (p = 0.02) and Neer 2 fractures (p = 0.03). Moreover, significantly higher mean DTI (p <0.00) and CBTAVG (p <0.025) values were noted in the group of patients with valgus fractures (CCD> 140). CONCLUSION(S): 1.

1504,"Lhermitte's sign following head and neck radiotherapy. Lhermitte's sign is an uncommon sequel of radiotherapy to the cervical spinal cord. Although the exact mechanism underlying its occurrence remains unclear; it is felt to be the result of a temporary interference with the turnover and synthesis of myelin, leading to focal demyelination. We have undertaken a detailed analysis of the radiation delivered to four patients who developed the sign after irradiation for malignancies of the head and neck. Our data support the view that radiation dose is crucial to its development, but calculations using the linear-quadratic radiobiological model raise interesting questions regarding the dose-response relationship. In particular, we find that calculations of biologically effective doses are predictive of a late rather than an early normal tissue response. The onset of symptoms after irradiation was apparent in all four patients within 4 months, with resolution in all being complete within a further 6 months: The recognition of this benign transient form of radiation-induced paraesthesia and its differentiation from the later onset, progressive and unremitting symptoms associated with radiation myelopathy is essential in reassuring patients undergoing head and neck irradiation.",Excluded

PURPOSE: To demonstrate superiority of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg compared to focal and peripheral laser treatment in patients with radiation retinopathy for choroidal melanoma., METHODS: Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with radiation retinopathy and visual acuity impairment due to radiation maculopathy accessible for laser therapy, age >= 18 years, and BCVA less than 20/32. The main objective was to study the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) over 6 months from ranibizumab 0.5 mg (experimental) compared to focal laser of the macula and panretinal laser treatment of the ischemic retina (control) in patients with radiation retinopathy in choroidal melanoma. The secondary objectives of the radiation retinopathy study were to compare functional and anatomical results between ranibizumab and laser group over 12 months and to measure the frequency of vitreous hemorrhage and rubeosis iridis., RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis included 31 patients assigned to ranibizumab (n = 15) or laser treatment (n = 16). In terms of BCVA at month 6, ranibizumab was superior to laser treatment, with an advantage of 0.14 logMAR, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.25, p = 0.030. The positive effect of ranibizumab disappeared after treatment was discontinued. Similar results without statistically significant difference were found with respect to macular thickness. In both groups, no change was observed at month 6 in the size of ischemia in the macula or periphery compared to baseline. There was 1 case of vitreous hemorrhage in the laser group and no case of rubeosis iridis over time., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and clear superiority of ranibizumab compared to laser treatment up to 26 weeks, but this effect disappeared at week 52 after completion of intravitreal treatment.

OS differences remained significant when stratified according to HPV status (HPV-positive p = 0.011; HPV-negative p = 0.003). Freedom from any recurrence (FFR), locoregional control (LRC) and freedom of distant recurrence (FDR) were better in those with NLR < 3. The negative impact of elevated pre-RT NLR on OS (HR = 1.64, p = 0.001), FFR (HR = 1.6, p = 0.006) and LRC (HR = 1.8, p = 0.005) remained significant on multivariable analysis. Conclusion(s): Pre-RT NLR is an independent prognostic factor in patients with oropharyngeal cancer regardless of HPV status. Patients with lower NLR had more favourable OS and disease control.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Cancer Research UK.",Excluded
307,"Waiting times for radiotherapy: variation over time and between cancer networks in southeast England. The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the length of time that patients with cancer wait from diagnosis to treatment with radiotherapy. A total of 57,426 men and 71,018 women diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2001 and receiving radiotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry database. In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%. There was no difference between male and female patients after adjustment for the other factors, particularly site. There was a highly significant trend over time: the median wait increased from 45 days in 1992 to 76 days in 2001, while the adjusted proportion being treated within 60 days declined by almost a half, from 64 to 35%, over the same period.",Excluded
1843,"The degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs negatively influence union rate of osteoporotic vertebral fracture: A multicenter cohort study. Background: With the increasing aging population in developed countries, there has been an associated increased prevalence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). Many previous reports have attempted to predict the risk of delayed union associated with OVF. However, the role of endplate failure and the degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs, and their association with delayed union has received little attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the endplate fracture and disc degeneration rank as risk factors for delayed union. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with fresh OVF were enrolled in the study. MRI and X-ray were performed at the time of enrollment and at the 6 months follow-up. The MR images were used to assess the degeneration grade of adjacent intervertebral discs (using the modified Pfirrmann grading system), and endplate failure. Supine and weight-bearing radiographs were used to define angular motion and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral body wall. Result(s): A total of 139 patients (112 female, 27 male) completed the 6 month follow-up (a 65.1% follow-up rate). The study revealed 27 cases of delayed union (19.4%). A healthier adjacent caudal disc with low grade degeneration was found to be associated with an increased risk of delayed union (P = 0.008). Bi-endplate injury and significant compression of the anterior vertebral body wall were significantly associated with delayed union (P = 0.019, and P = 0.001 respectively). Rapid progression of the adjacent cranial disc degeneration was observed at the end of the 6 month follow-up period (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Modified Pfirrmann grading system revealed that a healthier adjacent intervertebral disc at the caudal level and bi-endplate fracture were significantly associated with an increased risk of delayed union. These findings may influence the management strategy for patients with OVF.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
3525,"Potential Irish dose reference levels for cardiac interventional examinations. Collective dose for cardio-angiography studies is the highest of all non-CT radiological investigations. Deterministic effects such as erythema, epilation and ulceration being reported on patients who have undergone these procedures emphasise the importance of optimising radiation dose, whilst not compromising diagnostic efficacy. This study investigated radiation doses delivered to patients for four common types of cardiac radiological examinations: coronary angiography (CA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary angiograms (which were followed by an interventional procedure (CA-PCI)) and permanent pacemaker insertions (PPIs). 21 cardiac imaging suites participated in the study in 14 hospitals, representing 90% of relevant centres within Ireland. Radiation dose was monitored for 1804 adult patients using dose-area product meters. Operational and examination details, such as cardiologist grade, patient details, examination complexity and exposure factors, were recorded for each examination. Variation factors in dose between centres ranged from 2.7 to 11.1, but these factors were not higher than intrahospital variations previously recorded for other examinations within Ireland, such as chest X-ray. High-dose centres were often associated with long screening times, a high patient body mass index and complexity of the procedure. Preliminary dose reference levels (DRLs) were established using rounded third quartile values at 4200 cGy cm(2), 8400 cGy cm(2), 10,700 cGy cm(2) and 2100 cGy cm(2) for CA, PCI, CA-PCI and PPI, respectively. With these commonly performed relatively high-dose procedures, it is important that some guideline values are available to encourage optimised strategies. These proposed DRLs offer such guidance.",Excluded
1400,"Allogeneic stem cell transplantation after autologous SCT for primary mediastinal b cell lymphoma in the rituximab era: A retrospective study by the EBMT lymphoma working party. Introduction: Evidence from the DLBCL setting suggests that allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is a reasonable salvage therapy for patients progressing despite undergoing autologous SCT (autoSCT and even as an alternative to autoSCT. Data regarding the effects of alloSCT in patients with primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma (PMBCL) are very limited. The objective of the current study was to investigate the outcome of alloSCT in patients with PMBCL who were previously treated with rituximab-based regimens and autoSCT. Materials (or patients) and Methods: All EBMT registered patients diagnosed with PMBCL who had undergone alloSCT between 2001 and 2011 as second transplant after a previous autoSCT were eligible. Patient characteristics, disease- and transplant-related data were collected from MED-A forms. Centers with potentially eligible patients were contacted to provide additional treatment and follow-up information, including a written histopathology report. Result(s): 12 patients, 5 females (42%) and 7 males with confirmed PMBCL, were included. The median age was 27 years, ranging from 21-to 61 years. Median time from diagnosis to alloSCT and from autoSCT to alloSCT were 14 (IQR 11-17 months and 7 months (IQR 4-9) respectively. Fifty-eight percent (N=7) had received at least 3 chemotherapeutic regimens prior allograft; 11 (92%) had been treated with rituximab-containing regimen and 67% (N=8) received mediastinal irradiation prior allosct. Evaluation of disease status at transplantation revealed that 42% (n=5) were in CR1/PR1 (alloSCT was performed here as part of a tandem transplant program), 17% (n=2) were in CR/PR>1 and 42% (n=5) were transplanted with refractory disease. 50% (n=6) were transplanted with residual mediastinal mass larger than 5 cm. Within a median follow up of 36 months, only 3 patients remained alive, whereas 9 patients died due to disease progression (n=3) or non-relapse mortality (n=6). Discussion(s): The current preliminary study does not suggest that alloSCT for PMBCL in the rituximab era can benefit a large proportion of patients. Larger studies are warranted to further define the role of allograft in this specific indication.",Excluded
1861,"Therapy-related myelodysplasia and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia after high-dose therapy with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support for lymphoid malignancies. Purpose: To evaluate the incidence of and risk factors for therapy- related myelodysplasia (tMDS) and secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML), after high-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous bone marrow or peripheral-blood progenitor-cell support, in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and Methods: Between January 1985 and November 1996, 230 patients underwent HDT comprising cyclophosphamide therapy and total-body irradiation, with autologous hematopoietic progenitor-cell support, as consolidation of remission. With a median follow-up of 6 years, 27 (12%) developed tMDS or sAML. Result(s): Median time to development of tMDS or sAML was 4.4 years (range, 11 months to 8.8 years) after HDT. Karyotyping (performed in 24 cases) at diagnosis of tMDS or sAML revealed complex karyotypes in 18 patients. Seventeen patients had monosomy 5/5q-, 15 had - 7/7q-, seven had -18/18q-, seven had -13/13q-, and four had -20/20q-. Twenty- one patients died from complications of tMDS or sAML or treatment for tMDS or sAML, at a median of 10 months (range, 0 to 26 months). Sixteen died without evidence of recurrent lymphoma. Six patients were alive at a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 2 to 22 months) after diagnosis of tMDS or sAML. On multivariate analysis, prior fludarabine therapy (P = .009) and older age (P = .02) were associated with the development of tMDS or sAML. Increased interval from diagnosis to HDT and bone marrow involvement at diagnosis were of borderline significance (P = .05 and .07, respectively). Conclusion(s): tMDS and sAML are serious complications of HDT for NHL and are associated with very poor prognosis. Alternative strategies for reducing their incidence and for treatment are needed.

3674,"Evaluation of upper gastrointestinal symptoms and effect of different modalities of treatment in patients of chronic kidney disease. Introduction: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) present with various clinical gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and abnormalities in the GI tract. Studies on non-dialysed patients are very few and there is no Indian study to see the effect of yoga in these symptoms. This study was planned to evaluate upper GI symptoms in patients of CKD and evaluate the effects of haemodialysis, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), and yoga on these symptoms. Material(s) and Method(s): The present study included 100 patients, of which 75 were patients of CKD with upper GI symptoms and 25 patients with upper GI symptoms without CKD served as controls. 75 cases of CKD were further subdivided into 3 groups - A, B, and C - to see effect of twice weekly haemodialysis, PPIs, and yoga, respectively at the end of 3 months. All cases were interviewed to obtain information regarding GI symptoms, and endoscopy was performed at the beginning and at the end of 3 months. Result(s): In this prospective study, there were 66 males and 34 females. Nausea (93%), vomiting (57%), and anorexia (65%) were the most common symptoms; and erosive gastritis (21%) and hiatus hernia (15%) were the most common endoscopic findings in CKD patients. Effect of adequate haemodialysis caused reversal of both symptoms and endoscopic findings, whereas effect of PPIs and yoga had only symptomatic relief but no pathological change as the endoscopic findings remained unchanged due to continued presence of uraemic toxins. Conclusion(s): Patients of chronic kidney disease frequently develop different GI symptoms and GI lesions. There was reversal of upper GI symptoms and endoscopic abnormality following adequate haemodialysis therapy. Persistence of endoscopic abnormality suggests that the improvement was not complete due to continued presence of uraemic toxins in non-dialysed patients.Copyright © 2014 Indian Academy of Clinical Medicine.

A total of 200 radiographs were reviewed of 49 patients below the age of 45 years. Full coverage was achieved in only 36% of cases. Amongst females, only 22% received adequate shielding. None of the patients in their reproductive years (16-45 years) had gonad shields. The reasons for inadequate coverage were, in order of frequency: (i) no shielding was used; (ii) malposition of the shielding device, and (iii) the use of inappropriately shaped or sized devices.

889,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours. Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded

Background:Most patients with glioblastoma are older than 60 years, but treatment guidelines are based on trials in patients aged only up to 70 years. We did this trial to assess the impact of short schedule radiotherapy in patients aged 60 years and older with glioblastoma. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients aged 60 years or older with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) greater than or equal to 70 were treated with postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (34Gy administered in 3.4Gy fractions over 2 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, and tolerance to treatment. Result(s): The median age at surgery was 71 years (range 60-81). No patient received prior or concomitant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, the median progressionfree survival and overall survival were 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.9) and 10 months (95% CI, 8.9-11.1) respectively. Type of surgery (total resection vs. subtotal vs. biopsy) remained a prognostic factor (p=0.034). Tolerance appeared acceptable in terms of KPS changes and corticosteroid use during radiation therapy. Conclusion(s): These results support the efficacy and safety of an abbreviated schedule of radiotherapy for GBM in elderly patients.",Excluded

The effect of preoperative radio chemotherapy on lymphatic drainage and intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection has yet not been investigated. In this study, we study 13 patients with SCC. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging of the patients was performed using SPECT-CT. Special care was taken to use identical injection sites for both studies. Imaging comprised planar and SPECT, iterative reconstruction and were viewed with the co-registered CT image. The results were validated by comparison with the histological results of intraoperative gamma probe detection and histology of the completed neck dissection. Identical SLNs were found in 6/13 patients. In 2/13 cases SLN biopsies were false-negative. In 4/13 patients preoperative SLN imaging identified more/additional nodes than the initial imaging, whereas fewer nodes were seen in 3/13 patients. Neither the primary tumor site nor the TNM stage was predictive for changes in the lymphatic drainage pattern. No constant effect of irradiation could be demonstrated. Preoperative radio chemotherapy has an unpredictable influence on the lymphatic drainage pattern in HNSCC. Consequently, the intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection after radio chemotherapy does not reveal the SLN of carcinogenesis. Thus, we advise fused functional/anatomical imaging (SPECT-CT) before and after radiochemotherapy if the SLN concept is utilized in HNSCC.",Excluded
634,"Interaural intensity difference and ear advantage in listening to dichotic consonant-vowel syllable pairs. The right-ear advantage (REA) is typically observed in verbal dichotic listening, indicating a left hemisphere superiority for speech processing. The REA could be thought of as a bottom-up, stimulus-driven laterality effect, caused by the preponderance of the contralateral neural fibers from the right ear to the auditory/speech processing areas in the left temporal lobe. The REA can, however, be modified by explicitly requiring the listeners to focus their attention alternatively on the left or right-ear stimuli, thus either countering or enhancing the bottom-up processes through top-down attentional control. In the present study, we manipulated the strength of the bottom-up REA by inducing an intensity difference between the right-ear and left-ear speech inputs in order to make the REA either weaker (left-ear input>right-ear input) or stronger (left-ear input<right-ear input) and also examined how this manipulation affected the top-down attention modulation effects. Twenty healthy participants listened to dichotic presentations of consonant-vowel syllable pairs with different attention instructions. The results showed that the interaural intensity difference significantly affected the ear advantage in the predicted way. It also interacted with the top-down control effects, attentional control having a stronger effect when attending to the ear that had a weaker sound intensity, as compared to when the intensities were equal.",Excluded
1526,"Optimized radioiodine therapy of Graves' disease: Analysis of the delivered dose and of other possible factors affecting outcome. The best approach to radioiodine dose selection in the treatment of Graves' hyperthyroidism remains highly controversial. The formula to calculate the individual dose of 131I to be delivered has been used for half a century and takes into account the thyroid mass, the effective half- life and the maximum uptake of 131I. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of this formula by determining the relationship between the administered dose of 131I calculated to deliver a target dose of 50 Gy to the thyroid and the actual exact organ dose. We further analyzed if therapeutic success, defined by euthyroidism following the individually calculated dose, can be predicted by different pretreatment parameters and particularly by organ dose. One hundred patients with a first episode of Graves' disease and who had received optimal thyroid irradiation after precise dosimetry were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were categorized according to their thyroid function (plasma free thyroxine (T4) serum concentration) as eu-, hyper- or hypothyroid during and 1 year after treatment. The relationship between the administered dose and organ dose was assessed by simple regression. We compared free T4, free tri-iodothyronine, thyroid weight, the number of patients with antithyroperoxidase antibodies and TSH receptor autoantibodies. 24 h urinary iodine excretion, 131I uptake, and the exact dose of 131I delivered to the thyroid as pretreatment variables. Although we found a correlation between administered dose (mCi) and organ dose (Gy) (r = 0.3, P = 0.003), the mean coefficient of variation for organ dose was 45%. Individualized radioiodine therapy enabled euthyroidism in 26% of patients and failed in 74% of patients (33% had persistent or recurrent hyperthyroidism and 41% permanent hypothyroidism). 131I uptake was significantly higher in the hyperthyroidism group in comparison with the euthyroid group. However, organ dose and other pretreatment variables did not differ among the three groups. In conclusion, these results confirm the low performance of individual dosimetry using what are established ratios, since the delivered dose to the gland, although correlated to the intended dose, is highly variable. The finding that other usual pretreatment variables are not different between groups, gives little hope for improving the way of calculating the ideal dose of radioiodine. We suggest to those not yet ready to give a standard or an ablative dose for Graves' hyperthyroidism that they abandon this way to calculate the 131I dose.",Excluded
114,"Non-myeloablative busulfan chimeric mouse models are less pro-inflammatory than head-shielded irradiation for studying immune cell interactions in brain tumours. Background: Chimeric mouse models generated via adoptive bone marrow transfer are the foundation for immune cell tracking in neuroinflammation. Chimeras that exhibit low chimerism levels, blood-brain barrier disruption and pro-inflammatory effects prior to the progression of the pathological phenotype, make it difficult to distinguish the role of immune cells in neuroinflammatory conditions. Head-shielded irradiation overcomes many of the issues described and replaces the recipient bone marrow system with donor haematopoietic cells expressing a reporter gene or different pan-leukocyte antigen, whilst leaving the blood-brain barrier intact. However, our previous work with full body irradiation suggests that this may generate a pro-inflammatory peripheral environment which could impact on the brain's immune microenvironment. Our aim was to compare non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning against head-shielded irradiation bone marrow chimeras prior to implantation of glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumour with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Method(s): Recipient wild-type/CD45.1 mice received non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning (25 mg/kg), full intensity head-shielded irradiation, full intensity busulfan conditioning (125 mg/kg) prior to transplant with whole bone marrow from CD45.2 donors and were compared against untransplanted controls. Half the mice from each group were orthotopically implanted with syngeneic GL-261 glioblastoma cells. We assessed peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen chimerism, multi-organ pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles at 12 weeks and brain chimerism and immune cell infiltration by whole brain flow cytometry before and after implantation of glioblastoma at 12 and 14 weeks respectively. Result(s): Both non-myeloablative conditioning and head-shielded irradiation achieve equivalent blood and spleen chimerism of approximately 80%, although bone marrow engraftment is higher in the head-shielded irradiation group and highest in the fully conditioned group. Head-shielded irradiation stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood and spleen but not in the brain, suggesting a systemic response to irradiation, whilst non-myeloablative conditioning showed no cytokine elevation. Non-myeloablative conditioning achieved higher donor chimerism in the brain after glioblastoma implantation than head-shielded irradiation with an altered immune cell profile. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that non-myeloablative conditioning generates a more homeostatic peripheral inflammatory environment than head-shielded irradiation to allow a more consistent evaluation of immune cells in glioblastoma and can be used to investigate the roles of peripheral immune cells and bone marrow-derived subsets in other neurological diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded

Objective: To assess the advantages of Adaptive Iterative Dose Reduction using Three Dimensional Processing (AIDR3D) for image quality improvement and dose reduction for chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): Institutional Review Boards approved this study and informed consent was obtained. Eighty-eight subjects underwent chest CT at five institutions using identical scanners and protocols. During a single visit, each subject was scanned using different tube currents: 240, 120, and 60 mA. Scan data were converted to images using AIDR3D and a conventional reconstruction mode (without AIDR3D). Using a 5-point scale from 1 (non-diagnostic) to 5 (excellent), three blinded observers independently evaluated image quality for three lung zones, four patterns of lung disease (nodule/mass, emphysema, bronchiolitis, and diffuse lung disease), and three mediastinal measurements (small structure visibility, streak artifacts, and shoulder artifacts). Differences in these scores were assessed by Scheffe's test. Result(s): At each tube current, scans using AIDR3D had higher scores than those without AIDR3D, which were significant for lung zones (p<0.0001) and all mediastinal measurements (p<0.01). For lung diseases, significant improvements with AIDR3D were frequently observed at 120 and 60 mA. Scans with AIDR3D at 120 mA had significantly higher scores than those without AIDR3D at 240 mA for lung zones and mediastinal streak artifacts (p<0.0001), and slightly higher or equal scores for all other measurements. Scans with AIDR3D at 60 mA were also judged superior or equivalent to those without AIDR3D at 120 mA.

741,"Late gastrointestinal complications after pelvic radiotherapy: radiation enteritis. INTRODUCTION: Radiation enteritis is a complication of radiation therapy for pelvic tumours. It appears after a variable period of time and is often progressive. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyse our experience of 77 cases (52 females and 25 males) diagnosed with radiation enteritis or proctitis between 1986 and 2006. RESULT(S): The most frequent location of radiation injury is ileum (55 patients, 71%), followed by rectum (22 patients, 28%). Twenty-eight patients (36%) were medically managed and 49 (64%) required surgical treatment. In 41 (53%) of the patients the affected region was resected, in 5 (7%) a by-pass was performed and in 3 (4%) a terminal colostomy. Surgical mortality was 4% (3 cases) and the complication rate 9% (7 cases). Twelve patients (16%) presented recurrence of radiation-related illness. Excluding those cases deceased because of tumoral progression, 5-year survival rate was 90% and 10-year survival rate 83%. CONCLUSION(S): Radiation enteritis must be initially conservatively managed, but in those cases without response, surgery is indicated. Surgical treatment should not be delayed fearing postoperative complications, which are more susceptible to appear in deteriorated patients. If technically possible, the affected region should be resected, because complications may appear later at this damaged location.",Excluded

Aim: To evaluate the efficacy of concurrent oral capecitabine with accelerated hypofractionated radical radiotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach. Capecitabine as targeted therapy given with each fraction of radiotherapy and administered orally may have significant advantages over intravenous, 3 weekly cisplatin. © 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded
2823,"Experience with higher doses of radiotherapy in the postoperative treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: A single institutional report. Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly aggressive tumour with median survival of approximately 14 months. Management consists of maximal surgical resection followed by postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent then adjuvant temozolamide. The standard radiotherapy dose is 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Most tumour recurrences occur within the previous irradiation field. Regimens designed to deliver higher radiation dose to improve local control and enhance survival warrant investigation. Method(s): We report a single institutional experience of treatment of consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme, treated with resection, postoperative radiotherapy followed by concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Finding(s): Of the 80 patients who entered the study, 68 completed the treatment course; there were 45 (66.2 %) male and 23 (33.8%) female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.97 +/- 12.85 (21-75) years. At a median follow up of 19 months, 39 (57.3%) patients had evidence of tumour progression and 36 (52.9%) patients had died. Median overall survival for all patients was 16 months and progression-free survival for all patients was 6.02 months. All potential prognostic factors were analysed to evaluate their effects on overall survival. age of 50 years or younger, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, and extent of surgery were significant. We noted a lower progression rate among patients who received higher doses of radiotherapy (>60 Gy; p = 0.03). Overall survival was also increased, but this was not significant.

1374,"PHD3-dependent hydroxylation of HCLK2 promotes the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex regulatory network that is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Posttranslational modifications are widely used to ensure strict spatiotemporal control of signal flow, but how the DDR responds to environmental cues, such as changes in ambient oxygen tension, remains poorly understood. We found that an essential component of the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, the human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans biological clock protein CLK-2 (HCLK2), associated with and was hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 3 (PHD3). HCLK2 hydroxylation was necessary for its interaction with ATR and the subsequent activation of ATR/CHK1/p53. Inhibiting PHD3, either with the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) or through hypoxia, prevented activation of the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway and decreased apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Consistent with these observations, we found that mice lacking PHD3 were resistant to the effects of ionizing radiation and had decreased thymic apoptosis, a biomarker of genomic integrity. Our identification of HCLK2 as a substrate of PHD3 reveals the mechanism through which hypoxia inhibits the DDR, suggesting hydroxylation of HCLK2 is a potential therapeutic target for regulating the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway.",Excluded

During an examination period of one year in a well defined population of 50 000 inhabitants 44 patients with colitis ulcerosa were diagnostically clarified and secured histologically. 37 patients (84.1%) could be treated and brought into a phase of remission with salazosulfapyridin (Azulfidine), glucocorticoids as well as a liberal gastroenterologic basic diet with restriction on dairy products and occasionally a diet, developed for astronauts. Only 7 patients (15.9%) had to be hospitalized for therapy because of accompanying illnesses, regression in the course of colitis and complications such as anemia and electrolyte imbalances. With view to the degree of severity, the majority of the patients showed signs of erosive and ulcerative changes as well as expanded pseudopolypic formations in the mucous membrane indicating the chronically continuing and chronically relapsing course of the disease. 54.5% of the affected showed endoscopical and histological changes in the rectosigmoid; an additional 27.2? had inflammatory changes up to the left colon flexure (see figure 2). Only 18.3% of the patients showed inflammatory attack of the entire colon. From the degree of severity of the inflammatory changes, the anatomic distribution and expansion in the large bowel, no difference in outpatient therapy with regard to its effectiveness can be seen.",Excluded
948,"Local control in sinonasal malignant melanoma: Comparing conventional to hypofractionated radiotherapy. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of fractionation schedule on local control in postoperative radiotherapy (RT) for sinonasal malignant melanoma., METHODS: Sixty-three patients who were treated with surgery and postoperative RT in 4 accredited head and neck cancer centers in the Netherlands between 1998 and 2013 were retrospectively studied. Outcomes with conventional fractionation (2-2.4 Gy per fraction; n = 27) were compared to hypofractionation (4-6 Gy per fraction; n = 36). The primary endpoint was local control and the secondary endpoint was toxicity., RESULTS: Comparable local control rates were found after 2 and 5 years (63% vs 64% and 47% vs 53%; P = .73 for, respectively, conventional fractionation vs hypofractionation). Local recurrences were predominantly present ipsilateral (92%) and within the irradiated volume (88%). Late toxicity grade >= 3 was observed in 2 of 63 patients, 1 patient in both groups., CONCLUSION: Radiotherapy fractionation schedule did not influence the local control rate or the incidence of late toxicity in patients treated with surgery and RT for sinonasal malignant melanoma in this retrospective analysis. Due to this retrospective nature and the limited number of patients, strong recommendations cannot be made. Expected toxicity, patient convenience, and workload may be taken into account for the choice of fractionation schedule until conclusive evidence becomes available.

1605,"The small molecule drug CBL0137 increases the level of DNA damage and the efficacy of radiotherapy for glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable brain tumor with inevitable recurrence. This is in part due to a highly malignant cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation of tumor cells that is particularly resistant to conventional treatments, including radiotherapy. Here we show that CBL0137, a small molecule anti-cancer agent, sensitizes GBM CSCs to radiotherapy. CBL0137 sequesters the FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex to chromatin, resulting in cytotoxicity preferentially within tumor cells. We show that when combined with radiotherapy, CBL0137 inhibited GBM CSC growth and resulted in more DNA damage in the CSCs compared to irradiation or drug alone. Using an in vivo subcutaneous model, we showed that the frequency of GBM CSCs was reduced when tumors were pretreated with CBL0137 and then exposed to irradiation. Survival studies with orthotopic GBM models resulted in significantly extended survival for mice treated with combinatorial therapy. As GBM CSCs contribute to the inevitable recurrence in patients, targeting them is imperative. This work establishes a new treatment paradigm for GBM that sensitizes CSCs to irradiation and may ultimately reduce tumor recurrence.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
381,"Case report: Asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective high energy therapy in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and left ventricular assist device. BACKGROUND We present a case of asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective defibrillation in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Heart Mate III. Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare, congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal embryogenesis of myocardium with characteristic multiple trabeculations in ventricular apex. Its lethal character comes from frequent ventricular arrhythmias, often also with atrio ventricular conduction block. The main role of treatment is to improve cardiac efficiency, reduce the risk of arrhythmias, implant of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death, ventricular assist device and heart transplant in cases of serious heart failure. CASE REPORT 61 year old patient with severe heart failure (LVEF 16%), diagnosed in 2012. In the course of non compaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation function in February 2018 and implantation left ventricular mechanical cardiac assistant LVAD with Heart Mate III system on 27.06.2019. The patient had 5 discharges of the device in a church without loss of consciousness and symptoms of apparent circulatory failure on 27.10.2019. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department in fair general condition, with basal crepitations over the lungs audible, slight dyspnea at rest, with ongoing Torsade de pointes in electrocardiographic examination, with ventricular rate 300/min, and blood pressure 100/60 Hg mm. Ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by external defibrillator, achieving sinus rhythm return. Basic examination results showed elevated proBNP values (4362 ng/l), features of pulmonary stasis on X ray. CRT D device memory showed 5 unsuccessful discharges of the device, followed by external effective defibrillation after exhausting all available high energy therapies, which restored sinus rhythm and synchronous biventricular stimulation. The patient was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Ineffective high energy therapy in many cases ends in death. In this case, despite the abnormal electrical heart rate, LVAD was working correctly and ensured proper cardiovascular function.",Excluded
673,"Short-course preoperative radiotherapy with delayed surgery in rectal cancer - a retrospective study. PURPOSE: In the most advanced, non-resectable primary rectal cancers, conventional long-course radiotherapy (RT) (1.8-2Gyx25-28), frequently combined with chemotherapy, has been used since tumour regression is needed in order to allow a radical (R0) resection. In Uppsala, short-course 5x5Gy with planned delayed surgery has been used in patients with contraindications to long-course RT (+/-chemotherapy). The aim is to describe our experience of using this approach in patients not eligible for standard treatment., PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 2002 and 2005, 46 patients with non-resectable rectal cancer (+/-synchronous distant metastases) were treated with 5x5Gy and delayed surgery if possible. The clinical records were retrospectively evaluated. The first group (A) had no metastases (T4NXM0), whereas the other two groups (B+C) had metastases (T4NXM1). In group (B), the patients had predominantly loco-regional disease and were not candidates for combination chemotherapy (high age, co-morbidities), and in group (C) up-front combination chemotherapy was given, with the intention to have surgery of both the primary and the secondaries if sufficient regression at both sites were seen., RESULTS: The patients in the first two groups (A+B) were old (median 79 and 76 years, respectively), and had several co-morbidities. In group (C), median age was 63 years. The 5x5Gy RT was well tolerated by most patients, but grade IV diarrhoea was recorded in three elderly patients. One patient in the group (C) died from neutropenic fever. Many patients were reported to have less local symptoms after the treatment given. Delayed surgery was performed in all but nine patients. Radical surgery (R0+R1) was performed in 22 (92%) (group A), 4 (44%) (group B), and 6 (46%) (group C) patients, respectively. A pCR was seen in four patients (two in group A and two in group C). No postoperative deaths occurred., CONCLUSIONS: Considering the very high age and presence of co-morbidity, the 5x5Gy schedule is well tolerated. Further, considering the very advanced local stage, the schedule has considerable anti-tumour activity and can result in radical surgery in a high proportion of patients.",Excluded

Background: To investigate the capability of radiomic analysis using T2-weighted (T2W) and spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting the therapeutic response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): Pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI of 68 ESCC patients (37 responders, 31 nonresponders) were analyzed. A number of 138 radiomic features were extracted from each image sequence respectively. Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to evaluate the capability of each feature on treatment response classification. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the studied features were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were constructed based on the training set (23 responders, 20 nonresponders) for the prediction of treatment response, and then the testing set (14 responders, 11 nonresponders) validated the reliability of the models. Comparison between the performances of the models was performed by using McNemar's test. Result(s): Radiomic analysis showed significance in the prediction of treatment response. The analyses showed that complete responses (CRs) versus stable diseases (SDs), partial responses (PRs) versus SDs, and responders (CRs and PRs) versus nonresponders (SDs) could be differentiated by 26, 17, and 33 features (T2W: 11/11/15, SPAIR T2W: 15/6/18), respectively. The prediction models (ANN and SVM) based on features extracted from SPAIR T2W sequence (SVM: 0.929, ANN: 0.883) showed higher accuracy than those derived from T2W (SVM: 0.893, ANN: 0.861). No statistical difference was observed in the performance of the two classifiers (P=0.999). Conclusion(s): Radiomic analysis based on pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI can be served as imaging biomarkers to predict treatment response to CRT in ESCC patients.Copyright © Journal of Thoracic Disease.",Excluded

LEARNING OBJECTIVE #2: Discuss the management of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. CASE: In 2019, an 87-year-old Caucasian male with a history of chronic back pain presented to his primary care doctor's office with a chief complaint of low back pain. In 2004, an X-ray of the lumbosacral spine revealed mild lumbar spondylosis. His back pain began after bending over to pick up his wife. He denied recent trauma, fevers, chills, intravenous drug use, unexplained weight loss, history of malignancy, saddle anesthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence or progressive weakness. He was referred to pain medicine for consideration of steroid injection. MRI lumbar spine was ordered which showed a pathologic compression fracture of L4 with abnormal bone marrow involvement of the left iliac wing. MRI cervical, thoracic spine and CT chest, abdomen and pelvis were ordered to work up malignancy. CT was without metastatic disease. Repeat MRI showed diffuse heterogeneous bone marrow signal concerning for an infiltrating process. The patient was referred to oncology clinic. His father passed away from lymphoma. Physical exam revealed a well appearing male without adenopathy or midline spinal tenderness. Labs showed WBC 7.2, Hb 15.1, platelet count 250, monocytes elevated to 1.0. IgM was elevated to 1,694 while IgG and IgA levels were decreased. 24-hour urine protein collection was negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed CD5 negative/CD10 negative B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder involving approximately 35% of the marrow cellularity. The differential included marrow involvement by a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (favored by the presence of IgM monoclonal gammopathy) and marginal zone lymphoma. The MYD88 L265P mutation was negative. IMPACT/DISCUSSION: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. Elderly, white males are more commonly affected with an annual incidence of 3-4 persons per million. Symptoms are due to the infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow and IgM gammopathy of the blood. Milder symptoms can be secondary to anemia and organomegaly, while more severe symptoms can be due to CNS involvement and hyperviscosity syndrome. Diagnosis is made by monoclonal IgM gammopathy and a bone marrow biopsy demonstrating greater than 10% infiltration by small lymphocytes with a typical immunophenotype. The differential diagnosis includes IgM MGUS, CLL, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Asymptomatic patients are managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy. CONCLUSION(S): * Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia is a rare clinicopathologic entity demonstrating bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells and a serum IgM gammopathy. * Asymptomatic patients can be managed by observation alone while symptomatic patients are treated with chemotherapy.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) therapy on esophageal acid exposure of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and the correlation of anxiety and depression with recurrence of acid-related symptoms after discontinuation of PPIs., METHODS: From February 2010 to June 2011, 28 patients with GERD diagnosed by ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring admitted to Beijing Jishuitan Hospital were treated with esomeprazole 20 mg 2 times/d for 8 weeks (male 16, female 12). Symptoms after drug discontinuation were monitored. Ambulatory 24 h esophageal pH monitoring was performed on patients, whose symptom recurred within 8 weeks after treatment. BMI, Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were detected., RESULTS: Among the 28 patients with GERD, 15 (53.6%) recurred symptoms after withdraw of PPIs. Compared with the asymptomatic group after withdraw of PPIs, the pretreatment duration of pH 4 (supine), 24 h total acid reflux time, number of time periods with acid reflux > 5 minutes, the maximal acid reflux time and 24 h total number of acid reflux in the symptomatic recurrence group were statistically significantly increased (11.7% vs 4.5%, 138.8 minutes vs 62.1 minutes, 6.0 vs 2.0, 27.0 minutes vs 12.4 minutes, 74.0 times vs 43.0 times, respectively, all P values < 0.05). There were no significant differences in BMI, SAS and SDS between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: The basic level of esophageal acid exposure of patients with GERD before PPIs therapy may influence the esophageal acid exposure after PPIs therapy and then may affect the recurrence of symptoms. Although anxiety and depression is common in patients with GERD, it is not found that the recurrence of acid-related symptoms after the discontinuation of PPIs therapy is related to the anxiety and depression.",Excluded
1718,"Determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering. A method was developed for the direct determination of netilmicin in rat serum using high performance liquid chromatography and resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS). The separation was carried out on a Cl8 column with the isocratic elution of the mixture of 20 mmol/L sodium acetate aqueous solution and methanol containing 0.22% trifluoroacetic acid (92: 8, v/ v). With the molecular recognition probe of pontamine sky blue, netilmicin formed an ion-association complex and enhanced the intensity of RRS. The RRS signal was detected by a commercial fluorescence detector at 365 nm of both excitation wavelength (lambdaem) and emission wavelength (lambdaex). Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD, S/N = 3) for the netilmicin was 0. 7 mg/L. With the internal standard (IS) of tobramycin, a linear calibration curve ranged from 1. 2 mg/L to 30 mg/L was obtained. The presented method can be used for the pharmacokinetics study of netilmicin in rat serum, and can be a new choice for the determination of aminoglycoside antibiotics in biological samples.",Excluded

The aim of the current study was to improve the bone metastases irradiation parameters in patients with life expectancy more than 3 months. The current randomized study included a total of 333 patients with bone metastases (breast cancer metastases in 71% of cases) receiving 488 courses of photon irradiation. Irradiation effect was observed in 95.8-100% of cases regardless of fraction number and irradiation regimen. The rate of complete effect was the same for all irradiation regimens, but raised gradually from 33.3% to 50.4% and 65.9% respectively when irradiation was given by 2, 3 and 4 fractions, 6,5 Gy each (p < 0.03); 78.4% (p < 0.01) cases of complete effect were observed in patients receiving irradiation by multiple small fraction compared to the groups receiving irradiation by 2 or 3 fractions of 6.5 Gy. The complete effect was more often observed in breast cancer (67%) and prostate cancer (63%) patients in comparison to lung cancer (47%) and renal cancer (30%) patients (p < 0,05) independent of metastases localization. The mean frequency of pain recurrence in irradiated area was 8.2% in all primary tumor and metastases localizations, irrespective of irradiation dose and regimen. Based on above results we recommend for breast cancer and prostate cancer patients with bone metastases and life expectancy more than 3 months the irradiation with 19.5 Gy given by 3 fractions. The patients with metastasizing lung and renal cancer should receive 26 Gy irradiation by 4 fractions 6.5 Gy each given once every 5.",Excluded

OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded

AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the radiation usage in patients undergoing pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in Germany and to evaluate the possibility to reduce radiation dose., METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 6617 patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) from the German ablation registry and the FREEZEplus registry (control group), who underwent first PVI between 2007 and 2014, were analyzed. In the second step, the effect of optimized conventional fluoroscopy and optimized 3D mapping use was evaluated in 526 consecutive patients with AF who underwent first PVI at the Klinikum Ludwigshafen (optimized group) between 2007 and 2014. In the control group, the median dose area product (DAP) for PVI was 34 Gy cm(2), and the median DAP rate was 1.3 Gy cm(2)/min. The DAP decreased from 37 to 28 Gy cm(2), whereas the DAP rate increased from 1.3 to 1.6 Gy cm(2)/min between 2007 and 2014. In the optimized group, optimized radiation application and use of 3D mapping resulted in a continuous decrease in the DAP from 67 to 2 Gy cm(2) and DAP rate from 1.0 to 0.2 Gy cm(2)/min., CONCLUSION: Currently, the median radiation exposure during PVI in Germany is 28 Gy cm(2).

Background: Although positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) seems to be able to provide accurate information of lymph nodes status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we sometimes experience surgical cases with unexpected lymph nodes metastasis. The objective of this study is to demonstrate clinicopathological characteristics of patients with unexpected pathological (p) N1 and N2 NSCLC. Method(s): All patients with lung cancer underwent enhanced CT of the chest and PET/CT preoperatively for evaluating of lymph node status. Mediastinoscopy or EBUS-TBNA was not routinely performed. Unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases were defined as surgical cases which were proved to have hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis postoperatively in spite of negative 18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT. We retrospectively reviewed clinical features of these patients and analyze predictive factors for these unexpected diseases. Result(s): Between January 2007 and December 2012, 533 patients with lung cancer underwent (surgical resection at our institution. Among them, we reviewed 182 patients who had available preoperative PET/CT data and underwent a curative-intent operation with systematic or selective lymph node dissection. One hundred fiftyone patients (83%) had lung cancer with expected lymph node status, whereas, 31 patients (17%) were found to have lung cancer with unexpected lymph nodes metastasis, consisting of 12 (39%) unexpected pN1 and 19 (61%) unexpected pN2 diseases. There were 16 men and 15 women with a median age of 67 years. Seventeen patients were current- or past- smokers, and 14 were neversmokers. Tumor size ranged from 12 to 52 mm, and pathological T factor was pT1a in 3, pT1b in 5, pT2a in 19, pT2b in 3, and pT3 in 1. Histological type of the primary tumor were adenocarcinoma in 28 (90%), squamous cell carcinoma in 2, and large cell carcinoma in 1. Among 28 adenocarcinomas, the most common predominant subtype was papillary (20 patients; 71%), followed by acinar (5 patients), solid with mucin, micropapillary, and invasive mucinous (one patient, respectively). Of these patients, 7 patients had micropapillary component in varying proportions in their tumors. EGFR gene mutation status was available in 22 patients, and of these, 12 patients (55%) had tumors with EGFR gene mutation, consisting of exon 19 deletion in 5, exon 21 point mutation in 5, and other minor mutation in 1. In univariate analysis, tumor size (> 3cm), pleural, and lymphatic invasion were significant predictive factors for unexpected pN1 and pN2 diseases. Only in 151 adenocarcinomas, papillary predomiant tumor and having micropapillary component were significant predictive factors for unexpected lymph node metastasis. Conclusion(s): We should take care that false-negative rate is relatively high on preoperative PET/CT for lymph node status in NSCLC. Histological findings of the primary tumor are often important because they can provide predictive information for lymph nodes status even if there is no FDG uptake in regional lymph nodes on preoperative PET/CT.

707,"Surgeon-performed Ultrasound for the Staging of Acute Diverticulitis: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study. INTRODUCTION: Although contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CEACT) is still considered the gold standard for the assessment of suspected acute diverticulitis, in recent years the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been spreading more and more in this setting. The aim of this study is to compare CEACT to POCUS for the diagnosis and staging of suspected acute diverticulitis. METHOD(S): This is a prospective study conducted on 55 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of two Italian Hospitals with a clinical suspicion of acute diverticulitis between January 2014 and December 2017. All the patients included underwent POCUS first and CEACT immediately afterwards, with the diagnosis and the staging reported according to the Hinchey (H) classification modified by Wasvary et al. Three surgeons performed all the POCUS and the same two radiologists retrospectively analyzed all the CEACT images. The radiologists were informed of the clinical suspicion but unaware of the POCUS findings. The CEACT was used as the gold standard for the comparison. RESULT(S): The final cohort included 30 (55%) females and 25 (45%) males. The median age was 62 (24-88) and the median body mass index was 26 (19-42).Forty-six out of 55 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis on both POCUS and CEACT, whereas in seven patients the diagnosis was not confirmed by both methods. POCUS sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS accuracy was 96%.POCUS classified 33 H1a, 11 H1b, 1 H2 and 1 H3 acute diverticulitis. This staging was confirmed in all patients but three (93%) by CEACT. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care ultrasound appeared a reliable technique for the diagnosis and the staging of clinically suspected H1 and H2 acute diverticulitis. It could contribute in saving time and resources and in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to most patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

In the assessment of stent restenosis compared with CA on per-stent basis, there was no significant difference on sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of DSCT using HPS (100%, 97.1%, 83.3%, 100%), LPS (92.3%, 95.9%, 80%, 98.6%) and SEQ (93.3%, 97.3%, 87.5%, 98.6%) (P > 0.05). The effective dose of DSCT by HPS (1.0 +/- 0.5 mSv) is significant less than that by SEQ (3.0 +/- 1.4 mSv) or LPS (13.0 +/- 5.4 mSv) (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): DSCT using HPS provides good diagnostic accuracy on coronary stent patency compared with CA, similar to that by SEQ/LPS, whereas with lower effective dose in patients with HR lower than 65 bpm. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

2185,"[Therapy of radiation enteritis--current challenges]. Radiation enteritis is one of the most feared complications after abdominal and pelvic radiation therapy. The incidence varies from 0.5 to 5%. It is not rare that the slowly progressing condition will be fatal. During a period of 13 years 24 patients were operated due to the complication of radiation enteritis. Despite different types of surgery repeated operation was required in 25% of cases and finally 4 patients died. Analyzing these cases predisposing factors and different therapeutic options of this condition are discussed. Treatment options of radiation induced enteritis are limited; however, targeted therapy significantly improves the outcome. Cooperation between oncologist, gastroenterologist and surgeon is required to establish adequate therapeutic plan.",Excluded
3443,"Impact of gamma irradiation on the development and reproduction of Culex pipiens (Diptera; Culicidae). Purpose: The aim was to evaluate the effects of irradiation of Culex pipiens irradiated as pupae on the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration, adult emergence percentages and ovarian development in comparison with the un-irradiated group. Material(s) and Method(s): The mosquito, C. pipiens Linnaeus (L) was irradiated as pupae with three gamma doses 40, 60 and 80 Gy. Different biological aspects include the ovarian development of irradiated females tested. Result(s): Gamma doses used significantly increased the larval and pupal mortality percentages, the larval and pupal duration and significantly decreased the adult emergence percentages. Moreover, fecundity and egg hatchability percentages were severely decreased with increasing gamma doses. While the sterility% was positively correlated with the doses used. Gamma doses caused a dose-dependent decrease in the number of developed eggs, reduction in the number of developed oocytes, signs of degenerative processes in oocytes, yolk mass and egg size decrease. Conclusion(s): Results obtained indicated that gamma radiation of C. pipiens induced remarkable effects on the biological, developmental and reproductive activity.© 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Excluded
1435,"Survival outcomes and patterns of failure after D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer: A retrospective study. objective: The goal of the study was to analyze the incidence and patterns of failure in patients with gastric cancer who received D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): From January 2004 to October 2015, 324 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical D2 resection followed by postoperative CRT were enrolled. Clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of failure were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survival rates of these patients were 60.3 and 51.1%, respectively. 117 patients had recurrence or metastasis, with peritoneal recurrence as the most frequent (20.7%), followed by distant metastasis (14.2%). The most commonly involved distant organs were the liver (5.9%) and bone (4.9%). Locoregional failure occurred in 39 patients (12.0%), with isolated regional failure occurring in only 23 (7.1%). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed N stage to be an independent risk factor for distant failure-free survival (p = 0.012). Independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis were tumor differentiation (p = 0.022), T stage (p =0.035) and vascular invasion (p = 0.016). conclusion: Postoperative CRT has a potential effect on optimizing locoregional control, resulting in only 12.0% of locoregional failure. In patients after D2 resection and adjuvant CRT, peritoneal metastasis was the leading pattern of failure, followed by distant metastasis.Copyright © 2018 British Institute of Radiology.

3140,"Radiation therapy for extramammary paget disease: Treatment outcomes and prognostic factors. Purpose/Objective(s): Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a relatively rare cutaneous malignancy that primarily affects the genital regions, such as the vulva and scrotum, of the elderly. Although wide surgical excision is the standard curative treatment for EMPD, it is frequently unsuitable due to old age or severe coexisting disease. Radiation therapy is considered a possible treatment option for these patients, but to date there have been few studies that have presented treatment results. Consequently, we have investigated the outcome of radiation therapy in EMPD. Materials/Methods: Thirty-six patients with EMPD received radiation therapy with curative intent. Of these patients, 13 were men and 23 were women, and their median age at irradiation was 74 years (range, 52-94 years). The primary tumor sites were the perineum in 13 patients, vulva in 12, scrotum in 10, and penis in one. Twelve patients had regional lymph node metastases prior to radiation therapy, but none had distant metastasis. Total radiation doses of 45-80.2 Gy (median, 60 Gy) were delivered to tumor sites in 23-43 fractions (median, 33 fractions) with fraction sizes of 1.8-2.2 Gy (median, 1.8 Gy). Result(s): All irradiated tumors had disappeared macroscopically by 2-9 months after irradiation, and the initial complete response rate was 100%. However, 14 of the 36 patients developed recurrences, including four with local progression within the radiation field and 11 with lymph node or/and distant metastases outside the radiation field, during follow-up periods of 2-150 months (median, 40 months). All but one of the 11 patients with regional lymph node or distant metastases after irradiation exhibited tumor invasion into the dermis, whereas of the 15 patients without tumor invasion into the dermis, none had regional lymph node metastasis and only one had distant metastasis after irradiation. The local progression-free and diseasefree rates were 86% and 53%, respectively at 3 years and 86% and 45%, respectively at 5 years. Nine patients died at 6-73 months after irradiation; the causes of death were tumor progression in five patients, infectious pneumonia in two, renal failure in one and old age in one. The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 93% and 95%, respectively at 3 years and 61% and 80%, respectively at 5 years. Tumor invasion into the dermis was a statistically significant prognostic factor for both distant metastasis (p = 0.004) and survival (p = 0.005). No therapy-related toxicities of grade 3 or greater were observed. Conclusion(s): Radiation therapy was found to be safe and effective for patients with EMPD. It appeared to contribute to prolonged survival through good tumor control, and to be a promising curative treatment option.",Excluded
3692,"Incidence of radiation pneumonitis after hepatic intra-arterial radiotherapy with yttrium-90 microspheres assuming uniform lung distribution. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of clinical and imaging radiation pneumonitis (RP) in a cohort of patients treated with >30 Gy cumulative lung dose (CLD) using Y90 microspheres., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred three patients were treated with Y90 microspheres during a 4-year period. Of these, 58 patients received >30 Gy CLD. Patients were followed for toxicities suggestive of imaging or clinical RP. Toxicities were graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema. Patients were also followed for survival from time of first treatment., RESULTS: There were 44 men and 14 women. Forty-three patients had hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), whereas 15 had liver metastases. Mean and median follow-up were 7.3 and 6.0 months, respectively. Mean lung shunt fraction was slightly greater in the patients with HCC versus metastases (20% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.2308). The lifetime CLD for metastases and HCC groups were not statistically different (54.04 Gy vs. 48.44 Gy, P = 0.4303). Forty-three of 53 patients demonstrated no lung imaging findings suggestive of pneumonitis. Imaging findings in 10 patients included pleural effusions, atelectasis, and ground glass attenuation. There were no cases of clinical or imaging RP. Survival varied depending on stage as well as single and CLD. None of the patient deaths were attributed to respiratory compromise., CONCLUSION: RP was not predicted using the currently used Y90 dosimetry models that assume uniform distribution in the lungs. Further investigation and dose escalation studies are required to more precisely define the radiation tolerance of lung parenchyma using this mode of therapy.",Excluded
1285,"Efficacy of RADPAD R protection drape in reducing radiation exposure to the primary operator during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). BACKGROUND: The efficacy of RADPAD R (a sterile, lead-free drape) has been demonstrated to reduce the scatter radiation to the primary operator during fluoroscopic procedures. However, the use of the RADPAD R during TAVI procedures has not been studied. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now an established treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are deemed inoperable or at high risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Consequently the radiation exposure to the patient and the interventional team from this procedure has become a matter of interest and importance. Methods to reduce radiation exposure to the interventional team during this procedure should be actively investigated. In this single center prospective study, we determined the radiation dose during this procedure and the efficacy of RADPAD R in reducing the radiation dose to the primary operator., METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients due to undergo elective TAVI procedures were identified. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo the procedure with or without the use of a RADPAD R drape. There were 25 patients in each group and dosimetry was performed at the left eye level of the primary operator. The dosimeter was commenced at the start of the procedure, and the dose was recorded immediately after the end of the procedure. Fluoroscopy times and DAP were also recorded prospectively., RESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent transfemoral TAVI using a RADPAD R and 25 with no-RADPAD R. The mean primary operator radiation dose was significantly lower in the RADPAD group at 14.8 mSv vs. 24.3 mSv in the no-RADPAD group (P=0.008). There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy times or dose-area products between the two patient groups. The dose to the primary operator relative to fluoroscopy time (RADPAD: slope=0.325; no RADPAD: slope=1.148; analysis of covariance F=7.47, P=0.009) and dose area product (RADPAD: slope=0.0007; no RADPAD: slope=0.002; analysis of covariance F=7.38; P=0.009) was smaller in the RADPAD group compared to no-RADPAD group., CONCLUSIONS: Use of a RADPAD R significantly reduces radiation exposure to the primary operator during TAVI procedures.",Excluded
1283,"Host-parasite relations in cotton rat filariasis. III. The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii to un-irradiated and irradiated golden hamsters and white mice. The quantitative transmission of Litomosoides carinii by Liponyssus bacoti to un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters and mice is described. Both young and adult, un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters were highly susceptible to L. carinii but mice (un-irradiated or irradiated) were poor hosts. All hamsters (18 un-irradiated and seven irradiated) became infected. Seven out of nine mice in an un-irradiated series became infected. There was apparently 'age resistance' or 'young susceptibility' in the hamsters. The susceptibility of young hamsters appeared similar to that of new-born Carworth white rats and cotton rats. The pattern of infection in un-irradiated and irradiated hamsters was similar. Results from irradiated animals were insufficient to draw any clear conclusions on the effect of irradiation to susceptibility to infection with L. carinii. X-irradiation apparently did not affect the innate susceptibility cr resistance of hamsters and mice to worms. The duration and intensity of microfilaraemia was apparently higher in irradiated hamsters.",Excluded
1923,"Increased carotid wall thickening after radiotherapy on the neck. Patients treated for head and neck tumours with local radiotherapy (RT) on the neck harbour an increased risk of stroke. This may be due to accelerated atherosclerotic changes within the RT-field; however, the real impact of local RT on the carotid artery remains debatable. The aim of the present study was to assess the difference in carotid wall thickness (intima-media thickness) in 42 unilaterally irradiated parotid tumour patients by performing B-mode ultrasonography. A mean difference in intima-media thickness (IMT) of the irradiated compared with the non-irradiated carotid artery of 0.30 mm (P=0.031) was found. A significant correlation was established with a longer post-RT interval (P=0.008). RT on the neck is associated with increased thickening of carotid IMT. Screening and treatment of additional cerebrovascular risk factors which contribute to further IMT thickening and stroke development is recommended, especially in radiotherapy patients with a favourable prognosis.",Excluded

To determine the therapeutic efficacy and safety of risk-adapted stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) schedules for patients with early-stage central and ultra-central inoperable non-small cell lung cancer. From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

301,"Changes in posterior scleral collagen microstructure in canine eyes with an ADAMTS10 mutation. PURPOSE: We aimed to characterize alterations in the posterior scleral collagen microstructure before detectable disease onset in a canine model of open-angle glaucoma caused by an ADAMTS10 mutation., METHODS: Collagen orientation, anisotropy degree (proportion of preferentially aligned collagen), and relative density were measured at 0.4 mm spatial resolution using synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering. For statistical evaluation of structure parameters, regional averages of the peripapillary and mid-posterior sclera were compared between ADAMTS10 mutant (affected) dogs (n = 3) and age-matched (carrier) controls (n = 3)., RESULTS: No marked differences in the general pattern of preferential collagen fibril orientation were noted between the control and affected dogs. The peripapillary sclera of all specimens featured strongly aligned circumferential collagen ringing the optic nerve head. Collagen anisotropy was significantly reduced in the mid-posterior sclera of the affected dogs (carrier: 0.27+/-0.11; affected: 0.24+/-0.10; p = 0.032) but was not statistically significantly different in the peripapillary sclera (carrier: 0.46+/-0.15; affected: 0.45+/-0.17; p = 0.68). Collagen density was statistically significantly reduced in the affected dogs for the mid-posterior sclera (carrier: 28.1+/-9.14; affected: 18.3+/-5.12; p<0.0001) and the peripapillary sclera (carrier: 34.6+/-9.34; affected: 21.1+/-6.97; p = 0.0002)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant alterations in the posterior scleral collagen microstructure are present before the onset of clinical glaucoma in ADAMTS10 mutant dogs. A reduction in fibrous collagen density is likely an important contributory factor in the previously reported mechanical weakening of the sclera in this model. Baseline scleral abnormalities have the potential to interact with intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations in determining the course of glaucoma progression in animal models of the disease, and potentially in human glaucoma.",Excluded
2797,"Results of NCCTG N0275 (Alliance) - a phase II trial evaluating resection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. To examine, in a prospective fashion, the utilization and efficacy of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in patients with resected desmoplastic melanoma (DM). Adult patients with resected, margin-negative, and nonmetastatic DM were eligible for this single-arm prospective phase II study. Patients were to receive postoperative RT, 30 Gy in five fractions, to the operative bed with 2- to 3-cm margins (depending on the tumor location). Nodal basin RT was not allowed. The primary study endpoint was the 2-year local recurrence rate (LRR). Secondary endpoints included the incidence of regional and distant metastatic disease, progression-free survival, overall survival (OS), and treatment-related toxicity. Twenty patients with a single de novo DM lesion meeting trial eligibility criteria were enrolled and treated. The 2-year LRR was 10%, with two patients demonstrating a LR within 2 years of completion of protocol therapy. No regional or distant failures occurred. OS at 2 and 5 years was 95 and 77%, respectively. There were no grade 3 or higher acute or late adverse events that were related to the protocol therapy. Adjuvant RT after wide local excision (WLE) for DM is efficacious and well tolerated. It should be considered for DM patients after margin-negative WLE. Additional study is needed to further refine low-risk patient populations that can potentially have adjuvant RT omitted as part of the treatment plan.Copyright © 2016 The Authors.

447,"Effects of M-current modulators on the excitability of immature rat spinal sensory and motor neurones. M-currents have been shown to control neuronal excitability in a variety of central and peripheral neurones. Here we studied the effects of specific M-current modulators on the excitability of spinal neurones and their response to synaptic activation. Experiments were performed in vitro using the hemisected spinal cord from 7- to 11-day-old rats. Intracellular recordings were obtained from lumbar deep dorsal horn and motor neurones. Neuronal excitability was assessed by applying outward current pulses and synaptic responses were elicited by activation of a lumbar dorsal root. The M-current antagonist 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone (XE-991) and the agonist retigabine were superfused at 10 microM. Retigabine produced hyperpolarization and a large decrease in the excitability of motor (7/7) and dorsal horn neurones (11/12). The effects of retigabine were fully reversed by XE-991. XE-991 induced depolarization of most neurones tested and a large increase in the excitability of motor neurones (7/7) but only a weak increase in the excitability of a proportion of dorsal horn neurones (4/10). The effects of XE-991 were partly reversed by retigabine. Consistent with their effects on neuronal excitability, retigabine showed a general depressant effect on synaptic transmission, whereas XE-991 showed the opposite tendency to potentiate responses to dorsal root stimulation, particularly in motor neurones. The results show that retigabine can depress spinal excitability and the transmission of nociceptive information. Results also indicate a post-synaptic expression of functional M-currents in most motor neurones and a considerable proportion of deep dorsal horn neurones.",Excluded
2676,"Does hyperbaric oxygen administration before or after irradiation decrease side effects of irradiation on implant sites?. One of the main limitations of implant-based breast reconstruction is the high rate of complications such as capsular contracture and poor aesthetic outcome, due to adjuvant radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the side effects of irradiation. We aimed to investigate this effect of HBOT on the capsule reaction and skin, applied before and after irradiation, following the placement of an implant under the dorsal skin of the rat. Fifteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. A 18-mL smooth testicular implant was introduced into a subcutaneous pocket located on the dorsum of each rat. A single dose of 17-Gy irradiation was given to the implanted area of each rat at the third week. HBOT which lasted 3 weeks was administered to group I before irradiation, group II after irradiation. The control group did not receive HBOT. All of the rats were killed at the ninth week (6 weeks after irradiation). The dorsal skin with the capsule overlying the implant were excised for histopathological processing. The thickness of the capsule reaction of each group was evaluated statistically. Our histopathological examination revealed changes due to radiation in the control group. Many of these findings were found to be more subtle in group I and nearly absent in the group II. There was not any statistical difference between the thickness of the capsule reactions of the control group and group I, or group I and group II, but the capsular thickness of the control group was statistically higher than group II. It can be predicted that the use of HBOT following irradiation is an effective tool to reduce the capsule reaction of the implanted area and the tissue damage seen in radiodermatitis.",Excluded

We examined the association between citrus consumption and subsequent incident malignant melanoma among participants in the Nurses' Health Study (1984-2010) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2010). Among 105,437 participants over 2 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 1857 incident melanomas. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio for melanoma comparing the extreme total citrus consumption categories (1.5 or more serving per day vs. less than twice per week) was 1.30 (95 confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 1.57) (P=0.003 for trend). Grapefruit and orange juice were two individual citrus products that showed significant associations with risk of melanoma. The pooled multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios for melanoma were 1.41 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.82) comparing the extreme consumption categories of grapefruit (three times or more per week vs. never, P=0.004 for trend) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.56) comparing the extreme consumption categories of orange juice (once or more per day vs. never, P=0.001 for trend). Significant positive associations between citrus consumption and risk of melanoma were also observed for invasive melanoma and melanoma that occurred on the head, neck and extremities, and among participants who spent more time in direct sunlight since high school and resided in areas with higher solar ultraviolet radiation in the US.

2057,"Evaluation of chest x-ray utilization in nontraumatic chest pain in an academic emergency department. Background and Objectives: Overutilization of chest x-rays (CXRs) is costly, inefficient and results in increased radiation exposure. Several studies have proposed clinical decision rules (CDRs), which consist of clinical criteria or risk factors for an abnormal CXR, to minimize CXR utilization in non-traumatic chest pain patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). The purpose of this study is to evaluate CXR utilization among our ED patients suspected of acute coronary syndrome presenting with non-traumatic chest pain and to assess for clinical criteria/risk factors associated with an abnormal CXR in our population using criteria from previously published CDRs. Method(s): This is a retrospective review, using a single reviewer, of 500 charts of adult patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic chest pain from January 2016 to December 2017 at Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, PA. Each chart was screened for whether chest x-ray was performed, normal or abnormal x-ray radiologist interpretation, and presence of CDR criteria from 5 previously published studies. Among the abnormal results, we determined which findings were significant enough to lead to a change in clinical management. Result(s): A total of 487 of 500 (97%) non-traumatic chest pain patients received a CXR in the ED. Two hundred and twenty-one patients (45%) who met none of the 14 clinical criteria had a chest x-ray performed. Of those 221 patients, 11 patients (5%) had an abnormality on CXR, 3 (1%) of which led to a change in clinical management. All 3 patients were identified to have a possible pneumonia. The presence of at least 1 risk factor had a sensitivity of 94% for abnormal CXR findings and the absence of all of the 14 clinical criteria resulted in a negative predictive value of 99% for changes in clinical management. Conclusion(s): In this retrospective study, the use of the criteria from the various published CDRs would have reduced total CXRs by 45% among non-traumatic chest pain patients with minimal concern for missed findings. No single CDR perfectly fit our ED population but a selection of criteria from the different CDRs could be combined to create a CDR that fits our patient population. In the future, a prospective study could be performed to see if the combined criteria work as a CDR in our ED.",Excluded
796,"Sorafenib acts synergistically in combination with radiotherapy without causing intestinal damage in colorectal cancer. AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest cancers. Chemoradiotherapy gives better results than radiotherapy or chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. To enhance radiosensitivity of tumor cells for chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy drugs that act as radiosensitizers can be used. In the present study, we provide a scientific rationale for the clinical application of sorafenib as a radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer, without causing significant adverse effects on normal intestinal tissue., METHODS: Three human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480) were treated with sorafenib alone, or radiation followed by sorafenib. In vitro tests were performed using colony forming assays, cell cycle analysis, and comet assays. In addition, the effects of sorafenib and radiation therapy on the inhibition HT-29 tumor growth and survival of intestinal jejunum crypts were examined in vivo., RESULTS: Sorafenib increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480), as well as in HT-29 xenograft animal models. Sorafenib, in combination with ionizing radiation, induced the accumulation of tumor cells in the G2-M phase and delayed the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. The combination of sorafenib and ionizing radiation did not enhance the apoptosis of intestinal crypt cells, compared with the use of radiation alone., CONCLUSIONS: We provide a scientific rationale for the use of sorafenib in combination with radiotherapy in colorectal cancer.",Excluded
2087,"Abdominal circumference but not the degree of lumbar flexion affects the accuracy of lumbar interspace identification by Tuffier's line palpation method: An observational study. Background: Lumbar puncture for spinal or epidural anesthesia is commonly performed by palpating bony landmarks, but identification of the desired intervertebral level is often inaccurate. It is unclear whether such inaccuracy is related to patient factors, such as body mass index and degree of lumbar flexion. We hypothesized that overweight patients and patients with less of an ability to hyperflex their lumbar spines are prone to inaccurate lumbar spinous intervertebral level identification. Method(s): 52 adult volunteers were included in this study. 7 anesthesiologists with different years of experience identified and marked subjects' levels of the iliac crests, then marked the presumed interspaces. Lumbar X-ray was then performed with metal markers, and actual radiographic findings were identified and compared to the initial markings. Result(s): Patients with larger abdominal circumferences (mean (SD), 94.0(12.1) cm), higher body mass indices (25.9(3.9) kg/m), and aged between 50 and 70 years old had lumbar interspaces that were higher than the presumed level; patients with smaller abdominal circumferences (82.8(13.5) cm) and lower body mass indices (21.6(4.1) kg/m) had intervertebral levels that were lower than the presumed level. Cobb's angle, indicating the degree of lumbar flexion, did not affect the accuracy obtained. Conclusion(s): Patients' abdominal circumference, body mass index, and age are factors that may impact the accuracy of lumbar level identification. Tuffier's line, as identified by palpation, does not seem to be a reliable landmark for proper lumbar interspace identification in all cases.Copyright © Lin et al.",Excluded
3210,"The use of a comprehensive tumour xenograft dataset to validate gene signatures relevant for radiation response. PURPOSE: To investigate the use of xenograft models in a novel gene signature validation method using gene expression microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of ten human Head and Neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) were obtained. Several published prognostic gene expression signatures were evaluated within this set. These consisted of different radiotherapy relevant signatures (i.e. for hypoxia, proliferation and 'stemness'). Signatures were correlated with various endpoints that have been determined in the ten different xenograft models. These include immunohistochemical measures for hypoxia and proliferation, volume doubling time (VDT) and local tumour control after fractionated irradiation or after single dose irradiation under clamp hypoxia., RESULTS: We found several significant correlations between the published gene expression signatures and tumour parameters. Several signatures, like the proliferation and wound signature correlated with BrdU labelling index. Further a 'stemness'-related gene signature showed a strong negative correlation with hypoxic fraction., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of immunohistochemistry, in vivo tumour properties and gene expression profiling in a comprehensive set of xenograft models can be used to validate and potentially infer biological information about prognostic gene signatures.",Excluded

Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) has been an important component of treatment for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), but delayed neurotoxicity has been a matter of concern. We have employed partial-brain radiotherapy (PBRT) with wide margins for PCNSL patients with a single lesion or a few lesions. In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome in PCNSL patients undergoing PBRT. Between 2003 and 2014, 24 patients were treated with PBRT; 16 received high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) -containing chemotherapy before PBRT. Conventional fractionation with a median dose of 54 Gy was used. For reference, 15 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT were also analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 60% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 68% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy plus PBRT. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 41% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 36% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. The in-field recurrence rate was 26% and the out-of-field recurrence rate was 15% at 3 years for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT. The rates for in-field recurrence and the out-of-field recurrence were 27% and 21%, respectively, for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. CNS-recurrence rates were similar in patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and PBRT to the rates in those undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT. Neurocognitive dysfunction developed in 3 of the 16 patients undergoing MTX + PBRT and in 4 of 15 patients undergoing MTX + WBRT (P = 0.68). PBRT seems to be a feasible treatment option for solitary PCNSL. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the advantages of PBRT over WBRT. Copyright © The Author 2015.

89,"Low-dose simulation and sparse sampling with statistical iterative reconstruction: Dose reduction in MDCT-based bone mineral density and microstructure assessment. Introduction: The clinical use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to assess bone strength and fracture risk in subjects with osteoporosis is limited by the relatively high radiation doses of established protocols. In this study, the effects of simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling combined with statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR) on bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and microstructure analyses of trabecular bone were assessed. We also explored whether analyses based on low-dose protocols were still able to differentiate between subjects with and without vertebral fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): In routine chest and abdominal MDCT scans of 12 subjects with prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fractures and 12 controls, pairwise matched for age and sex, lower radiation doses were simulated by virtual lower tube current (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original current) and sparse sampling (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original raw data). All images were reconstructed with SIR. BMD and trabecular bone microstructure parameters (including bone fraction and trabecular thickness) were extracted from the reconstructed images in T10 to L5. Result(s): Effective dose of the original scan was 10 mSv, and 5, 3, and 1 mSv for the 50%, 25%, and 10% sparse sampled/low-dose simulated data, respectively. All BMD measurements calculated from different virtual lower tube currents and different sparse samplings were significantly lower in subjects with fractures compared with controls (range: 89-110 versus 125-187 mg/mL; p < 0.003 for all). Analogously, bone fraction (0.31-0.47 versus 0.50-0.52; p < 0.004 for all) and trabecular thickness were consistently lower in subjects with fractures (1.1-1.3 versus 1.7-2.4 mm; p < 0.011 for all). Conclusion(s): After simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling, BMD and microstructure parameters obtained from MDCT examinations and processed with statistical iterative reconstruction were still significantly different in subjects with and without vertebral fractures, suggesting an osteoporosis diagnosis to be feasible in low-dose protocols.",Excluded
1629,"Intra-arterial versus intravenous chemoradiation for advanced head and neck cancer: Results of a randomized phase 3 trial. BACKGROUND: Chemoradiation is the preferred treatment for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer. Higher doses of chemotherapy yielded promising results in vitro and vivo, confirmed by intra-arterial (IA) cisplatin-based chemoradiation in phase 2 studies. METHOD(S): Two hundred and thirty-nine patients with (functionally) unresectable head and neck cancer were included, from 2000 to 2004, in a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial, comparing IA and intravenous chemoradiation. Intravenous chemoradiation comprised 3x100 mg/m 2 cisplatin infusion on Days 1, 22, 43 combined with 70 Gy in 35 daily fractions. The IA chemoradiation treatment arm comprised 4x150 mg/m2 cisplatin administered in the tumor-feeding artery on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, immediately followed by systemic rescue with sodium thiosulfate with the same radiotherapeutic regimen. RESULT(S): Two patients were excluded from analysis because of nontreatment-related death immediately after randomization (n=1) and esophageal carcinoma (n=1). The median follow-up was 33 months 1-104 months. Ninety percent of the patients required tube feeding during treatment. Renal toxicity >grade 2 was 9% in the intravenous compared with 1% in the IA treatment arm (P <= .0001). There was no difference in locoregional control, disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS), between the treatment arms. At 3 years, local control, locoregional control, DFS, and OS was .76, .63, .44, .51 in the IA versus .70, .65, .47, .47 in the intravenous treatment arm, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Cisplatin-based IA chemoradiation was not superior to intravenous chemoradiation for advanced stage IV head and neck cancer regarding locoregional control and survival. © 2010 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

AIMS: To evaluate the outcome of intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of radiation-induced cystoid macular oedema among patients who underwent external beam radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma., METHODS: Five patients were recruited. The length of time from the last external beam radiation therapy to presentation ranged from 12 months to 15 years. Intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml) was given and repeated monthly injections were administered until best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved to 6/9 or until 3 further injections did not show further improvement in BCVA. BCVA was measured and fundus photography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography were performed at baseline. BCVA and OCT were recorded at each monthly visit. The duration of follow-up ranged from 6 months to 2 years., RESULTS: Five patients (7 eyes) were recruited. At the final visit, 3 eyes (71.4%) showed reduction in the central subfield thickness (CST; mean reduction of 17.6%, range 9-149 microm) with improvement in BCVA, whilst 2 eyes worsened in terms of CST and final BCVA. Another 2 eyes remained altered in BCVA despite slight improvement in CST., CONCLUSION: The use of intravitreal bevacizumab in this group of patients showed variable response in terms of CST and BCVA outcome but remains a viable option to treat this challenging condition.

1146,"A short radiotherapy course for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Effective palliation and patients' convenience. In order to facilitate patients with symptomatic locally advanced NSCLC, especially those coming from remote areas we have employed two palliative RT schedules. The first (S1) is the well known from Medical Research Council (MRC) randomized studies 2 x 8.5 Gy one week apart and the second (S2) is a two-day RT schedule: three fractions of 4.25 Gy are given on the first day and two fractions of 4.25 Gy on the second day. The records of 92 patients were reviewed (48 for S1 and 44 for S2). Patients, disease characteristics and results were similar for both groups; rates of symptom disappearance were for S1 and S2, respectively: cough 24 and 20%, hemoptysis 60 and 67%, chest pain 57 and 64% and dyspnoea 55 and 45% The overall condition improved in 39 and 36%, respectively. The median palliation time in days was in S1 and S2, respectively: cough 70 and 66, haemoptysis 133 and 139, chest pain 68 and 62 and dyspnoea 74 and 69 days. The median survival was 25 weeks in both S1 and S2 groups (P = 0.89 log-rank test). At 52 weeks (one year), ten (21%) and seven (16%) of the patients were alive in S1 and S2 groups, respectively. At 104 weeks, the corresponding figures were two (4%) and two (4.7%) for S1 and S2. Our results are in accordance to those reported in literature regarding the safety and efficacy of palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy schemes.

1443,"Gravity and Mastoid Effusion. BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic mastoid effusions have recently been observed in astronauts returning from long-term spaceflight. In hospitalized patients, mastoid effusion increases the risks for bacterial otitis and mastoiditis. We reasoned that cephalad fluid shifts during strict -6degree head down tilt bed rest could reproduce space-flight associated mastoid effusion and that artificial gravity may reverse the response., METHODS: The recent Artificial Gravity Bed Rest Study-European Space Agency study (AGBRESA) tested influences of artificial gravity during 60 days head down bed rest on a short-arm human centrifuge in healthy participants. The two intervention groups received daily artificial gravity with 30 minutes continuous artificial gravity or intermittent artificial gravity. A third group served as a control group and received no artificial gravity. We assessed cranial magnetic resonance images for mastoid effusions 1 day before bed rest, at days 14 and 52 of bed rest, and 3 days after bed rest., RESULTS: None of the participants exhibited mastoid effusions before bed rest. Six participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 14 (4 continuous, 2 intermittent, 0 control). Fifteen participants showed mastoid effusions at bed rest day 52 and 3 days after bed rest (7 continuous, 3 intermittent, 5 control)., CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid effusions commonly occur during strict head down tilt bed rest. The model can be applied to study the mechanisms and potential countermeasures for space flight-associated mastoid effusions. Formation of mastoid effusions during head down tilt bed rest is not prevented by daily 30 minutes short-arm intermittent or continuous centrifugation. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

OBJECTIVE To retrospectively evaluate the absorbed doses of organs at risk, such as lungs and the heart of the patients who underwent radiotherapy (RT) using the voluntary deep inspiration breath-hold (vDIBH) technique, and to compare the results with the literature. METHODS In this study, 102 patients who underwent adjuvant RT for the treatment of breast cancer in our clinic between November 2018 and December 2019 were included. A breast and/or chest wall, and/or lymph node RT of 50 Gy in 25 fractions was planned for all patients, and an additional boost of 10 Gy in five fractions was planned for patients requiring an RT boost. The treatment plans included 3DCRT, Field in Field (FIF), IMRT and VMAT approaches. RESULTS In the group undergoing supraclavicular fossa RT, the mean V20Gy was found to be 24.8%, compared to 16% in the group not undergoing supraclavicular fossa RT (p<0.01). In the group undergoing mammaria interna RT, the mean heart dose was 3.1 Gy, compared to 2.1 Gy in the group not undergoing mammaria interna RT (p=0.04).

Normal volunteers underwent a standard course of treatment to acquire a suntan in a commercial solarium, and tests of immune function were carried out before, on completion, and 2 weeks after completion of radiation exposure. Compared with age and sex matched concurrent controls, the test subjects had reduced skin test responses to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), slightly reduced blood lymphocyte numbers, and changes in the proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations. This included a relative increase in total (OKT3+) T-cell numbers which was attributable to an increase in the OKT8+ suppressor/cytotoxic subset of T cells. OKT4+ helper T cells were reduced and there was a significant decrease in the OKT4/OKT8 ratio. Other changes included a significant increase in suppressor T-cell activity against IgG production in vitro and depression of natural killer cell activity.

2523,"Falling back to earth: Altered splanchnic vasoreactivity may contribute to microgravity-induced orthostatic intolerance. The adaptations of the human cardiovascular system to microgravity, which are well tolerated while in space, can lead to dizziness, blurred vision, and fainting upon reentry. Specifically, orthostatic hypotension, a fall in blood pressure upon standing, poses a major problem for astronauts returning to Earth, and presents a hazard should an emergency ever arise during landing. Female astronauts are affected more frequently than males, suggesting underlying gender-related differences in cardiovascular regulation. One such difference has already been demonstrated: in response to an orthostatic challenge, males experience blood pooling primarily in the legs, while females show much more blood pooling in the abdominal region. Normally, the splanchnic blood vessels should reflexively constrict, initiating mobilization of the blood to supply the brain. In order to determine whether attenuation of this reflex is responsible for post-flight orthostatic intolerance (particularly in females), we examined in vitro vascular reactivity in male and female rats subjected to simulated microgravity (hind-limb unloading; HLU). The constrictor response of third-order mesenteric blood vessels to phenylephrine was measured by wire myograph. The sensitivity of female arteries to phenylephrine was attenuated following HLU. Maximal tensile response to phenylephrine was unchanged in these vessels, while maximal tensile response to high KCI increased. In male arteries, HLU did not significantly change any of these parameters. These results indicate that, after HLU, the mesenteric arteries of females (but not males) can be expected to show reduced sensitivity to noradrenergic sympathetic outflow. This may partially underlie the gender disparity in post-flight orthostatic hypotension.",Excluded
1500,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer. Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded
2762,"Establishing the European diagnostic reference levels for interventional cardiology. Interventional cardiac procedures may be associated with high patient doses and therefore require special attention to protect the patients from radiation injuries such as skin erythema, cardiovascular tissue reactions or radiation-induced cancer. In this study, patient exposure data is collected from 13 countries (37 clinics and nearly 50 interventional rooms) and for 10 different procedures. Dose data was collected from a total of 14,922 interventional cardiology procedures. Based on these data European diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for air kerma-area product are suggested for coronary angiography (CA, DRL = 35 Gy cm2), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 85 Gy cm2), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, 130 Gy cm2), electrophysiological procedures (12 Gy cm2) and pacemaker implantations. Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure. The generic DRL presented here facilitate comparison of patient exposure in interventional cardiology.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
2732,"Treatment of type I endoleaks using transcatheter embolization with onyx. Purpose: To report a single-center experience with transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using the liquid embolic agent Onyx, an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Method(s): Eight patients (4 men; mean age 74.8 years, range 63-86) with 10 type I endoleaks (6 abdominal and 4 thoracic) diagnosed 2 days to 9 years after endovascular repair were treated with Onyx embolization because cuff extension was precluded by an insufficient landing zone in 6 cases and an unsuitable aortic diameter in 2. Endoleaks were accessed with a 4-F diagnostic catheter and a coaxially introduced dimethylsulfoxide- compatible microcatheter. Onyx-34 was predominantly applied due to its high viscosity; patent side branches were coil embolized prior to Onyx delivery in 3 cases. Result(s): Technical success of the procedure was achieved in all cases. The mean volume of Onyx used for abdominal endoleaks was 11.8 mL (range 3.0-25.5) and 19.4 mL (range 4.5- 31.5) for thoracic endoleaks. The average duration of the procedure was 76.7 minutes (range 34.5-110.6), and the average radiation dose area product was 18.8 cGy*cm2 (range 10.6-55.8). Reperfusion of the endoleak was detected in one case 2 days after the procedure. A second case showed an occluded endoleak but a small trace of contrast between the aortic wall and the stent-graft. Non-target embolization was not found in any case. Mean follow-up was 13.2 months (range 8-24). The mean reduction in diameters for thoracic aneurysms after 6 and 12 months was 0.4 and 0.9 cm, respectively, and 0.6 and 1.2 cm, respectively, for abdominal aneurysms. Conclusion(s): Transcatheter embolization of type I endoleaks using Onyx is a simple, safe, and sustainable treatment option with a high primary success rate for cases in which stentgraft extension is not possible. The benefit of additional coil embolization remains uncertain. © 2014 by the INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ENDOVASCULAR SPECIALISTS.",Excluded

This work deals with the assessment of personal exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields and the study of temporal and spatial daily variations in a group of 24 adults from the West Bank, Palestine. Exposure was measured using a personal exposure meter EME SPY 140. Mean values of exposure levels from different radiofrequency sources were calculated using both naive and robust regression on order statistics approaches. The total daily exposure from all radiofrequency electromagnetic field sources varied widely among participants depending on their location, the mobile network they use, their activities, and their mode of transportation, ranging from about 0.2 V m to 0.9 V m. The average total daily exposure of all participants was about 0.48 V m. The main contribution to the mean exposure was from WiFi 2G (45%), GSM900 uplink (19%), GSM900 downlink, and FM radiobroadcasting (each by 11%). Other sources including GSM1800, UMTS2100, WiFi 5G, DECT, TETRA, WiMAX, and TV bands all together contributed 14%. During different activities, participants were exposed to the highest exposure level while traveling and to the lowest exposure while they were sleeping.

3106,"Failures (cause and time) of radiotherapy in oral cancer. The results of retrospective clinical evaluation concerning 434 cases of oral carcinomas treated with radiotherapy from January 1959 to December 1967 are presented. The analysis of the results obtained shows that radiotherapy alone may offer a reasonable possiblity of success in limited lesions (68.3% 5-year survival of Stage I patients). In more advanced local cases, and especially those with regional adenopathies, radiotherapy alone cannot consistently control the disease for a long period of time; 5-year survival from the onset of treatment was respectively 36.5% and 24.5% for Stage II and III cases. Moreover, if controlateral of bilateral metastatic adenopathies or fixed lymph nodes are present, the prognosis becomes dramatic (2.6% 5-year survival of Stage IV patients). Among the irradiation techniques currently available, curietherapy (intersitial applications or surface molds) presumably offers the best possibility of success, since the observed failures, both overall and stage by stage, are inferior. Radiotherapy alone may generally be of proven efficacy if the local or locoregional extension is limited. In more advanced cases a combined surgery-chemotherapy treatment method is recommended.

The lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years. Distant recurrence and carcinoma death rates significantly elevated in patients older than 60 years. The incidence of significant extrathyroid extension markedly increased with age, although that of large node metastasis or extranodal tumor extension did not differ much among the 7 subsets. With the Kaplan-Meier method, lymph node recurrence rate was poor in patients 20 years or younger and in those older than 60 years. Poor distant recurrence-free and cause specific survivals of patients older than 60 years were identified in the series of PTC patients with and without these aggressive features. It is therefore suggested that 1) Lymph node recurrence rate was high in patients 20 years or younger and those older than 60 years and 2) prognosis, including distant recurrence-free survival and cause-specific survival, of patients older than 60 years was poor regardless of clinicopathological features of PTC at initial surgery.",Excluded
729,"Argon plasma coagulation for the treatment of hemorrhagic radiation proctitis. BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Chronic radiation proctitis is a complication of radiotherapy for malignant pelvic diseases. Rectal bleeding caused by radiation proctitis is difficult to manage. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is an electrocoagulation technique that appears to be an effective and low-cost alternative to the use of lasers in gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of APC, as well as patients' tolerance of the procedure, in the treatment of bleeding radiation-induced proctitis., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The charts of 16 patients with chronic radiation proctitis were analyzed retrospectively. Their average age was 73.5 (range 62-80). Fifteen patients had prostate cancer, and one had uterine cancer. The average time to onset of symptoms after radiotherapy was 15 months (range 6-36 months). All patients had intermittent or daily rectal bleeding, and three patients needed blood transfusions. The severity of bleeding was graded from 0 to 4. APC treatment was administered every month; the argon gas flow was set at 0.6 l/min with an electrical power setting of 40 W., RESULTS: All patients were improved with APC treatment. A mean of 3.7 sessions was necessary to relieve symptoms. APC therapy resulted in a reduction in the mean severity score from 2.4 to 0.6. Seven patients had no recurrent rectal bleeding, and the bleeding was significantly reduced to occasional and negligible spotting (less than one bleeding episode per week) in nine patients. None of the patients required transfusions after treatment. During the follow-up period (average 10.7 months, range 8-28 months), one patient had a recurrence of rectal bleeding that required two repeat sessions. The tolerance was good, with no long-term treatment-related complications., CONCLUSIONS: APC is an effective, safe and well-tolerated treatment for rectal bleeding caused by chronic radiation proctitis. It should be considered as a first-line therapy for radiation proctitis.",Excluded
1328,"Dose reduction using digital fluoroscopy versus digital subtraction angiography in endovascular aneurysm repair: A prospective randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) can result in high radiation dose to patients and operators. This prospective randomized study aimed to assess whether patient radiation dose sustained during EVAR could be decreased by predominantly using digital fluoroscopy (DF) vs the standard technique using digital subtraction angiography (DSA)., METHODS: Between February 2011 and June 2017, patients with EVAR of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to a standard treatment DSA cohort or a DF cohort in which two or fewer DSA acquisitions were allowed for confirmatory imaging. Primary end points included dose-area product (DAP) and cumulative air kerma. Secondary end points included technical success and conversion to DSA standard treatment (if DF was inadequate for visualization)., RESULTS: For all 43 patients enrolled (26 in the DF cohort, 17 in the DSA cohort), technical success was 100%. Of the 26 DF patients, 5 (19%) required conversion to the DSA cohort. In an intention-to-treat analysis, mean DAP was significantly lower in the DF cohort than in the DSA cohort (132 vs 174 Gy.cm2; P = .04). When patients were separated by number of DSA acquisitions (two or fewer vs three or more), mean DAP decreased 41% (109 vs 185 Gy.cm2; P = .005) and cumulative air kerma decreased 40% (578 vs 964 mGy; P = .004)., CONCLUSIONS: In most patients (81%), DF or limited DSA was adequate for visualization during EVAR. In both intention-to-treat DF and limited-DSA cohorts, mean DAP was significantly decreased. If image quality allows, a DF-only or limited-DSA approach to EVAR decreases radiation dose.

3114,"Carcinogenesis studies with benzoyl peroxide (Panoxyl gel 5%). Several groups of hairless mice were given UV radiation with and without pretreatment with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA), 5% benzoyl peroxide in a gel (Panoxyl), and gel alone, in various combinations, with appropriate control groups included, in order to see whether benzoyl peroxide, which is known to enhance chemical skin carcinogenesis after a single, small dose of DMBA, also enhances UV carcinogenesis. The mice were observed for skin tumors, and all skin lesions were histologically investigated. The percentage of tumor-bearing animals with time is called the tumor rate, the total number of tumors occurring is called the tumor yield. Continual treatment with 5% benzoyl peroxide in gel twice a week, with or without a short pretreatment period of UV radiation resulted in only 2 skin carcinomas, which is remarkable, but not significant. Both Panoxyl and gel alone enhanced tumorigenicity significantly in animals pretreated with a single dose of 51.2 micrograms DMBA. There was no difference between the enhancement caused by Panoxyl and the gel as regards the tumor rate, but when measured as final tumor yield, Panoxyl was slightly more tumor-enhancing than gel alone. However, both Panoxyl and gel protected significantly against UV tumorigenesis (all tumors). There was no difference between the protective effect of the 2 types of treatment. Neither Panoxyl nor gel alone influenced significantly UV skin carcinogenesis (malignant tumors). It is concluded that under these experimental conditions both Panoxyl and gel alone tend to protect against the tumorigenicity and do not enhance the carcinogenicity of UV radiation in hairless mice, whereas both gel and Panoxyl enhance chemical carcinogenesis. The carcinogenic mechanisms may be different for UV and chemical carcinogenesis, respectively.",Excluded

Method(s): Experimental group A (n = 66) underwent CT with 43 % tube current reduction, and group B (n = 58) received an equivalent reduced dose by lowering the tube voltage. An age- and sex-matched control group (n = 72) receiving the conventional radiation dose was retrospectively collected. Imaging for the control group was reconstructed by FBP only, while images for groups A and B were reconstructed by FBP and IR. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs), sharpness, number of infarcts and severity of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) were compared to assess imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): There were no significant differences in SNRs and CNRs between group A and the control group. There were significantly decreased SNRs and increased CNRs in group B. Image sharpness decreased in both groups. Correlations between detected infarcts and severity of SAE across FBP and IR were high (r = 0.73-0.93). Head diameter was the only significant factor inversely correlated with infratentorial imaging quality. Conclusion(s): Head CT with 43 % reduced tube current reconstructed by IR provides diagnostic imaging quality for outpatient management. Key Points: * Cranial CT using iterative reconstruction provides diagnostic images with 43 % mAs reduction. * Blurring of infratentorial images becomes evident using low-radiation head CT. * Head diameter was inversely correlated with imaging quality in the infratentorium. * Lowering tube kilovoltage requires a higher radiation dose to maintain image quality. © 2013 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3455,"Imbalanced MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy and a distinctive MRI pattern. OBJECTIVE: Metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 and MMP-12 are proteolytic enzymes especially implicated in joint inflammation. This study aims to evaluate their association with arthritis features and hand MRI abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHOD(S): Fifty SLE patients, with a mean (SD) age of 48.1 (14.6) years were tested for MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels, then further classified according to the presence of X-Ray erosions and joint deformities. Eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 47.9 (11.8) and 14 healthy people aged 46.0 (11.0) were enrolled as control groups. A subgroup of 28 SLE patients underwent a dominant-hand MRI; the detected changes were classified and semiquantitatively scored as capsular swelling, synovitis, edematous or proliferative tenosynovitis, bone oedema, bone erosions. Statistical analysis was performed using multiple regression models. RESULT(S): MMP-3 were significantly higher in patients with Jaccoud's arthropathy (JA) (22.1ng/ml, p< 0.05) and independently associated with hsCRP serum levels (B-coeff 0.50; r=0.30; p< 0.05). MMP-12 serum levels were significantly lower in patients with JA (0.18ng/ml, p< 0.05) and inversely associated with the prednisone daily dose (B-coeff -0.03; r= -0.44; p< 0.01). Capsular swelling and edematous tenosynovitis, the most prevalent hand MRI changes in patients with JA, associated with higher MMP-3 (B-coeff 0.12; r=0.66; p< 0.01 and B-coeff 0.08; r=0.59; p< 0.01, respectively) and lower MMP-12 serum levels (B-coeff -7.4; r= -0.50; p< 0.05 and B-coeff -5.2; r= -0.44; p= 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Imbalanced MMP-3 and MMP-12 serum levels are influenced by inflammation and glucocorticoids in SLE patients and associated with JA and distinctive hand MRI changes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

616,"Untreated male osteoporosis: Case report. Objective: To underline problems connected with osteoporosis in men through case report. There are need to clarify the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and fractures in men and to develop diagnostic criteria as well as establish most effective treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): After low intensive trauma 64 years old man had back pain and pain in left forearm. X-ray show fractures of Th 12 and L2 vertebrae and left forearm. In his personal history there is also after low intensive trauma elbow and hip fracture in ages of 52 and 53. There are no other risk factor in personal and family history. DXA evaluation results: T-score total LS vertebrae -4.7 SD and T-score total -2.4 healthy hip. Laboratory tests: high rate of thyroid hormone and low rate of 25OH vitamin D. We started with treatment. Result(s): Osteoporosis is leading causes of morbidity and mortality in elderly. "" Silent disease"" progress without symptoms until a fractures occurred. Hip fracture is very serious complication. One fifth of it occurred in men but it rise about 10 years later than in woman. In 65-70 ages men loosing bone mass at the same rate as woman and the absorption of calcium decrease in both sex. For men before 65 years and high risk men recommendation is to begin periodic osteoporotic risk assessment and performing DXA. When we have diagnosis it is important to consider and exclude secondary causes of bone loss. It is almost certain lifestyle, diseases and medications. More than 40 % are primary or idiopathic osteoporosis in men. Careful history, physical examination and laboratory tests are enough component for making decision about treatment. Except medication men should be educated about adequate lifestyle measures as the prevention. Conclusion(s): Osteoporosis in men is an important and often overlooked problem. The consequences of it are underestimated and the condition is often unrecognised and untreated. There is no sufficient scientific based evidence for men osteoporosis. It is still an important public health problem.",Excluded
2831,"Radiation exposure in coronary procedures using the radial and femoral approaches. Background: Although the transradial approach had significantly reduced vascular complications, studies have demonstrated that it may be related to higher radiation exposure. The objective of this study is to compare radiation exposure in invasive cardiologic procedures using the transradial and transfemoral approaches. Method(s): Prospective cohort study including patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between August 2010 and December 2011. Clinical, angiographic and radiation exposure characteristics were recorded in a dedicated database. Patients were analyzed according to the access route: femoral or radial. Result(s): Of the 1,197 patients included in the study, 782 were submitted to procedures using the femoral access and 415 using the radial access. There was a lower prevalence of females (36.2% vs. 45.6%; P < 0.01), previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery (4% vs. 12.7%; P < 0.01) and severe valvular heart disease (0.3% vs. 1.4%; P = 0.07) in the radial group. The median radiation dose received by the patients was higher with the radial approach, both for diagnostic (621.6 mGy vs 445.7 mGy; P < 0.01) and therapeutic procedures (1,241.6 mGy vs 990.9 mGy; P < 0.01). Less experienced operators in the radial approach exposed patients to higher radiation doses (1,463 mGy vs 1,196 mGy; P = 0.02), which did not occur with the more experienced operators (1,311 mGy vs 1,449 mGy; P = 0.84). Conclusion(s): Patients undergoing invasive cardiologic procedures are exposed to higher radiation levels when the radial access is used.

448,"A regenerative role for bone marrow following experimental colitis: Contribution to neovasculogenesis and myofibroblasts. Background & Aims: Bone marrow (BM) cells form differentiated adult lineages within nonhematopoietic tissues, with a heightened propensity with increasing regenerative pressure dictated by disease. We have previously shown that BM cells engraft into the gut and contribute substantially to the subepithelial intestinal myofibroblast population in the lamina propria. To investigate the reparative capacity of BM in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a well-established model of experimental colitis was used. Method(s): Lethally irradiated female mice were rescued by a BM transplant from male donors. Colitis was induced 6 weeks posttransplantation by injection of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS), and tissues were analyzed 1-14 days later. Donor-derived cells were detected by in situ hybridization using a Y chromosome-specific probe, and their phenotype was determined by immunohistochemistry. Result(s): TNBS-induced colitis was manifest as patchy lesions that increased in severity between days 1 and 8, and the mucosa gradually regenerated between days 8 and 14. The contribution of BM to intestinal myofibroblasts was significantly increased in regions of colitis compared with noninflamed regions. Furthermore, BM-derived endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells were frequently interspersed throughout blood vessels, suggesting that these cells facilitate angiogenesis in tissue repair, substantiated by a significant increase in the incidence of BM-derived vascular smooth muscle cells in colitic compared with noninflamed regions. Blood vessels formed entirely from BM-derived cells were also seen, suggesting a role for BM in neovasculogenesis. Conclusion(s): Our data show that BM contributes to multiple intestinal cell lineages in colitis, with an important function in tissue regeneration and vasculogenesis after injury. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.",Excluded
981,"Detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma: Comparison of fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET) with contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) and serum CA 19.9. AIM: To establish the value of PET in the detection of suspected recurrent pancreatic adeno-carcinoma previously operated in comparison to contrast-enhanced multidetector CT and serum CA19.9. METHOD(S): Twenty-two patients (6 men, 16 women - mean age 77.6+/-2), previously operated for pancreatic adeno-carcinoma with suspected disease recurrence (increased CA19.9 > 40U/ml) were enrolled. Both PET and CT were performed in all cases. After visual analysis, maximum Standardized Uptake Values (SUVmax) of PET focal uptakes were calculated. PET data were compared to CT findings. The value of serum CA19.9 was also compared with the SUVmax obtained from each patient (in case of a patient with multiple lesions we considered the one with greater SUV max). RESULT(S): Out of 22 patients enrolled, 5 (22.7%) negative results at both PET and CT. In the 17 positive cases (77.3%) PET overall showed 26 areas of focal uptake divided as follow: 3 in pancreatic bed, 9 hepatic, 2 pulmonary, 9 nodal (7 sub diaphragmatic, 2 supra diaphragmatic) and 3 peritoneal. On the other hand CT overall showed 50 areas of contrast enhancement divided as follow: 1 in pancreatic bed, 6 in bone, 19 hepatic, 5 pulmonary, 17 nodal (12 sub diaphragmatic, 5 supra diaphragmatic), 1 peritoneal and 1 in adrenal gland. From the comparison between CA19.9 and SUVmax obtained for each patients, in 12 out of 17 positive PET cases we observed a statistically significant correlation (p<0, 05) between CA 19.9 trend and SUVmax. Five patients (22, 7%) with positive PET showed a not significant correlation between CA19.9 and SUVmax trend. The five cases with negative both PET and CT showed lower CA 19.9 levels than patients with positive PET. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with suspected pancreatic adeno-carcinoma relapse after surgery, PET reliably detected local and peritoneal recurrences, whereas CT seemed to be more sensitive for the detection of hepatic, bone, nodal and lung metastases. Although less reliable in the identification of lymph nodes, PET is able to clearly highlight mediastinal lymph nodes. Furthermore, PET does not appear to be advantageous for the detection of non locoregional and extra-abdominal recurrences. Our experience showed a significant direct correlation between CA 19.9 increase and SUVmax. Negative PET and CT cases with positive CA19.9 are probably due to the small size of recurrent disease. To confirm our data an improvement in casuistry is required.",Excluded
3130,"The development and biological characteristics of a novel potentially radioresistant inbred mouse strain. The growth of biomedical research over the previous decades has been accompanied by an increase in the number, complexity and diversity of experimental animals developed as research tools, and inbred mice are some of the most widely used. However, thus far, no inbred mice have exhibited strong radioresistance for use in radiation-damage research. To develop a radioresistant mouse model, a female Japanese outbreeding strain ICR/JCL mouse was mated with a male Chinese inbred strain 615 mouse. From the F1 generation, the mouse line was maintained by brother-to-sister mating. A novel mouse strain was established over >20 continuous generations and designated the Institute of Radiation Medicine-2 (IRM-2) mouse. The biological characteristics, genetic characteristics and susceptibility to radiation of these mice were determined. The IRM-2 mice inherited traits from the parents, including strong reproductive capacity, stable physiological and biochemical indices and few differences among individuals. According to the genetic results, the IRM-2 mice exhibited homozygosity, isogenicity and consistency, in agreement with international standards for inbred strains. Radiosensitivity studies have previously suggested that the lethal dose (LD)50 values for IRM-2 mice were 7.17 Gy (male) and 7.5 Gy (female), resulting in a dose reduction factor value of 1.39 (male) and 1.37 (female). The mortality of IRM-2 mice irradiated with 8 Gy total body irradiation was 15% at day 9 and 90% at day 15 after radiation. The number of nucleated cells in bone marrow, DNA content and colony-forming unit-spleen counts in IRM-2 mice after exposure to gamma-ray irradiation were markedly higher than the corresponding values for the parental strains, suggesting that the IRM-2 mice exhibit high resistance to ionizing radiation. Thus, it is suggested that this novel inbred mouse strain may be developed as an animal model of radioresistance for future use in radiation research.",Excluded

To compare FDG-PET/unenhanced MRI and FDG-PET/diagnostic CT in detecting infiltration in patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The endpoint was equivalence between PET/MRI and PET/CT in correctly defining the revised Ann Arbor staging system. Seventy consecutive patients with classical-HL were prospectively investigated for nodal and extra-nodal involvement during pretreatment staging with same-day PET/CT and PET/MRI. Findings indicative of malignancy with the imaging procedures were regarded as lymphoma infiltration; in case of discrepancy, positive-biopsy and/or response to treatment were evidenced as lymphoma. Sixty of the 70 (86%) patients were evaluable having completed the staging program. Disease staging based on either PET/MRI or PET/CT was correct for 54 of the 60 patients (90% vs. 90%), with difference between proportions of 0.0 (95% CI, -9 to 9%; P=0.034 for the equivalence test). As compared with reference standard, invasion of lymph nodes was identified with PET/MRI in 100% and with PET/CT in 100%, of the spleen with PET/MRI in 66% and PET/CT in 55%, of the lung with PET/MRI in 60% and PET/CT in 100%, of the liver with PET/MRI in 67% and PET/CT in 100%, and of the bone with PET/MRI in 100% and PET/CT in 50%. The only statistically significant difference between PET/MRI and PET/CT was observed in bony infiltration detection rates. For PET/CT, iodinate contrast medium infusions' average was 86 mL, and exposure to ionizing radiation was estimated to be 4-fold higher than PET/MRI.

2130,"The benefits and pitfalls of ipsilateral radiotherapy in carcinoma of the tonsillar region. PURPOSE: Ipsilateral techniques designed to restrict treatment to the primary tumor and neck on the same side have been used in selected cases of cases of carcinoma of the tonsillar region at our institution for many years. The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the risk of failure in the opposite neck in cases selected for unilateral radiotherapy over a 21-year period., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ipsilateral radiotherapy techniques were used in 228 of 642 patients with carcinoma of the tonsillar region from 1970 to 1991. Local control, regional lymph-node control (including contralateral failure), and survival were calculated for different degrees of tumor extent treated with these techniques., RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 7 years. Cases tended to be T1 and T2, with N0 disease. The 3-year actuarial local control rate was 77% and cause-specific survival was 76%. Opposite neck failure was seen in 8 patients (crude rate of 3.5%). In the earlier period of the study, primary coverage was problematic in a proportion of cases and resulted in higher rates of local failure., CONCLUSION: Appropriately selected cases of carcinoma of the tonsil show minimal risk of failure in the opposite neck with ipsilateral techniques.

1670,"Treatment results of alternating chemoradiotherapy followed by proton beam therapy boost combined with intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for stage III-IVB tongue cancer. Purpose: Proton beam therapy (PBT), compared with conventional radiotherapy, can deliver high-dose radiation to a tumor, while minimizing doses delivered to surrounding normal tissues. The better dose distribution of PBT may contribute to the improvement in local control rate and reduction in late adverse events. We evaluated therapeutic results and toxicities of PBT combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) in patients with stage III-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. Material(s) and Method(s): After 2 systemic chemotherapy courses and whole-neck irradiation (36 Gy in 20 fractions), we administered concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising PBT for the primary tumor [28.6-33 Gy(RBE) in 13-15 fractions] and for the metastatic neck lymph node [33-39.6 Gy(RBE) in 15-18 fractions] with weekly retrograde intra-arterial chemotherapy by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulfate. Result(s): Between February 2009 and September 2012, 33 patients were enrolled. The median follow-up duration was 43 months. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local control rate, and regional control rate for the neck were 87.0, 74.1, 86.6, and 83.9 %, respectively. Major acute toxicities >grade 3 included mucositis in 26 cases (79 %), neutropenia in 17 cases (51 %), and dermatitis in 11 cases (33 %). Late grade 2 osteoradionecrosis was observed in 1 case (3 %). Conclusion(s): PBT-IACT for stage III-IVB tongue cancer has an acceptable toxicity profile and showed good treatment results. This protocol should be considered as a treatment option for locally advanced tongue cancer.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
330,"Phase 1 trial of allogeneic gene-modified tumor cell vaccine RCC-26/CD80/IL-2 in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical studies showed that the allogeneic tumor cell line RCC-26 displayed natural immunogenic potential that was enhanced through expression of CD80 costimulatory molecules and secretion of interleukin-2. Here we report the study of RCC-26/CD80/IL-2 cells in a phase 1 vaccine trial of renal cell carcinoma patients with metastatic disease (mRCC). Fifteen patients of the HLA-A*0201 allotype, with at least one metastatic lesion, were included. Irradiated vaccine cells were applied in increasing doses of 2.5, 10, and 40x106 cells over 22 weeks. Primary study parameters included safety and toxicity. Sequential blood samples were analyzed by interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunospot assays to detect tumor antigen-associated (TAA) effector cells. The vaccine was well tolerated and the designated vaccination course was completed in 9 of 15 patients. Neither vaccine-induced autoimmunity nor systemic side effects were observed. Delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions were detected in 11 of 12 evaluated patients and were particularly strong in patients with prolonged survival. In parallel, vaccine-induced immune responses against vaccine or overexpressed TAA were detected in 9 of 12 evaluated patients. No tumor regressions occurred according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) criteria; however, median time to progression was 5.3 months and median survival was 15.6 months, indicating substantial disease stabilization. We conclude that vaccine use was safe and feasible in mRCC. Clinical benefits were limited in these patients with advanced disease; however, immune monitoring revealed vaccine-induced responses against multiple TAAs in the majority of study participants. These results suggest that this vaccine could be useful in combination therapies and/or minimal residual disease. © Copyright 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

Sixty-two ultra high molecular weight polyethylene prosthetic components (PEs) (31 tibial plateaux and 31 cups), sterilised by gamma rays or ethylene oxide (EtO), were retrieved after 1-12 years depending on different medical reasons and were studied by FTIR spectroscopy with derivatisation of oxidised species. Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process. Ester and acid formation might arise from the diffusion of components of synovial liquid or from the oxidation process, whereas hydroperoxide formation is thought to be due to the oxidation. Abrasion and delamination process is discussed considering the topological distribution of degradation products.",Excluded

2351,"Radiographic Union Scoring Scale for Determining Consolidation Rates in the Calcaneus. The reliable evaluation of osseous consolidation after hindfoot osteotomy can be difficult. Concomitant hindfoot osteotomies often dictate the advancement of weightbearing, and radiographs are the mainstay imaging tool owing to cost, efficiency, and radiation exposure. Understanding the radiographic parameters that can be used to reliably determine osseous healing is paramount. However, currently, no reliable or validated method is available to determine osseous healing of hindfoot osteotomies in irregular bones of the foot. The purpose of the present study was to develop a radiographic healing scoring system that would enhance the diagnostic healing assessment after elective calcaneal osteotomy. We adapted existing orthopedic scales validated for healing in the leg for application in the irregular bones of the foot. A total of 168 cases were evaluated by 6 blinded assessors to test the interrater reliability of subjective healing assessment compared with the proposed scoring system. The radiographs were classified by postoperative period: <=4 weeks, 5 to 12 weeks, and >12 weeks. The proposed scale had high interrater reliability but was burdensome. Using a priori item reduction protocols, a limited 6-item scale further improved internal consistency and reduced the burden. The result was excellent interrater reliability (alpha = 0.98, standard deviation 0.02, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 0.96) among all assessors when using the scoring scale compared with unacceptable reliability (alpha = 0.438) for subjective osteotomy healing. The reliability of our system appeared superior to that of subjective assessment of osseous healing alone, even in the absence of clinical correlates after osteotomy of the calcaneus.

2580,"Reduced-dose CT: Effect on reader evaluation in detection of pulmonary embolism. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduction in radiation dose on CT detection of pulmonary embolism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Emergency department patients were evaluated for pulmonary embolism with standard and simulated reduced-dose CT angiography. Simulated lower-dose CT angiograms obtained at 90, 45, 22, and 10 mAseff were reconstructed by mathematical addition of noise to the standard dose (180 mAseff) data from the images of 18 patients with and 20 patients without pulmonary embolism. Four radiologists blinded to the study parameters separately interpreted each CT angiogram. Dose trends for subjective measures (diagnostic certainty, image quality, and perceived technical limitations) were evaluated, test characteristics for the detection of pulmonary embolism were computed, and clot burden was measured. RESULTS. Readers indicated significant reductions in diagnostic certainty (p < 0.02) and image quality (p < 0.02) and an increase in perceived technical limitations (p < 0.01) as the simulated radiation dose was decreased. These subjective measures also showed significant adverse dose trends when the mAseff was reduced (p < 0.001). At reduced radiation doses, the sensitivity and positive predictive value for detection of pulmonary embolism diminished significantly. The sensitivity was 0.94 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); specificity, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.98); positive predictive value, 0.95 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); and negative predictive value, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.97). All patients had a low to moderate clot burden. CONCLUSION. Reduction in dose for CT angiography in the detection of pulmonary embolism has a significant adverse effect on readers' subjective assessment of diagnostic confidence and image quality. Detection of pulmonary embolism also decreases as the tube current dose is reduced. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1654,"Weekly 70 Gy thoracic radiotheraphy concurrent with docetaxel or paclitaxel after induction chemotherapy of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Prospective study of tolerance and efficacy. Introduction: Chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) constitute the standard care of patients with inoperable/unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. However, the optimal schedule of treatment remains to be determined. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted in patients with locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, to determine the tolerability and local control obtained with 7 weekly courses of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy using Docetaxel (D: 20 mg/m2) or Paclitaxel (P: 60 mg/m2) and TRT (2 Gy daily Monday through Friday, totalizing 70 Gy in the seven weeks), after 3 cycles of cisplatinum-based induction chemotherapy (cisplatinum + gemcitabine +/- vinorelbine). Result(s): From December 1999 to December 2004, fifty two out of 129 patients treated with induction chemotherapy and at least with stable disease were considered eligible for analysis. Twenty seven were treated with docetaxel (D) and twenty five with paclitaxel (P). The average of weeks of treatment was 5 for D (range 7-3) and 6 for P (7-1), and 40% and 58% of patients respectively in each group completed 7 weeks and received the programmed doses. Significant toxicity during concurrent therapy included (D/P %): esophagitis (grade I, 22/18; grade II, 25/29; grade III, 30/8), pneumonitis (grades I-II, 14/5), diarrhea (grades I-II, 14/0). The percentage of local progression and median time elapsed were 41% and 180 days in the D group of patients, and 46% and 240 days in the P group. Conclusion(s): No definitive conclusions can be made, considering the small size of the sample in this study, but the observed trends suggest that concurrent chemo-radiotherapy employing TRT and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel administered weekly offer similar local efficacy, Paclitaxel showing a lower toxicity.",Excluded
2987,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of brain metastases. BACKGROUND: This retrospective review evaluated the efficacy and toxicity profiles of various dose fractionations using hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) in the treatment of brain metastases. METHOD(S): Between 2004 and 2007, 36 patients with 66 brain metastases were treated with HSRT. Nine of these subjects were excluded because of the absence of post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging scans, resulting in 27 patients with a total of 52 lesions. Of these 52 lesions, 45 lesions were treated with whole-brain radiotherapy plus a HSRT boost and 7 lesions were treated with HSRT as the primary treatment. The median prescribed dose was 25 grays (Gy) (range, 20 Gy-36 Gy) with a median of 5 fractions (range, 4 fractions-6 fractions) to a median 85% isodose line (range, 50%-100%). The median follow-up interval was 6.6 months (range, 0.9 months-26.8 months). RESULT(S): The median overall survival time was 10.8 months, and 66.7% of patients died of disease progression. After HSRT treatment of 52 brain lesions, 13 lesions demonstrated complete responses, 12 lesions demonstrated partial responses, 22 lesions demonstrated stable disease, and 5 lesions demonstrated progressive disease. Actuarial local tumor control rates at 6 months and 1 year were 93.9% and 68.2%, respectively. Maximum tumor dimension, concurrent chemotherapy, and a tumor volume <1 cc were found to be statistically significant factors for local tumor control. One patient had a grade 3 toxicity (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). CONCLUSION(S): HSRT provides a high level of tumor control with minimal toxicity comparable to single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The results of the current study warrant a prospective randomized study comparing single-fraction SRS with HSRT in this patient population. © 2009 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Purpose: The goal of this study was to design a positioning device that would allow for selective irradiation of the mouse brain with a clinical linear accelerator. Method(s): We designed and fabricated an immobilization fixture that incorporates three functions: head stabilizer (through ear bars and tooth bar), gaseous anesthesia delivery and scavenging, and tissue mimic/bolus. Cohorts of five mice were irradiated such that each mouse in the cohort received a unique dose between 1000 and 3000 cGy. DNA damage immunohistochemistry was used to validate an increase in biological effect as a function of radiation dose. Mice were then followed with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Result(s): There was evidence of DNA damage throughout the brain proportional to radiation dose. Radiation-induced damage at the prescribed doses, as depicted by H&E, appeared to be constrained to the white matter consistent with radiological observation in human patients. The severity of the damage correlated with the radiation dose as expected. Conclusion(s): We have designed and manufactured a device that allows us to selectively irradiate the mouse brain with a clinical linear accelerator. However, some off-target effects are possible with large prescription doses.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded

Irradiation was associated with small falls in plasma potassium and calcium concentrations in both groups. In the 'elemental' group there was a small increase in circulating alanine and insulin concentrations and a fall in glycerol and ketone body concentrations, but all variables remained within or close to normal basal reference ranges. Plasma albumin fell slightly but significantly in the 'elemental' diet group from 44 +/- 1 to 42 +/- 1 g/litre during treatment. Is is concluded that modern radiotherapy is no more than a modest catabolic stimulus. Long-term dietary supplementation with 'elemental' diets in ill subjects did not produce adverse effects.",Excluded
855,"Different pedicle osteosynthesis for thoracolumbar vertebral fractures in elderly patients. Introduction: Pedicle screws' stability, especially in osteoporotic fractures, is a really problem for spinal surgeons. Nowadays, little is known about the influence of different screw types and amount of cement applied. This single-center retrospective observational study has the aim of evaluating the middle- to long-term mechanical performances of different types of screws in elderly patients with thoracolumbar fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 91 patients (37 males and 54 females), treated between 2011 and 2016, affected by somatic osteoporotic fractures aged over 65 years were treated. We divided patients into three different populations: solid screws, cannulated screws and cannulated screws augmented with poly methyl methacrylate cement (PMMA). Patients were radiologically evaluated with X-rays in pre- and post-surgery and at the follow-up (FU). Clinical evaluations were made with VAS and Oswestry Disability Index. Result(s): A total of 636 screws were implanted (222 pedicle screws, 190 cannulated and 224 cannulated screws with PMMA augmentation). At FU, we found significative differences between populations in terms of mechanical performances. We founded five cases of loosening; these were reported in solid screws group and in cannulated screws one. No mechanical failures were reported in cannulated screws with augmentation of PMMA. No rods breakage cases were reported. Conclusion(s): All stabilization methods showed good clinical results, but cannulated screws augmented with PMMA seem to provide better implant stability with the lowest rate of loosening.

1574,"Reduction of radiation exposure in cryoballoon ablation procedures: a single-centre study applying intracardiac echocardiography and other radioprotective measures. Aims: The population treated with cryoballoon (CB) ablation is relatively young, and radiation protection is of major importance. We aimed to demonstrate that radiation exposure can be markedly reduced by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and optimized settings of the X-ray system., Methods and results: We analysed 100 patients undergoing CB pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In 50 consecutive patients (25 male, 59 +/- 13 years; Group 1), we used ICE, skipped PV angiography prior to CB inflation, and avoided fluoroscopy whenever possible. Furthermore, we reduced the frame rate, minimized distance between patient and detector, and consequently applied collimation. These patients were compared with 50 similar preceding patients in Group 2 (29 male, 61 +/- 12 years). Total fluoroscopy time was reduced from 18 +/- 6 min in Group 2 to 12 +/- 5 min in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the dose area product was significantly lower (1555 +/- 1219 vs. 4935 +/- 2094 cGycm2, P < 0.001), total freezing time was significantly shortened (1855 +/- 399 vs. 2121 +/- 756 s, P = 0.031), and contrast media use was significantly reduced (66 +/- 25 vs. 109 +/- 27 mL, P < 0.001). At the same time, total procedure duration and complication rates did not differ significantly between both groups. After a 12 months follow-up, a similar percentage of patients was free from recurrences (74% in Group 1 vs. 78% in Group 2, P = 0.640)., Conclusion: Radiation exposure in CB PVI can be markedly reduced without prolonging procedure times, affecting the outcome or complication rates. Moreover, ICE seems to shorten total freezing time. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2016.

339,"Cytoplasmic chromatin triggers inflammation in senescence and cancer. Chromatin is traditionally viewed as a nuclear entity that regulates gene expression and silencing. However, we recently discovered the presence of cytoplasmic chromatin fragments that pinch off from intact nuclei of primary cells during senescence, a form of terminal cell-cycle arrest associated with pro-inflammatory responses. The functional significance of chromatin in the cytoplasm is unclear. Here we show that cytoplasmic chromatin activates the innate immunity cytosolic DNA-sensing cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase linked to stimulator of interferon genes) pathway, leading both to short-term inflammation to restrain activated oncogenes and to chronic inflammation that associates with tissue destruction and cancer. The cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway promotes the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in primary human cells and in mice. Mice deficient in STING show impaired immuno-surveillance of oncogenic RAS and reduced tissue inflammation upon ionizing radiation. Furthermore, this pathway is activated in cancer cells, and correlates with pro-inflammatory gene expression in human cancers. Overall, our findings indicate that genomic DNA serves as a reservoir to initiate a pro-inflammatory pathway in the cytoplasm in senescence and cancer. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-mediated pathway may hold promise in treating inflammation-related disorders.Copyright © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

2894,"Dosimetric study of intensity modulated arc therapy for total marrow irradiation. Purpose/Objective(s): In recent years, helical tomotherapy has been used for total bone marrow irradiation for sparing of critical organs. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of intensity-modulated arc therapy (IMAT) for total bone marrow irradiation. Materials/Methods: Three patients who received total marrow irradiation with helical tomotherapy, two females and one male, were selected for this dosimetric study. Each patient had one CT scan with normal breathing from the skull to the mid-thigh, and two CT scans at the end of the expiration and inspiration phases. Contours for target volumes and normal organs were drawn to take into account breathing effects. The target volumes included the bone volume from the skull to the mid-thigh, lymph nodes, and spleen. 12 Gy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target volumes. Varian RapidArc IMAT plans were generated with the same target volumes as the helical tomotherapy plans. For each patient, 23 normal structures were included in plan optimization, including all the major organs in the body. In helical tomotherapy plans, 5 cm jaw width was used. For IMAT planning, eight arc fields were used for each patient to cover the entire target volumes, with the isocenters aligned along the superior-inferior axis. Both the helical tomotherapy and IMAT plans were normalized to cover 85% of the bone volume by 12 Gy. Result(s): The average values of themean doses to the normal organswere 6.0 Gy, 6.0 Gy, and 5.8Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients; they were 4.8 Gy, 5.4 Gy, and 5.2 Gy, respectively, in IMAT plans. Of the 63 organs that could be compared pairwise, 43 had lower means using IMATand 17 had lowermeans using tomotherapy.Of the 40 organ pairs whose mean doses differed bymore than 10%, 33 had lower means in IMAT plans.D10 (theminimumdose level covering 10%of the volume) for the bone volume were 13.5 Gy, 13.1 Gy, and 13.5 Gy in helical tomotherapy plans for the three patients, respectively; they were 13.7 Gy, 14.4Gy, and 14.3Gy in IMAT plans. Comparable dose coveragewas achieved by IMAT plans for other target volumes. The average beam-on timewas 19.4minutes for helical tomotherapy and approximately 16 minutes for IMAT. Planning time excluding contouring was approximately 4h for each method. The average monitor unit (MU) in helical tomotherapy plans was 17,207 MU; it was 4,916 MU in IMAT plans. Conclusion(s): Compared to helical tomotherapy plans, IMAT plans showed consistent improvement in sparing of normal organs while delivering a somewhat less homogeneous dose to the target volumes for total bone marrow irradiation. This study indicates that IMAT can be used effectively for total bone marrow irradiation. With either treatment lower extremities are most efficiently treated with conventional open fields.",Excluded

2940,"The relative frequency in which empiric dosages of radioiodine would potentially overtreat or undertreat patients who have metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer. The dosage of (131)I for the treatment of metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer is typically selected empirically. Benua and Leeper implemented a method to estimate the maximum dosages of (131)I that could be administered to a patient so as not to exceed a maximum tolerated radiation absorbed dose (MTD), which was defined as 200 rads (cGy) to the blood. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of (131)I treatments in which the patient (1) would have exceeded the MTD (i.e., overtreatment) or (2) would have been able to receive higher dosages of (131)I thereby delivering a potentially higher radiation absorbed dose to their metastases (i.e., undertreatment) had the patient been administered various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. The dosimetrically-determined maximum tolerated radioactivities (MTA) to deliver 200 rads to the blood (MTD) were tabulated at our facility. Data were then grouped to determine the percentage of patients who would have received less than or more than the MTD for various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. A total of 127 dosimetries were performed. For assumed empiric dosages of (131)I (100 mCi, 150 mCi, 200 mCi, 250 mCi, and 300 mCi), the percentage of treatments for which patients would have exceeded the MTD were less than 1%, 5%, 11%, 17%, and 22%, respectively, and could have received a higher dosage of (131)I were more than 99%, 95%, 89%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. A significant number of patients receiving various empiric dosages of (131)I may exceed 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential overtreating). Likewise, the majority of patients may be able to receive much higher dosages of (131)I relative to empiric dosages thereby delivering potentially higher radiation absorbed doses to the metastases without exceeding 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential undertreating).",Excluded
1260,"Clinical feasibility and effectiveness of bedside peripherally inserted central catheter using portable digital radiography for patients in an intensive care unit: A single-center experience. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of bedside peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) using portable digital radiography (DR) in intensive care unit (ICU) patients.Sixty-five ICU patients who underwent PICC were enrolled in this study between May 2016 and May 2017. Of these 65 patients, 45 (69.2%) underwent the procedures bedside in ICU using portable DR, and 20 (30.8%) underwent the procedures at the intervention clinic, both performed by a single interventional radiologist. We retrospectively reviewed electronic medical records for clinical presentation, total procedural time, total radiation dose, total patient transfer time, and clinical outcomes. We performed an independent t test to compare the clinical effectiveness between the 2 groups. The technical and clinical success rates were 100% in both groups, and there were no procedure-related complications. The total radiation dose of bedside PICC at ICU was significantly lower than that of conventional PICC at the intervention clinic (557.9 mGy*cm +/- 209.2 vs 985.2 mGy*cm +/- 547.6, P < .001). The total procedure time was significantly different between the bedside and conventional PICC groups (26.8 minutes +/- 3.9 vs 24.1 minutes +/- 5.55, P = .028).

2354,"Pattern of care and outcome in elderly patients with glioblastoma: Data in 151 patients from 3 Lombardia Hospitals. The appropriate treatment approach for elderly patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is unclear, although different studies suggest survival benefit in fit patients treated with radiotherapy and chemiotherapy after surgery. We performed a retrospective analysis of 151 patients older than 65 years with GBM treated in 3 Lombardia Hospitals. In univariate regression analysis higher KPS (p = 0.02), macroscopical total resection (p < 0.003), radiotherapy (p < 0.0001), chemotherapy (p < 0.0001) and second line chemotheraphy (p = 0.02) were of positive prognostic value. On the contrary older age (> 70 years), presence of seizure at onset and additional resection after tumor recurrence did not influence OS. Multivariate analysis revealed radiotherapy (HR 0.2 p < 0.0001) and extent of surgery (HR 0.3, p = 0,0063) as positive independent prognostic factors. Patients receiving radio-chemiotherapy displayed more treatment-related toxicities with a slightly prolonged OS versus those receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy. With the limits of a retrospective study, our data suggest that in elderly fit patients extensive surgery should be considered, moreover adjuvant treatments led to an increase in OS. Randomized controlled study are needed to develop treatment guidelines for elderly GBM patients and to assess whether the combination of post-surgical radio and chemiotherapy may be superior to hypofractionated radiotherapy and chemiotherapy in fit patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

3077,"Low-dose semi-coronal CT of the sacroiliac joints in the early diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis. Background: Imaging modalities are essential for the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Radiographic sacroiliitis is the requirement of 1984 modified New York (mNY) criteria for AS but with the disadvantage of low sensitivity. MRI has the advantage of detecting active inflammatory lesions but was criticized for low specificity. Computerized tomography (CT) has higher diagnostic accuracy than radiography in detecting structural changes, but its application has been limited for high radiation dose. The reduction of radiation dose can be achieved by decreasing the tube current[1] and previous study has demonstrated that effective dose (ED) of semi-coronal sacroiliac joint (SIJ) CT is at least six times lower in female or nearly four times lower in male than that of axial SIJ CT[2]. Objective(s): To evaluate the value of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT in the early diagnosis of AS. Method(s): Thirty-three patients diagnosed by mNY criteria who had pre-existing axial SIJ CT in past two years with visible structural damage were enrolled. These patients underwent low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT examination which was obtained at 3-mm slices, 140 kV and 120 mAs, with the gantry tilted 20-25degree cranially. The ED of the low-dose semi-coronal CT and the pre-existing conventional axial CT were compared. Image qualities of the low-dose semicoronal CT were blind-graded separately by 2 rheumatologists into poor, fair, good or excellent. And the correlation between image quality and body mass index (BMI) was analyzed. The CT scans were read in a blinded manner by 2 rheumatologists who had been trained by radiologists. CT scans of the two groups were graded respectively by mNY criteria, the criteria established by Lee[3] and the Innsbruck criteria[4]. The kappa coefficient was used to assess the consistency of grading between the two groups. Result(s): Thirty-three patients received low-dose semi-coronal CT examination with an average ED of 3.37 mSv, which meant a 49% reduction in radiation compared to the pre-existing CT. The quality of images of male patients with BMI<25 kg/m2 and all female patients were good or excellent. Image qualities were assessed as poor or fair in 58% (7/12) male patients whose BMI>25 kg/m2. There was a significant negative correlation between image quality and BMI (r=-0.784,P=0.000). The grading of low-dose semi-coronal CT showed no differences as compared with the pre-existing CT by mNY criteria (see below). For the other two classification criteria, the consistency of grading between the two groups were satisfactory (kappa=0.897 by Lee criteria; kappa=0.814 by Innsbruck criteria; P>0.05). Conclusion(s): The radiation dose of low-dose semi-coronal SIJ CT was reduced significantly compared with the conventional axial SIJ CT with acceptable diagnostic efficacy.

751,"Diagnostic Radiation Exposure in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Background: Because of the chronic and relapsing nature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which often requires characterization with CT scan, IBD patients might be exposed to a large amount of radiation. As a cumulative effective dose (CED) >= 100 mSv is considered significant for stochastic risks of cancer, it is important to monitor and control the radiation exposure of the IBD patients. In the present work, we aimed to quantify the mean CED in IBD patients to assess any harmful effects of radiation., Methods: This study includes 200 IBD patients, identified retrospectively, from the outpatient clinics of the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal between January 1, 2010, and February 15, 2017, from the gastroenterologists' patients lists. The number and type of each radiology test performed were listed for each patient during the study period and the CED was calculated using our institution's dose index when available and standardized tables., Results: Among the 200 IBD patients, 157 patients had Crohn's disease (CD), 41 had ulcerative colitis (UC), and 2 had indeterminate colitis. The mean CED for IBD patients was 23.1 +/- 45.2 mSv during a mean follow-up duration of 4.3 years. CED was higher among patients with CD than with UC (27.5 +/- 49.5 versus 6.8 +/- 14.8 mSv; p<0.01). Six patients were exposed to a high CED (>100 mSv) and all had CD., Conclusion: While potentially harmful levels of radiation exposure are of concern in only a small number of patients, strategies to limit such exposure are encouraged when clinically appropriate.",Excluded
1779,"Ocular toxicity after 3D-conformal radiotherapy for non-hodgkin orbital lymphoma. Purpose: The orbital Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a rare malignancy, usually localized and low aggressive, which management requires the irradiation of whole orbital cavity. This involves structures, as lens, particularly sensible to radiation effects. This single institution study wants to evaluate the acute and late siDe effects of conformal 3D irradiation for primary NHL. Materials: We retrospectively evaluated 59 consecutive patients (20 women and 39 men, mean age 59 +/- 16 yrs) with stage IEA NHL from 1986 to 2010. The disease was localized in the left eye in 34 (58%) patients, in the right in 21 (35%), bilateral in 4 (7%), and involved the orbit in 30 (51%), the conjunctiva in 18 (31%) and other orbital structures in 11 (18%). All patients underwent 3D-conformal radiotherapy after diagnosis (by pathological or cytological examination), staging (haematological tests, total body CT, bone marrow biopsy, orbital CT or MR) and in 4 cases after chemotherapy. The median dose was 30.6 Gy (range 30-40 Gy) with a standard fractioning (1.8 Gy per day) and the PTV consisted of whole orbital cavity. The bolus (thickness 0.5-1 cm) was used only in case of superficial localizations (25%). We described acute and late toxicity incidence and calculated the risk factors for cataract, using chi-square or Fisher test as appropriate. Result(s): The mean follow up was 68.3 +/- 55 months. It was performed by clinical and radiological examinations (total body CT, lymphatic stations US) and by ophthalmic visits, every 46 months during the first 5 years and then once a year. The local control was obtained in 58 (98.3%) patients. According to the RTOG scale, the graDe (G) 1 and 2 acute effects were 37% and 24% respectively, no G3-4 were observed in 39%. Thirty-six (61%) patients had no late toxicity, 22(37%) presented low effects (G1-2) and only 1 (2%) had retinopathy and bilateral cataract (G3). The table 1 reports the adverse effects. The cataract developed in 20 (34%) patients 2-7 yrs after radiotherapy was the more common late effect. It was easily treated by surgery. We considered as possible risk factors for cataract: age >60 yrs, Karnofsky performance status < 90%, total dose > 30.6 Gy, use of bolus and chemotherapy association. Total dose > 30.6 Gy resulted significantly associated (p<0.005). Cataract was developed in 13 of 24 patients (54%) treated with dose >30.6 (median 36 Gy), in 7 of 35 (20%) with dose <= 30.6. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): 3D conformal radiotherapy was effective and well tolerated, with low-graDe acute and late toxicity, for patients with orbital lymphoma. Cataract was the more frequent siDe effect, it was associated with a total dose > 30.6 Gy and easily treated with surgery. Eyesight was well preserved.",Excluded

Purpose: We compared the diagnostic performance of CT texture analysis in single-phase CT scan with that of conventional enhancement pattern analysis in a two-phase CT scan for discrimination of salivary gland tumors, Warthin tumor (WT) from pleomorphic adenoma (PA). Method(s): One hundred seventy-eight patients with PA and 84 patients with WT were selected and CT texture analysis was separately performed on early (40s) and delayed (180s) phases, after injection of the contrast agent, using commercially available software. The attenuation changes and enhancement patterns were visually and quantitatively assessed with Hounsfield units (HU). Differences between PAs and WTs were analyzed using chi2 test and independent t test. Diagnostic performance of texture parameters in single-phase CT was compared with that of dynamic enhancement pattern in two-phase CT using the McNemar test. Result(s): Ratio of tumoral HU (delayed phase/early phase) was significantly higher in PAs compared with WTs (p < 0.001). Tumor heterogeneity parameters, standard deviation (SD) and entropy, were significantly lower in WTs regardless of the type of filter used (p <= 0.001). Mean with coarse filter (AUC = 0.944) on early phase scan and entropy with medium filter (AUC = 0.901) on delayed scan were best discriminators between PAs and WTs. Diagnostic accuracy of mean (90.5%) on early scan and entropy (84.7%) on delayed scan was not significantly different from the accuracy (89.3%) of conventional wash-out pattern for distinguishing WTs from PAs (p = 0.742, p = 0.088, respectively). Conclusion(s): Diagnostic performance of texture parameters was similar to that of quantitative enhancement pattern for differentiating WTs from PAs, with the advantage in lower radiation exposure.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2510,"Time dependent failure rate and marginal bone loss of implant supported prostheses: a 15-year follow-up study. This study deals with 4971 implants (Branemark system) installed in 1315 patients, either fully or partially edentulous, and followed from implant installation up to the last control. A predominance of female patients (61%) and a nearly equal number of upper and lower jaws characterised the study group. Patients were scheduled each 6-12 months for recall. The observation time varied from 0.5 to 15 years (mean 5.1). The whole cohort was split up into compromised (n = 59) and non-compromised (n = 1256) patients. The former are defined as grafted (autologous bone) and patients irradiated in the head and neck area. In the compromised patients 24 out of 59 patients (40.6%) showed failures, in whom 59 out of 310 (19%) implants failed. In the non-compromised patients, implant failures were observed in 11.6% of the patients, which corresponds to 5.9% of the installed implants, excluding iatrogenic failures. Failures were further divided chronologically into early (up to 1 year after abutment connection) and late failures. There were early implant failures in 12.5% of the compromised patients and in 3.4% of the others. Late implant failures occurred in 7.4 and 2% of the two patients groups, respectively. While gender did not affect the failure rate, implant lengths, corresponding to the available bone height did, since a 21.5% failure rate for the 7-mm implants contrasts with 4.1 and 3.8% for 13- and 15-mm implants, respectively. Early as well as annual late failures are more frequently found in the maxilla. Implant fractures only occurred in the fixed (both partial and full) prosthesis group but never surpassed the 0.2% annual level. Marginal bone loss, exceeding the third screw thread occurred in 1.8% of the implants at the last control. It appears that this type of implant configuration offers a high long-term predictability. Failures occur before, at or during the first year after abutment connection and in very short implants. Marginal bone as a whole is very stable over the years.",Excluded

The intracochlear positioning of the individual electrodes after cochlear implantation by means of CBCT has not yet been shown in vivo., OBJECTIVE: We describe a protocol for in vivo postoperative imaging of cochlear implants by CBCT. Moreover, the effective dose was measured and compared with the effective dose used on 4- and 16-slice multislice computed tomography (MSCT) by using a RANDO-phantom., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Developing a protocol for in vivo postoperative imaging of cochlear implants by CBCT., RESULTS: CBCT provides high-resolution and almost artifact-free multiplanar reconstruction images allowing assessment of the precise intracochlear position of the electrode and visualization of each of the individual contacts. The calculated effective dose of the used CBCT and MSCT acquisitions is 80 musv for the CBCT, 3,600 musv for the 16-slice computed tomography, and 4,800 musv for the 4-slice computed tomography., CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggests that, for in vivo postoperative evaluation of cochlear implants, CBCT can provide at least the same information as conventional radiography, digital radiograph, and MSCT but in a more comfortable and a much more safer way.",Excluded
3417,"Difference in subacute blood pressure between office and ambulatory values predicts functional outcome after ischemic stroke. Objective: Acute hypertensive response after ischemic stroke is a self-limiting phenomenon and is associated with functional outcome. Excessive BP fluctuations may reflect increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which can impair the brain repair after stroke. Whether individual BP variation, based on difference between single office and full ambulatory 24-hour BP measurements, have a distinct long-term significance for stroke outcome remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that subacute BP difference (BPD) [(office BP - mean daytime BP)/ mean daytime BP] is independently associated with stroke outcome. Design and method: In a prospective study, we included 132 patients (age 62.9 +/- 12.9, NIH Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) 7.0+/- 6.2) with acute ischemic stroke. Office (Omron) and Ambulatory BP monitoring (SpaceLabs) was performed on day 7 after stroke onset. The daytime period was defined as the interval from 6 AM to 10 PM. The relationship between these measures (adjusted for age, sex, admission neurological deficit as assessed by NIHSS score, baseline glucose level, and HR) and the 90-day poor outcome (death or dependency, modified Rankin Scale > 2) was studied using a multivariate logistic regression. Result(s): At 3 months, 28 (21.2%) patients had moderate to severe functional impairment after stroke. BPD given as a percentage was significantly higher in patients with poor outcome (14.2 +/-20.5 vs 2.0 +/-13.5; p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, high BPD (OR = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.19-2.05; p = 0.001) was significantly associated with poor stroke outcome. Age, sex, baseline neurological deficit and glucose level, thrombolytic treatment and subacute systolic BP and heart rate measured at day 7 also predicted stroke functional outcome. In multivariate analysis, the predictive value of BPD remained significant (OR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.15-3.53; p = 0.01) after adjustment for covariates. Office BP also slightly predicted stroke outcome (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.04; p = 0.04). By contrast, ambulatory BP levels had no significant predictive value after adjustment. Conclusion(s): Difference in BP between subacute office and ambulatory values is an independent predictor of functional outcome in patients after ischemic stroke. Both office and ambulatory BP reading are needed to evaluate stroke prognosis accurately. (Table Presented).",Excluded
3604,"Catheter ablation of lone atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common sustained arrhythmia in clinical practice, associated with increased mortality, risk of stroke and heart failure, as well as the reduction of the quality of life. Atrial fibrillation may be encountered in young otherwise healthy individuals, due to the isolated electrophysiological disorder limited mostly to the pulmonary veins and posterior left atrial wall, or associated with the presence of advanced underlying heart disease and numerous cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities with significant structural remodeling of the atrial myocardium. Due to limited efficacy and serious side effects of antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, based on the pulmonary vein isolation for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and adjunctive substrate modification for persistent atrial fibrillation, has emerged as an attractive and promissing alternative therapeutic option for selected patients with atrial fibrillation. In this review article, we discuss the electrophysiological left atrial abnormalities underlying lone atrial fibrillation and the role of pulmonary veins in pathophysiology of arrhythmia, and we summarize results of the studies on the long term outcome of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, as well as the studies on comparison of antiarrhythmic drugs with catheter ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation. In addition, we present available data that provide better understanding of mechanisms, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of specific procedure-related complications and discuss current periprocedural anticoagulation strategies and their impact on the thromboembolic risk reduction.Copyright © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

2152,"Assessment of the degradation rates and effectiveness of different coated Mg-Zn-Ca alloy scaffolds for in vivo repair of critical-size bone defects. Surgical repair of bone defects remains challenging, and the search for alternative procedures is ongoing. Devices made of Mg for bone repair have received much attention owing to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded
1020,"Can Radiation Dose Burden of CT Angiography be Reduced While Still Accurately Diagnosing Etiology of Acute Chest Pain?. Background: Multidetector-row computed tomography is often used as a first-line test in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases including aortic dissection, coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism. This study evaluated the impact of reducing the tube potential from 120 kVp to 100 kVp in a selected group of patients presenting to the Emergency Room with acute chest pain. The primary end point was how the reduction of radiation dose affected image quality. Method(s): The current study was performed over a period of 2 years between July, 2016 and July, 2018. This study included patients who presented to the Emergency Room or to an outpatient clinic and were suspected to have a coronary, a pulmonary (pulmonary embolism), or an aortic (aortic dissection) etiology. Suspicion was determined by the medical provider based on clinical picture, EKG, and lab results when available. All patients were referred for computed tomography angiography (CTA) testing as part of their diagnostic evaluation. A total of 84 patients were involved in the study. Seventy of the patients underwent the low acquisition Kvp technique (100 Kvp - Group I). In the remaining 14 patients, the standard acquisition technique (120-140 Kvp - Group II) was utilized. Result(s): This study showed the feasibility of using low energy CTA to significantly reduce the patient's radiation exposure without markedly affecting the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion(s): The use of low energy CTA protocols in cases of acute chest pain revealed no major difference regarding the image quality with marked reduction of the radiation dose received by the patient.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2953,"INTRAOPERATIVE CHOLANGIOGRAPHY DURING CHOLECYSTECTOMY RESULTS IN LOW EXPOSURE TO RADIATION: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. This study aimed to determine the exposure to radiation delivered to the patient during routine intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) in cholecystectomy and examine the factors affecting radiation dose and fluoroscopy time (FT). From January 2016 to December 2017, 598 IOC examinations were performed. This study included 324 intraoperative cholangiographies performed with c-arm equipment not exceeding 10 years of age. When residents performed the procedures, the mean kerma area product (KAP) was 0.36 (standard deviation [SD] 0.70) Gycm 2 and in specialist surgeons group 0.36 (SD 0.47) Gycm2, P = 0.47. In residents group, the mean FT was 11.4 (SD 10.1) seconds and in specialist surgeons group, 9.2 (SD 11.9) seconds, P < 0.01. Linear regression analysis showed association between increased KAP-values and the presence of common bile duct (CBD) stones and body mass index (BMI). Age, BMI, laparoscopic surgery, acute cholecystitis, presence of CBD stones, resident surgeon performing IOC and ASA III-IV were associated with higher FT. National diagnostic reference level for IOC has not been introduced in Finland so far. Our mean KAP values (0.36 Gycm2) were 3-4 times lower and FT (10.1 seconds) were 3-5 times lower than the few reported in the literature. Routine use of IOC during cholecystectomy results in relatively low-radiation dose performed either by residents or specialist surgeons, irrespective of whether CBD stones were visualized or not.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.

2728,"Medulloblastoma in adults: A retrospective review of prognostic factors and treatment outcomes. Purpose/Objective(s): To assess the outcomes for adult patients treated for medulloblastoma at a large academic center. Materials/Methods: Wereviewed our experience in treating adult (age.18) patientswith a diagnosis ofmedulloblastoma. Information was gathered retrospectively on 66 patients who were seen at the time of initial diagnosis at our institution from1969 to 2008. Pathology was reviewed at the time of this analysis for all patients with available slides.Median age was 33. 44 patients hadM0 disease, 9 had M1, and 13were classified asMX.31 patientswere classified as high risk, 31 as standard risk and 4 patients had incomplete information for risk stratification. Classic histology was the most common type (n = 40) followed by desmoplastic (n = 9) and large cell/ anaplastic (n = 1). Radiation information was available in 64 patients. 61 received craniospinal radiotherapy (median dose 36 Gy) and 62 received posterior fossa radiotherapy (median total dose 55 Gy). 28 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy which was most commonly cisplatin based. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS)were estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves.Any recurrence or deathwas counted as an event in the estimation of PFS. Cox regression analysiswas used to compare recurrences between different groups (only patients that recurred were counted as having an event). The effect of chemotherapy in different groups was also assessed. Result(s):Median follow-upwas 80months. The estimated 5-yearOS and PFSwas 74%and 59%, respectively.High risk classification was associatedwithworseOS (p= 0.03) and recurrence (HR2.56, p= 0.05) and trend forworse PFS(p= 0.1313). Five-yearOSand PFS was 61% and 49% for high-risk, compared to 86% and 69% for patients classified as standard risk. Gross total resection (GTR) was associatedwith an improvement inOS (p = 0.03) and a trend toward improved PFS (p = 0.09) compared to subtotal resection or biopsy. No significant differenceswere observed for gender, location (midline vs. lateral), radiation dose, histologic type, anaplasia extent, treatment era or use ofMRI for staging.No benefit for chemotherapy could be demonstrated for the group as a whole. For high risk patients with classic histology (n= 25), chemotherapywas associatedwith animprovement in 5 year PFS from36%to 71%(p = 0.10 by log-rank and 0.05 by Wilcoxon test) and an improvement in 5 year OS from 49% to 100% (p = 0.08 by log-rank and 0.04 by Wilcoxon test). Conclusion(s): In adult patients with medulloblastoma, extent of resection and risk group are predictors of outcome. No significant difference in outcomes was observed by treatment era. These exploratory results suggest a possible benefit for chemotherapy in the group of high risk patients with classic histology.",Excluded
623,"Additional myeloablation with 52Fe before bone marrow transplantation. For many hematological malignancies, high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation offers the best and sometimes the only chance for cure. However, the main causes of failure of this therapy are relapse and toxicity. In order to selectively deliver higher doses of radiotherapy to the bone marrow and to spare normal organs, we explored 52Fe therapy before a conventional BMT conditioning regimen. Twenty-four patients at high risk for relapse after BMT were included in a phase II study. The median follow-up was 42 months. The median 52Fe dose was 59 mCi. This resulted in a median radiation-absorbed dose (RAD) to the BM of 626 rad. The median RAD to the liver was 338 rad. No untoward effects were noted after the injections of 52Fe. The patients recovered hematopoiesis without toxicity in excess of that expected with conventional conditioning alone. The 3-year DFS probability was 49% (95% CI: 20-78%), Eight patients have relapsed,three of them in extramedullary sites. 52Fe should provide a way to boost the radiation dose to marrow-based diseases before bone marrow transplantation without excessive toxicity.",Excluded
2778,"Impact of low dose myocardial perfusion imaging on patient radiation effective dose and imaging time in real world clinical practice. Objectives To demonstrate proof of concept/practicality of reducing medical radiation exposure from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by adopting low dose protocols in real world clinical practice. Methods A cohort of 100 consecutive patients who were referred for MPI to our nuclear medicine service was imaged with a low dose rest-stress MPI protocol. Traditionally used doses of 10 millicuries (mCi) or 370 megabecquerel (MBq) at rest and 30 mCi (1110 MBq) at stress were decreased to half for the low dose protocol, 5 mCi (185 MBq) at rest and 15 mCi (555MBq) at stress. This decision was based on the principle of lowering the injected dose as much as practically feasible while obtaining good diagnostic quality images with similar 1 million count threshold for image acquisition in a reasonable, patient comfortable imaging time [1]. All imaging was performed using an ultrafast, high resolution, dedicated cardiac camera (D-SPECT, Spectrum Dynamics) [2] in upright position for rest and stress. An additional supine stress image was additionally acquired [3]. The low dose patient cohort was retrospectively compared to a cohort of 100 consecutive patients referred to our service for MPI who were imaged using the traditional dose protocol immediately preceding the adoption of the low dose protocol. Comparison between the two groups in different protocols was made using the average values of administered doses in mCi, radiation effective dose in millisieverts (mSv) and the imaging time in minutes: seconds for each rest, stress and total MPI. All patients were imaged using a single day, rest-stress protocol with technetium99m-sestamibi using either exercise or pharmacological stress as determined clinically by the cardiology team. Results A total of 200 patients with 100 patients in each cohort were evaluated. Traditional dose patients had an average age of 69.8 years (y), male: female ratio of 59:41, weight of 85 kilograms (kg), received a dose of 10.4 mCi (385 MBq) at rest, 31.1 mCi (1151 MBq) at stress. Low dose patients had an average age of 66.6 y, male: female ratio of 52:48, weighed 83.3 kg, and received a dose of 5.28 mCi (195 MBq) at rest, 16.0 mCi (592 MBq) at stress. High dose imaging time in minutes: seconds was 8:17 (rest), 1:46 (stress) and 10:03 (total). Low dose imaging time was 14:36 (rest), 3:24 (stress) and 18:00 (total). As compared to traditional dose protocols, low dose protocols demonstrated significant reduction in average radiation effective dose of 49.1% in rest, 48.5% in stress and 48.7% in total rest-stress MPI. As expected, an increase in imaging time was noted in the low dose protocol, with an average increase of 07:20 min in rest, 03:14 min in stress and 10:34 min in total imaging time, which did not significantly impact patient throughput. No patient complaints were encountered with regards to imaging time by the imaging team. All images were of diagnostic quality, acquired by identical parameters of 1 million count threshold for image acquisition and deemed clinically interpretable by a team of board certified clinical nuclear medicine providers. Conclusions MPI contributes significantly to medical radiation exposure [4]. Low dose MPI can be easily implemented clinically using newer high resolution cardiac specific cameras to achieve markedly lower radiation effective doses to the patient population without significantly impacting patient throughput or diagnostic quality of images. Low dose MPI leads to decreasing medical radiation exposure to the patients, their caregivers, medical staff [5] and to the community as a whole.",Excluded
366,"Colostomy is a simple and effective procedure for severe chronic radiation proctitis. AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of diverting colostomy in treating severe hemorrhagic chronic radiation proctitis (CRP)., METHODS: Patients with severe hemorrhagic CRP who were admitted from 2008 to 2014 were enrolled into this study. All CRP patients were diagnosed by a combination of pelvic radiation history, clinical rectal bleeding, and endoscopic findings. Inclusion criteria were CRP patients with refractory bleeding with moderate to severe anemia with a hemoglobin level < 90 g/L. The study group included patients who were treated by diverting colostomy, while the control group included patients who received conservative treatment. The remission of bleeding was defined as complete cessation or only occasional bleeding that needed no further treatment. The primary outcome was bleeding remission at 6 mo after treatment. Quality of life before treatment and at follow-up was evaluated according to EORTC QLQ C30. Severe CRP complications were recorded during follow-up., RESULTS: Forty-seven consecutive patients were enrolled, including 22 in the colostomy group and 27 in the conservative treatment group. When compared to conservative treatment, colostomy obtained a higher rate of bleeding remission (94% vs 12%), especially in control of transfusion-dependent bleeding (100% vs 0%), and offered a better control of refractory perianal pain (100% vs 0%), and a lower score of bleeding (P < 0.001) at 6 mo after treatment. At 1 year after treatment, colostomy achieved better remission of both moderate bleeding (100% vs 21.5%, P = 0.002) and severe bleeding (100% vs 0%, P < 0.001), obtained a lower score of bleeding (0.8 vs 2.0, P < 0.001), and achieved obvious elevated hemoglobin levels (P = 0.003), when compared to the conservative treatment group. The quality of life dramatically improved after colostomy, which included global health, function, and symptoms, but it was not improved in the control group. Pathological evaluation after colostomy found diffused chronic inflammation cells, and massive fibrosis collagen depositions under the rectal wall, which revealed potential fibrosis formation., CONCLUSION: Diverting colostomy is a simple, effective and safe procedure for severe hemorrhagic CRP. Colostomy can improve quality of life and reduce serious complications secondary to radiotherapy.",Excluded
1571,"Retroparotid transmasseteric approach to condylar fracture through mini- retromandibular access. Statement of the Problem: The incidence of condylar fractures amongst mandibular fractures is between 17.5% and 52%. Almost 50% of condylar fractures have other associated fractures and 80% of them are unilateral fractures. Most are not caused by direct trauma but from indirect forces transmitted to condyle from elsewhere. Broadly there are 2 types of fractures, intracapsular and extracapsular, but for diagnostic and practical reasons it has been divided into 3 categories: condylar head (intracapsular), the condylar neck (extracapsular) and the subcondylar fractures. They are classified as: undisplaced, deviated, displaced (with medial or lateral overlap) and dislocated. The management of mandibular condylar fractures remains controversial. A wide spectrum of management is seen from plain analgesic, to physiotherapy, intermaxillary fixation and open reduction with internal fixation. Over the past decade better understanding of biological considerations of condylar fractures, improved surgical facilities and skills have tilted the balance in favor of open reduction. Open reduction is usually carried out by extra-oral approach such as preauricular, submandibular and retromandibular. Various modifications have been proposed for retromandibular approach like transparotid, transmasseter, high cervical transmasseteric anteroparotid, and mini retromandibular. This talk will present our experience with the retro-parotid transmasseteric approach to condylar fractures through mini-retromandibular access. This approach minimizes nerve injury and provides good access. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2004 to 2010 a total number of 46 patients with a total of 51 condylar process fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. Male patients were 36 and female 10 with an age range from 18 years to 52 years. Mean age was 32 years. The mechanism of injury was either motor vehicle accident, falls or assault. 7 cases were high condylar neck fractures, 28 low condylar neck and 16 were subcondylar fractures. Bilateral condylar fractures were 5. Condylar fractures associated mid-face fractures were 6, mandibular ramus and coronoid process 1, mandibular body and parasymphysis 29 and isolated condyle 15. Diagnosis was made on clinical and radiographic pictures, making use of panorex views, mandibular series x-rays and coronal CT scans. Indication for surgery included shortened posterior mandibular height, premature contact of molar teeth, presence of malocclusion like crossbite and anterior open bite and patient willingness through informed consent. All patients were operated on using retroparotid tranamasseteric approach through mini retromandibular incision measuring between 1.5 to 2 cm. Maximum follow-up period was 4 years. Methods of Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics, Minitab 13. Results of Investigation: Good results were achieved. Posterior mandibular height was restored in all except one. No mandibular deviation was observed on opening in 45 patients. Occlusion and range of mandibular motion was found to be satisfactory. Facial symmetry was achieved in all patients. Transient facial nerve injury was noted in 4 patients which completely resolved in 6 to 8 weeks. One patient with bilateral facture encountered postop infection on one side which was treated with antibiotics. Salivary fistula was present in 2 patients treated conservatively. Temporoandibular joint pain was reported by 3 patients of whom 2 were known to have nocturnal buxism. Condylar dislocation post ORIF was seen in 1 patient who experienced an epileptic fit. One plate was found fractured on a review appointment 12 weeks postop. All patients had minimally visible scar. Conclusion(s): Open reduction of condylar fractures through retroparotid transmasseteric approach via miniretromandibular access provides adequate exposure and reduction, minimal nerve injury and minimal visible scar.",Excluded
2943,"Long-Term Clinical Outcome of First Recurrence Skull Base Meningiomas. Skull base meningiomas (SBMs) are considered to be less aggressive and have a slower growth rate than non-SBMs. However, SBMs often develop local recurrences after surgical resection. Gross total removal is difficult because SBMs are deep-seated tumors and involve critical neurovascular structures. The treatment strategy for recurrent SBMs remains controversial. The present study aimed to evaluate the long-term clinical course and prognostic factors associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) of recurrent SBMs. This retrospective study included 85 recurrent SBMs from 65 patients who underwent surgery from January 2005 to September 2018. Overall survival (OS) and PFS were evaluated, and the associations among shorter PFS and age, sex, tumor size, lesions, World Health Organization (WHO) grading, removal rate, and time since prior surgery were analyzed. The median follow-up period for PFS was 68 months. The 2-, 5-, and 10-year PFS rates were 68.0%, 52.8%, and 22.7%, respectively. WHO grade II or III, multiple lesions, and tumor size were significantly associated with shorter PFS (p < 0.0001, p = 0.030, and p = 0.173, respectively). Although, radiotherapy did not improve PFS and OS for overall patients, PFS of the patients with subtotal and partial removal for WHO grade II SBMs was significantly improved by the radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis identified WHO grade II or III and multiple lesions as independent prognostic factors for shorter PFS (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.040, respectively). It is essential to estimate the risks associated with shorter PFS for patients with recurrent SBMs to aid in the development of appropriate postoperative strategies.",Excluded
1198,"Trans sodium crocetinate with temozolomide and radiation therapy for glioblastoma multiforme. obJective A new drug, trans sodium crocetinate (TSC), has been developed to enhance the delivery of oxygen to hypoxic tissues. Cancerous tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are very hypoxic, and it has been suggested that radiation therapy (RT) is more beneficial if tumors are better oxygenated. A Phase I/II clinical trial was conducted to determine the effect of adding TSC to RT sessions. MethoDs An open, single-arm clinical trial incorporating the standard of care (SOC) for GBM was conducted at 18 clinical sites. There were 6 weeks of RT consisting of 2 Gy/day for 5 days/week, beginning after an initial resection or stereotactic biopsy to confirm GBM. Temozolomide (TMZ), 75 mg/m2, was given before each RT session. The TSC, 0.25 mg/kg, was intravenously administered around 45 minutes before an RT session 3 days/week, usually on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. A Phase I run-in period included 2 cohorts. The first cohort contained 3 patients who were given a half dose of the intravenous TSC (that is, 0.25 mg/kg, 3 times per week for only the first 3 weeks of RT). After a Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) had verified that no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) had occurred, a second cohort of 6 patients was given the same dosage of TSC but for the full 6 weeks of RT. After the SMC verified that no DLTs had occurred, Phase II began, with the administration of the full 18 doses of TSC. Fifty additional patients were enrolled during Phase II. Following the completion of RT, the patients rested for a month. After that, SOC TMZ chemotherapy (150-200 mg/m2) was administered for 5 days of the 1st week of 6 monthly cycles. No TSC was administered during this chemotherapy phase or later in the trial. Any other follow-up therapies were administered at the discretion of the individual investigators. resUlts Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 36% of the full-dose TSC patients were alive at 2 years, compared with historical survival values ranging from 27% to 30% for the SOC. Survival for the biopsy-only subset of patients was 40%, as compared with 42.9% for those patients having a complete resection before treatment. In addition, 2 of the 3 Phase I, Cohort 1 patients survived at 2 years. Contrast MRI data suggested that considerable pseudoprogression had occurred. Both Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scores and quality of life (QOL) questionnaires indicated that a good quality of life existed for most patients throughout the trial. No serious adverse events occurring in the trial were attributed to TSC. conclUsions This trial contained a single arm consisting of 59 patients. The results strongly suggested that adding TSC during RT is beneficial for the treatment of GBM. Trans sodium crocetinate offers a novel, easily implemented way to combat hypoxia in tumor tissue.Copyright © AANS, 2017",Excluded

In this prospective National Cancer Institute-funded American College of Radiology Imaging Network/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cooperative group trial, we hypothesized that standardized uptake value (SUV) on post-treatment [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) correlates with survival in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded

Cases were those diagnosed with lung cancer over 6 years of follow-up (n = 108). Two controls, matched on age and sex, were selected for each case by incidence density sampling. Of the three polymorphisms, only the XRCC1 Arg280His allele was associated with increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) after adjustment for radon and tobacco exposure. In addition, individuals with the variant Arg280His allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at higher risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype. Conversely, individuals with the variant Arg194Trp allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at lower risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype.

526,"Relative dose and vascular response after drug-eluting stent implantation: A dosimetric 3D-intravascular ultrasound study. Background In drug-eluting stents (DESs), the theoretical drug dose exposed to the vessel wall per stent surface area may vary due to the fixed loading dose and differences in the stent surface area once expanded in varying vessel sizes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential effects of different dose intensities, as estimated by 3D-IVUS dosimetry, on vascular response after DES implantation. Methods Follow-up (6-9 months) 3D-IVUS was performed in 840 coronary lesions treated with a single DES of the following types: sirolimus (SES, n = 148), paclitaxel (PES, n = 162), Endeavor zotarolimus (E-ZES, n = 233), Resolute zotarolimus (R-ZES, n = 147), and everolimus (EES, n = 150). Volume index (volume/length, mm3/mm) was obtained for vessel, lumen, plaque, stent, and neointima. In each lesion, exposed dose intensity was calculated as known loading dose divided by measured luminal surface area of the stented segment. Lesions were divided into tertiles based on the exposed dose intensity: high, medium, and low dose groups. Results The exposed dose intensity ranged 0.74-1.76 mug/mm2 for SES, 0.41-1.18 mug/mm2 for PES, 0.71-1.57 mug/mm2 for E-ZES, 0.72-1.63 mug/mm2 for R-ZES, and 0.40-0.99 mug/mm2 for EES. All types of DES showed no significant difference in neointimal hyperplasia among the 3 groups, except that E-ZES showed significantly less neointimal hyperplasia in the high dose group. Conclusions Detailed 3D-IVUS revealed significant lesion-to-lesion variability in dose intensity exposed to the vessel wall following DES implantation. However, the major types of DES appear to yield equally effective neointimal suppression, despite the varying dose intensity, except for E-ZES.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

For electron and beta sources uniformly distributed within internal organs, the mean dose from self-irradiation is noted to scale inversely with organ mass, provided no escape of electron energy occurs at the organ boundaries. In the skeleton, this same scaling approach is further assumed to be correct for marrow dosimetry; nevertheless, difficulties in quantitative assessments of marrow mass in specific skeletal regions of the patient make this approach difficult to implement clinically. Instead, scaling of marrow dose is achieved using various anthropometric parameters that presumably scale in the same proportion. In this study, recently developed three-dimensional macrostructural transport models of the femoral head and humeral epiphysis in three individuals (51-year male, 82-year female, and 86-year female) are used to test the abilities of different anthropometric parameters (total body mass, body surface area, etc.) to properly scale radionuclide S values from reference man models. The radionuclides considered are 33P, 177Lu, 153Sm, 186Re, 89Sr, 166Ho, 32P, 188Re, and 90Y localized in either the active marrow or endosteal tissues of the bone trabeculae. S value scaling is additionally conducted in which the 51-year male subject is assigned as the reference individual; scaling parameters are then expanded to include tissue volumes and masses for both active marrow and skeletal spongiosa. The study concludes that, while no single anthropometric parameter emerges as a consistent scaler of reference man S values, lean body mass is indicated as an optimal scaler when the reference S values are based on 3D transport techniques. Furthermore, very exact patient-specific scaling of radionuclide S values can be achieved if measurements of spongiosa volume and marrow volume fraction (high-resolution CT with image segmentation) are known in both the patient and the reference individual at skeletal sites for which dose estimates are sought. However, the study indicates that measurements of the spongiosa volume alone may be sufficient for reasonable patient-specific scaling of S values for the majority of radionuclides of interest in internal-emitter therapy. © 2002 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Excluded
2971,"Management of choroidal melanomas with linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery. Purpose: To discuss the technical aspect, dose prescription, clinical results, and biological responsiveness of linear accelerator-based stereotactic radiosurgery for choroidal melanoma. Method(s): From March 1995 to December 1995, three choroidal melanoma patients were treated with Linac-based radiosurgery in our department. Two patients underwent one dose of radiosurgery with 18 and 20 Gy in single fraction, respectively. The third patient received two doses of radiosurgery with a total dose of 35 Gy. Result(s): Follow-up time ranged from 19 to 25 months (median: 24 months). One patient had near-total regression, while the other two patients had partial response on the last MR images. Visual acuity was deteriorated in all patients. One patient developed a radiation-induced cataract in the treated eye. Conclusion(s): Linac-based radiosurgery is technically feasible for management of choroidal melanoma. Although visual acuity was not improved in these patients, they appreciated the preserving of the eyeball without affecting their general appearance.",Excluded
362,"Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy to distal ureteric stones: The transgluteal approach significantly increases stone-free rates. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) can be used to treat stones at any position within the ureter, as long as the stone is radio-opaque and there is a path for the shockwave to reach the stone. However the results of SWL to distal ureteric calculi, with the patient in a prone position, were inferior to those of treating stones within the upper ureter. The transguteal approach allows the lithotripsy shockwave to reach the lower ureter via the greater selatle foramen. This study shows that this approach for SWL to distal ureteric calculi is more effective than the prone approach. Objective To compare the outcomes of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) for distal ureteric stones treated using the prone and transgluteal (supine) approaches in a tertiary referral stone unit using a fourth generation lithotriptor. Patients and Methods We selected consecutive patients undergoing ESWL to distal ureteric stones over 1 year, during which we changed our treatment protocol from a prone to transgluteal (supine) approach. Patients were treated using the Sonolith Vision Lithotriptor (Technomed Medical Systems, Vaulx-en-Velin, France). Outcome was assessed using plain abdominal film of kidney, ureter and bladder (KUB) X-ray taken at 2 weeks then monthly as required. Treatment success was defined as complete clearance of stone fragments and treatment failure was defined as persistence of stone fragments beyond 3 months or the need for ureteroscopy. Results A total of 38 patients were treated in the prone position and 72 patients using a transgluteal approach. Patient and stone characteristics were identical in both groups. The mean (range) stone size was 7.8 (4-16) mm. The proportions of patients who were stone-free after one treatment session within the prone and transgluteal treatment groups were 40 and 78%, respectively (<0.001). The overall success rates for treatment within the prone and transgluteal groups were 63 and 92%, respectively (<0.001). Conclusions Transgluteal ESWL to stones within the distal ureter leads to significantly higher stone-free rates than treatment using the prone approach. The majority of patients are rendered stone-free after one session of treatment and the overall success rates are similar to those of ureteroscopic management. © 2013 BJU International.",Excluded
399,"Incidence of radiation retinopathy after high-dosage single-fraction gamma knife radiosurgery for choroidal melanoma. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence and clinical findings of radiation retinopathy after single-fraction high-dose gamma knife radiosurgery for choroidal melanoma., DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative interventional case series., PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two patients with choroidal melanoma., METHODS: Review of charts, color fundus photographs, and fluorescein angiograms of 32 choroidal melanoma patients after radiosurgery. All patients were treated with the Leksell gamma knife in one fraction with a marginal dose between 40 and 80 Gy (median, 50 Gy) and were followed for at least 24 months (or until enucleation because of complications secondary to radiation)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any clinical feature of radiation retinopathy and neovascular glaucoma., RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 38 months (range, 6-81 months) we found radiation retinopathy in 84% of our patients. The most common findings in these patients were intraretinal hemorrhages with an incidence of 70%, macular edema and capillary nonperfusion in 63%, and hard exudates in 52% of the patients. Less common were microaneurysms in 30% and retinal neovascularization in 22%. The time of onset of the various radiation-associated retinal findings ranged between 1 and 22 months. Forty-seven percent of all patients developed neovascular glaucoma. In our study there was no correlation between radiation dosage applied and clinical findings., CONCLUSIONS: Single-fraction high-dose Leksell gamma knife radiosurgery of choroidal melanomas with a median marginal dose of 50 Gy is highly associated with early radiation retinopathy and with neovascular glaucoma.",Excluded
731,"Clinical analysis of concurrent 3DCRT and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in elderly patients. Aim: To probe into the clinical effects of concurrent 3DCRT (3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy) and XELOX treatment for postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma in the elderly patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-seven elderly patients with postoperative local recurrence of rectal carcinoma were randomly divided into a clinical group and a control group. The clinical group had 31 patients, who received 6 Mv X-ray 3DCRT, 2 Gy per time, 5 times every week. After radiotherapy for the total pelvis until target dose (DT) in tumor focus reached 40 Gy/20f, the tumor focus was intensified up to DT 60-64 Gy with 8 Mv X-ray DT 20-24 Gy. During radiotherapy, the patients were treated with XELOX (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2, dl, Xeloda 850 mg/m2, p.o. d1-14) for two periods. The control group had 26 pa tients, who were only treated with XELOX. Result(s): The responder rate (RR) of the clinical group was 87.1%. The survival rates within 1, 2 and 3 years were 67.7%, 51.6% and 41.9% respectively, which were higher than the control group (p < 0.05). However, the clinical group had significantly more 1st and 2nd degree myelosuppression and hand-foot syndrome. The symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment.

3308,"Outcomes and toxicity following Yttrium-90 radioembolization for hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors-a single-institution experience. Background: The prognosis of patients with hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is generally good, and radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres is a locoregional therapy that is used in efforts to improve hepatic disease control and survival. This study aims to describe the survival outcomes and toxicities associated with radioembolization for hepatic-predominant metastatic NET in a large single-institution cohort. Method(s): A total of 59 patients underwent radioembolization for metastatic NET with hepatic predominant disease at a single academic center. Patient outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and toxicities were detailed and described. Ten patients within the cohort underwent post-treatment dosimetric analysis using PET-MRI and normal liver dosimetry was correlated with hepatic fibrosis and toxicity. Result(s): Median overall survival from time of radioembolization in the patient cohort was 31 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival was 80.4% and 65.6% respectively. Median hepatic progression-free survival and overall progression-free survival were 18 and 13 months, respectively. Three patients died of hepatic failure that was possibly therapy-related. Ten patients underwent evaluation of post-treatment dosimetry following radioembolization. In patients who did not develop hepatotoxicity or hepatic fibrosis, mean dose to normal liver was 25.4 Gy, while the mean liver dose in patients who experienced toxicity (hepatic fibrosis in n=2 and death from hepatic failure in n=1) was 59.1 Gy. Conclusion(s): Overall survival following radioembolization for hepatic metastases from NET is excellent; however, deaths that are potentially treatment-related have been observed. Preliminary data regarding dose to normal liver is suggestive of a relation between dosimetry and toxicity, however further work is required to further elucidate the mechanism, correlation with dosimetry, as well as additional patient and tumor factors that may predispose these patients to toxicity.Copyright © Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

1543,"Cone beam computerized tomography: basics for digital planning in oral surgery and implantology. For the diagnosis of bone pathology, planning of complex implant-supported prosthetic restorations, and guaranteeing oral surgery that is as safe and free of complications as possible, a three-dimensional radiological display is frequently indicated. Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), which can cover a large part of the indications of the dental and oral surgical spectrum, represents an alternative to computed tomography. Moreover, the method offers the advantage that it can also be used in the dental practice, taking the existing radiation protection regulations into account. This guarantees optimum patient and user friendliness, because referral to a specialized CT facility is thus no longer necessary in most cases. In the first 12 months of the trials of the Planmeca Promax 3D at the Department of Dental Surgery and Radiology of the University Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Medicine in Graz, the overwhelming majority of referrals for CBCT (almost 90%) was concerned with the field of oral surgery and implantology. Oral surgical questions mainly covered aspects of wisdom tooth anatomy, position of impacted canines, premolars, and mesiodents, as well as cystic lesions. Diagnoses of the maxillary sinuses and the area of tooth preservation represented further indications. Apart from diagnostic purposes, the objective of the referrals was facilitating optimum preparation for the pending operation. In the area of implantology, this was combined frequently with pre- or post-augmentative three-dimensional digital therapy planning. CBCT showed good results in the display of hard tissue structures and can be integrated without difficulty in the daily clinical routine.",Excluded
57,"Randomized Phase II Study of Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy +/- Panitumumab Followed by Consolidation Chemotherapy in Potentially Operable Locally Advanced (Stage IIIa, N2+) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: NRG Oncology RTOG 0839. Introduction Multimodality therapy has curative potential in locally advanced NSCLC. Mediastinal nodal sterilization (MNS) after induction chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can serve as an intermediate marker for efficacy. NRG Oncology Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0229 demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of combining full-dose radiation (61.2 Gy) with chemotherapy followed by resection and chemotherapy. On the basis of that experience and evidence that EGFR antibodies are radiosensitizing, we explored adding panitumumab to CRT followed by resection and consolidation chemotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC with a primary end point of MNS. Methods Patients with resectable locally advanced NSCLC were eligible if deemed suitable for trimodality therapy before treatment. Surgeons were required to demonstrate expertise after CRT and adhere to specific management guidelines. Concurrent CRT consisted of weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 2.0), paclitaxel (50 mg/m2), and 60 Gy of radiation therapy delivered in 30 fractions. There was a 2:1 randomization in favor of panitumumab at 2.5 mg/kg weekly for 6 weeks. The mediastinum was pathologically reassessed before or at the time of resection. Consolidation chemotherapy was weekly carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) and paclitaxel, 200 mg/m2 every 21 days for two courses. The study was designed to detect an improvement in MNS from 52% to 72%. With use of a 0.15 one-sided type 1 error and 80% power, 97 patients were needed. Results The study was opened in November 2010 and closed in August 2015 by the Data Monitoring Committee after 71 patients had been accrued for futility and excessive toxicity in the experimental arm. A total of 60 patients were eligible: 19 patients (86%) who received CRT and 29 (76%) who received CRT plus panitumumab and underwent an operation. With regard to postoperative toxicity, there were three grade 4 adverse events (13.6%) and no grade 5 adverse events (0%) among those who received CRT versus six grade 4 (15.8%) and four grade 5 adverse events (10.5%) among those who received CRT plus panitumumab. The MNS rates were 68.2% (95% confidence interval: 45.1-86.1) and 50.0% (95% confidence interval: 33.4-66.6) for CRT and CRT plus panitumumab, respectively (p = 0.95). Conclusion The addition of panitumumab to CRT did not improve MNS. There was an unexpectedly high mortality rate in the panitumumab arm, although the relationship to panitumumab is unclear. The control arm had outcomes similar to those in NRG Oncology RTOG 0229.Copyright © 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",Excluded

1174,"Molecular basis of basal cell carcinogenesis in the atomic-bomb survivor population: p53 and PTCH gene alterations. Epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure from sunlight is the major etiology for skin cancers, both melanocytic and non-melanocytic. However, the radiation-related risk for skin cancer among atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is primarily derived from the excess risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), with no demonstrable excess in squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. The BCCs in this cohort are therefore unusual in being potentially attributable to two types of radiation - UV and ionizing (IR). BCCs have been associated with PTCH and/or p53 tumor suppressor gene alterations. To investigate the roles of these genes in relation to IR and UV exposures, we analyzed both genes in BCC samples from atomic bomb survivors. We examined 47 tumors, of which 70% had non-silent base-substitution p53 mutations independent of IR or UV exposure. However, the distribution of mutation type depends on UV and/or IR exposure. For example, C-to-T transitions at CpG sites adjacent to pyrimidine-pyrimidine (PyPy) sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-exposed than UV-shielded body areas and CpG-mutations at non-PyPy sequences were more prevalent in tumors from UV-shielded body areas with high-IR (>=1 Gy) than low-IR (<0.2 Gy) exposure. And notably, although p53 deletion-frequencies demonstrated no IR-dose associations, deletions at the PTCH locus were more frequent (79% versus 44%) in tumors with high-IR than low-IR exposure. Moreover, 60% of high-IR tumors harbored both p53 and PTCH abnormalities compared with 23% of low-IR tumors. Therefore, alteration of both genes is likely to play a role in radiation-induced basal cell carcinogenesis. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of autologous platelet and plasma adhesives (APA) on postoperative drainage and soft-tissue fibrosis following neck dissections., DESIGN: This was a blinded comparative prospective cohort study done as two parts: part one evaluated early post-surgical outcomes and part two evaluated late tissue fibrosis., METHOD: Salvage neck dissections were stratified into two groups based on severity of prior treatment. High risk patients were defined as those who had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and autologous platelet adhesives were administered to the surgical wound intraoperatively. The low risk group consisted of patients undergoing salvage neck dissections following radiation only and acted as controls. Part one evaluated postsurgical wound drainage as the primary outcome as well as length of hospital stay and complications. Part two evaluated late postoperative tissue fibrosis by comparing neck skin using the Cutometer.

INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of changes in oxygen consumption during reduced body weight loading at different speed levels is important, in particular in astronauts who may lose aerobic fitness as well as in clinical patients (e.g., in obese individuals at walking speeds or in injured athletes at running speeds). Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze oxygen consumption during unloaded walking and running., METHODS: Oxygen consumption (Vo2), heart rate (HR), and Borg rating of perceived exertion (Borg RPE) were quantified in 10 healthy young female and male volunteers at 3 body weight (BW) conditions (100%, 66%, and 33% BW) and 4 treadmill speeds (slow walking at 0.4 m x s(-1), comfortable walking at 1.3 m x s(-1), slow running at 2.2 m x s(-1), and moderately fast running at 3.1 m x s(-1)). Unloading was achieved in a waist-high chamber with increased pressure called Lower Body Positive Pressure (LBPP)., RESULTS: All parameters (Vo2, HR, and Borg RPE) decreased during unloaded walking and running. Interestingly, our findings confirm a specific linear relationship between each parameter and treadmill speed for each BW condition with smaller slope angles at higher levels of unloading (e.g., for Vo2, the slope angle decreased from 11.9 at 100% BW to 4.4 at 33% BW)., DISCUSSION: Oxygen consumption, heart rate, and Borg rating of perceived exertion are reduced during unloaded exercise with a relatively greater decline at higher treadmill speeds. That is, the higher the treadmill's speed in unloaded conditions, the relatively easier"" it is to exercise.""",Excluded

Patients' demographic characteristics, clinical data, laboratory findings and treatment parameters were analyzed to determine the predictive factors associated with progression from radiological RP to symptomatic RP., RESULTS: Forty-seven patients (77%) exhibited radiological RP at a median of 78 days after radiation therapy (RT) completion, and 15 (32%) of these patients developed symptomatic RP. The interval between RT completion and radiological RP presentation was shorter in patients who progressed to symptomatic RP (P = .001); progression was highly probable if this latency period was <=2 months (P = .002). Stage and RT technique correlated with symptomatic RP development (P = .046 and P = .046, respectively). Among dosimetric factors, a V20 (defined as the lung volume receiving >=20 Gy) of >30% was the most significant predictor of symptomatic RP (P = .001). The NLR and C-reactive protein level at radiological RP were higher in patients who developed symptomatic RP (P = .067 and P = .012, respectively). On multivariate analysis, a V20 >30% and an NLR at radiological RP >6 were associated with symptomatic RP development., CONCLUSION: The NLR at radiological RP is a useful biomarker for predicting symptomatic RP development after CCRT in stage III NSCLC patients.

3657,"Radioiodine therapy in Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters treated with or without carbimazole at the time of radioiodine therapy. We S ought to ascertain how high the success rates of radioiodine therapy are for Graves' disease patients with large diffuse goiters when aiming for a constant absorbed dose of 250 Gy. Thirty-six patients with a thyroid volume of 50-110 mL were evaluated for changes in thyroid function and appearance 3, 6, and 12 months after radioiodine therapy. Success was defined as definitive elimination of hyperthyroidism following therapy (hypothyroidism corrected with thyroxine on diagnosis); failure as persistent/recurrent hyperthyroidism after 12 months. Overall success rate was 50%. However, a subgroup of 20 patients without simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-off) showed a highly significantly larger success rate (85%) than the 16 patients with simultaneous carbimazole (carbimazole-on) at the time of radioiodine therapy (6.3%, p< 0.000005). Successful cases showed a significantly higher volume reduction after radioiodine than failures (75.5% vs. 35.4%, p < 0.00005). Stepwise logistic regression showed that therapy failure was related to administration of carbimazole during radioiodine therapy (p < 0.0250 and absorbed dose (p < 0.05), but not thyroid function (free triiodothyronine [FT3] and free thyroxine [FT4]), initial thyroid volume or thyrotropin-receptor antibody (TRAb) value. However, a significant correlation of therapy success to absorbed dose (r = 0.69, p < 0.005) could be shown only for carbimazole-off patients, but not for the others. Finally, multivariate favor analysis consistently showed that therapy success was correlated only to absorbed dose and antithyroid drugs, not to initial thyroid volume, TRAb value, or thyroid function. Thyroid volume per se is not responsible for the lower success rate in Graves' disease patients with large goiters because even a comparable group of 32 Graves' disease patients with small thyroid glands (<=20 mL) and without simultaneous carbimazole showed a success rate of 87.5%. The high failure rate in the carbimazole-on patients (absorbed dose comparable to carbimazole-off) is due to the simultaneous administration of carbimazole. Therefore, if clinically feasible, we recommend discontinuing carbimazole at least one day before beginning radioiodine therapy.",Excluded

2607,"10-Year Follow-Up After Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography in Patients With Suspected Coronary Artery Disease. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the long-term prognostic power of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to predict cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Background(s): Prognostic usefulness of coronary CTA has been confirmed for short- and intermediate-term follow-up. However, long-term data for prognostic usefulness is still lacking, but is paramount because of the slowly progressing nature of coronary artery disease (CAD). Method(s): A total of 2,011 patients with suspected but not previously diagnosed CAD were examined by coronary CTA. Mean follow-up was 10.0 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 8.1 to 11.2 years). Cox proportional hazards analysis was used for the composite endpoint of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Event-free survival, which was defined as the years it took to reach a cumulative 1% risk for the composite endpoint and reclassification from clinical risk, was calculated. Result(s): The study endpoint was reached in 58 patients (42 cardiac deaths, 16 nonfatal myocardial infarctions). Coronary CTA-assessed CAD severity (normal, nonobstructive, or obstructive) showed the best correlation with the endpoint, with an adjusted c-index of 0.704, compared with a univariate c-index of 0.622 for the clinical risk model (Morise score) alone. The annual event rate for patients with normal coronary arteries on baseline coronary CTA was 0.04%, which translated to an event-free survival period of 10 years. The highest annual event rate of 1.33% was found in patients with 3-vessel obstructive CAD. Reclassification from clinical risk (Morise score) was possible in approximately two-thirds of all patients (68%; p < 0.0001), which led to a substantial reduction of the intermediate-risk group (reduction from 74% to 15%) in favor of the low-risk group (increase from 20% to 83%). Conclusion(s): Patients with normal coronary CTA results benefitted from an event-free survival period of 10 years against cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. Risk stratification according to coronary CTA results allowed for the delineation of clearly diverging prognostic groups and reclassified approximately two-thirds of all patients from clinical risk groups.Copyright © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation",Excluded
290,"Solar urticaria. Introduction. Solar urticaria (SU) is a rare photodermatosis induced by a broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. Theoretically it should not present a diagnostic problem, but in everyday practice it is quite frequently misdiagnosed. Objective. To characterize SU cases diagnosed in the photobiology unit of the Dermatological Department of WUM, with particular analysis of conformity of initial diagnosis with that established in the photobiology unit. Material and methods. Investigation was performed in 87 patients directed to the photobiology unit with diagnosis of solar urticaria (out of 12 041 patients with different forms of light hypersensitivity tested). In all patients in order to determine sensitivity to UVB and UVA phototests were performed. They included evaluation of minimal urticarial dose. As the light source fluorescent bulbs emitting a continuous spectrum of UVB or UVA were used. In 5 patients to evaluate sensitivity to visible light a slide projector was used. In 30 patients additionally photopatch tests were done. Results. Our results confirmed rare occurrence of solar urticaria. Diagnosis of US was confirmed only in 15 out of 87 patients with such initial diagnosis (17.2%); they represented 0.12% of all patients with photodermatoses tested. In this group there were 8 women and 7 men of mean age 26.2 years (M), 25.7 years (W). In the majority (9) of cases the disease lasted one year before testing. The US action spectrum in our patients was UVA + UVB in 9 cases, mainly UVA in 2, mainly UVB in 2, and in two patients urticarial wheals were provoked by UVA, UVB and visible light. We did not notice either delayed onset or prolonged duration of urticaria. Photopatch testing and longer (up to 2 weeks after UV exposure) observation of irradiated sites enabled us to make a proper diagnosis in further 52 patients. In 35 we disclosed polymorphic light eruptions, in 12 contact dermatitis to chromium, in 2 photocontact dermatitis to chlorpromazine and fragrance substances. In 3 patients we diagnosed chronic actinic dermatitis. In 20 cases it was not possible to establish a definite diagnosis. Wrong initial diagnosis was observed mainly in patients hypersensitive to UVA. Conclusions. In patients with oedemato-erythematous lesions after sun exposure lasting longer than 24 h, particularly in the elderly, diagnostic procedures should include additionally to phototesting patch and photopatch tests.",Excluded
2187,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy plus adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A retrospective controlled study. Background: In the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is under-evaluated. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of NAC plus IMRT and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on locoregionally advanced NPC. Method(s): Between January 2004 and December 2008, 240 cases of locoregionally advanced NPC confirmed by pathologic assessment in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 240 patients, 117 received NAC followed by IMRT, and 123 were treated with CCRT plus AC. The NAC + IMRT group received a regimen that included cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The CCRT + AC group received cisplatin concurrently with radiotherapy, and subsequently received adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU. The survival rates were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the survival curves were compared using a log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 78.0, 87.9, 79.0, and 69.8%, respectively, for the NAC + IMRT group and 78.7, 84.8, 76.2, and 65.6%, respectively, for the CCRT + AC group. There were no significant differences in survival between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, age (<50 years vs. >=50 years) and overall stage (III vs. IV) were found to be independent predictors for OS and DFS; furthermore, the overall stage was a significant prognostic factor for DMFS. Compared with the CCRT + AC protocol, the NAC + IMRT protocol significantly reduced the occurrence rates of grade 3-4 nausea-vomiting (6.5 vs. 1.5%, P = 0.023) and leukopenia (9.7 vs. 0.8%, P = 0.006). Conclusion(s): The treatment outcomes of the NAC + IMRT and CCRT + AC groups were similar. Distant metastasis remained the predominant mode of treatment failure.Copyright © 2016 Qiu et al.",Excluded
3519,"Role of routine chest radiography after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. BACKGROUND: The role of routine chest radiography (CXR) after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been questioned., METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study, on a mixed medical/surgical critical care unit in a university teaching hospital. We studied all patients undergoing PDT as part of their critical care management from November 1, 2003 until July 31, 2007. All PDTs were performed under bronchoscopic guidance. After PDT, we reviewed the immediate post-procedural films to assess the utility of routine postoperative CXR. For the purposes of CXR review, we considered a procedure to be either uncomplicated or technically difficult. Clinically relevant CXR findings were new barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum) or a significant change in consolidation from the pre-procedure film., RESULTS: A total of 384 patients underwent PDT during the study period. Of these, 345 had immediate post-procedural CXRs available for review. There were 252 PDTs (73%) documented as uncomplicated. There were 93 (27%) technically difficult procedures, with 107 adverse events recorded. In 82 (24%) procedures, these difficulties were described as minor procedural complications [multiple attempts at needle insertion (> or = 3), minor bleeding or tracheal ring fracture]. Significant complications (mal-placement in the anterior mediastinum and major bleeding) were documented in 12 (3.5%) patients. New abnormalities were noted on 8 (2.3%) immediate post-procedural CXRs. In only one patient was there a new CXR change in an uncomplicated PDT., CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CXR after uncomplicated PDT performed under bronchoscopic guidance rarely reveals unexpected radiological abnormalities. The role of CXR after PDT appears to be restricted to those patients undergoing technically difficult and complicated procedures. A change in practice to this effect will lead to reductions in both medical costs and exposure of staff and patients to ionizing radiation.",Excluded
666,"Vitreoretinal lymphoma: Changing trends in diagnosis and local treatment modalities at a single institution. Introduction: The purpose of this study was to report the changing trends in treatment (external beam radiotherapy [EBRT] and intravitreal chemotherapy) of VRL and treatment outcomes at a single institution. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective chart review of vitreous biopsy proven patients was performed. The data analysis included demographics, systemic lymphoma status, ocular symptoms, clinical and immunocytological findings, treatment methods, and response (intravitreal methotrexate 300 mug/0.05 mL, 1000 mug/0.1 mL of rituximab and EBRT 36-45 Gy) and ocular and systemic lymphoma outcomes at last follow-up. Result(s): Twelve eyes of 8 patients had intraocular B-cell lymphoma (median age, 61 years; range, 50-83). Central nervous system non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (CNS-NHL) was present in 7 of 8 patients. Most common ocular symptoms were diminution of vision in 4 and floaters in 3 patients. Iritis and uveitis were fournd in 6 eyes and vitritis in 11 eyes. Retinal infiltrates were present in 8 eyes. Immunocytology revealed elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-10 (12,783.5 pg/mL), IL-6 (26.7 pg/mL), and IgH gene rearrangement. Three patients were treated with EBRT, 6 eyes with intravitreal methotrexate (median, 9.5; range, 2-15), and 2 eyes with intravitreal rituximab injections (median, 4; range, 2-6). Two patients developed marked keratitis because of methotrexate toxicity. At median follow-up of 33.5 months (range, 4-96), VRL had resolved in 7 eyes and persistent in 5 eyes. One patient died because of advanced CNS-NHL. Conclusion(s): Intravitreal chemotherapy provided good control rates for VRL patients in our limited series. Patients with associated CNS-NHL had poorer outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2432,"Assessment of normal reference values for thyroid uptake of technetium-99m pertechnetate in a single centre UK population. Objective This study aims to explore the normal reference values for thyroid uptake of technetium-99m (99m Tc) pertechnetate in a UK population. Patients and methods A retrospective review of 60 euthyroid patients who underwent thyroid imaging with 99m Tc pertechnetate between January 2012 to April 2014 as part of dual-tracer subtraction parathyroid scintigraphy. 99m Tc pertechnetate thyroid uptake values were determined for each patient. Medical records and biochemical thyroid function tests were reviewed to ensure that all patients were not on medication that could affect thyroid function and they were both clinically and biochemically euthyroid 6 months before and following the scan. Results Median and interquartile uptake range of 99m Tc pertechnetate in euthyroid patients were 0.9 and 0.5-1.4%, respectively. The normal reference range in the study population was 0.2-2.0%. Thyroid uptake inversely correlated with age in females (r=-0.40, P=0.04), males (r=-0.50, P=0.04), and whole group (r=-0.40, P=0.002). Conclusion The calculated normal reference range in this study was found to be less than that used in our own and many other UK institutions. The results demonstrate the importance of periodic evaluation of normal uptake values and provide support for prospective studies defining the normal reference range to be performed.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

1868,"Gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) chemotherapy with sandwiched radiotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL), nasal-type is a rare but highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis. Optimal treatment strategies for newly diagnosed localized ENKL have not been fully defined. Here we retrospectively analyzed 72 patients with newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL treated with gemcitabine, dexamethasone, and cisplatin (GDP) regimen chemotherapy with sandwiched radiotherapy in our department between May 2012 and September 2014. After 2 cycles of GDP induction chemotherapy, the complete response rate (CRR) and overall response rate (ORR) were 30.6% (22/72) and 91.7% (66/72). After whole treatment completion, the CRR and ORR were 81.9% (59/72) and 91.7% (66/72), respectively. With a median follow-up of 57.8 months (Interquartile Range 54.0-64.5 months), the 5-year progression-free survival rate was 70.9% (95% CI, 60.1% to 81.7%), and the 5-year overall survival rate was 72.0% (95% CI, 61.6% to 82.4%), respectively. Patients with CRR after treatment had better prognosis than their counterparts. The major adverse events were myelosuppression, liver dysfunction, gemcitabine-related skin rash, and digestive tract toxicities. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were 18.0% (13/72) and 15.3% (11/72), respectively. No treatment related deaths were observed. It is concluded that the GDP regimen with sandwiched radiotherapy was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for newly diagnosed stage IE/IIE ENKL, nasal-type.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

3621,"Stability and survival of bone-anchored hearing aid implant systems in post-irradiated patients. Bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) are based on the principle of osseointegration, which is fundamental to implant stability and survival. Previous exposure to ionising radiation may compromise this, as evidenced in relation to dental and craniofacial implants. There is a dearth of data, however, regarding BAHA implant systems in patients with previously irradiated implant sites. We sought, therefore, to investigate implant stability and survival in such patients. Patients were identified retrospectively from our electronic BAHA database. Hospital records were reviewed for demographics; operative technique; complications; and details regarding previous irradiation. Implant stability was assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA), generating a numerical value-implant stability quotient (ISQ). Extrapolating from dental studies, successfully loaded implants typically have ISQs of >=60. Readings were, therefore, interpreted with respect to this. Seven patients were identified for inclusion. Mean time between irradiation and implant insertion was 33 months (range 16-72 months), and mean time from implant insertion to RFA measurement was 41 months (range 3-96 months). Operatively, all patients underwent single-stage procedures under local anaesthesia. One patient suffered a Holger's grade 2 skin reaction, while two suffered significant skin flap failure, requiring revision procedures. The implant survival rate was 100 %. All ISQ values were >60, with a mean of 66.9 (95 % confidence interval 63.1-70.6). Our data support sufficient osseointegration of BAHA implant systems in post-irradiated patients, but highlight issues with wound healing. Contemporary soft tissue preservation operative techniques will likely overcome this, facilitating safe and efficacious BAHA insertion in this ever-increasing group of patients.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
1635,"Occupational cancer in central European countries. The countries of central Europe, including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, suffer from environmental and occupational health problems created during the political system in place until the late 1980s. This situation is reflected by data on workplace exposure to hazardous agents. Such data have been systematically collected in Skovakia and the Czech Republic since 1977. The data presented describe mainly the situation in the early 1990s. The number of workers exposed to risk factors at the workplace represent about 10% of the working population in Slovakia and 30% in Poland. In Slovakia in 1992 the percentage of persons exposed to chemical substances was 16.4%, to ionizing radiation 4.3%, and to carcinogens 3.3% of all workers exposed to risk factors. The total number of persons exposed to substances proven to be carcinogens in Poland was 1.3% of the employees; 2.2% were exposed to the suspected carcinogens. The incidence of all certified occupational diseases in the Slovak Republic was 53 per 100,000 insured employees in 1992. Cancers certified as occupational cancers are skin cancer caused by occupational exposure to carcinogens, lung cancer caused by ionizing radiation, and asbestosis together with lung cancer. Specific information on occupational cancers from Romania and Bulgaria was not available for this paper. It is difficult to predict a trend for future incidences of occupational cancer. Improved control technology, governmental regulatory activity to reduce exposure, surveillance of diseases and risk factors, and vigilant use of preventive measures should, however, ultimately reduce occupational cancer.",Excluded
2934,"Benefits for bone from resistance exercise and nutrition in long-duration spaceflight: Evidence from biochemistry and densitometry. Exercise has shown little success in mitigating bone loss from long-duration spaceflight. The first crews of the International Space Station (ISS) used the ""interim resistive exercise device"" (iRED), which allowed loads of up to 297 lb(f) (or 1337 N) but provided little protection of bone or no greater protection than aerobic exercise. In 2008, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which allowed absolute loads of up to 600 lb(f) (1675 N), was launched to the ISS. We report dietary intake, bone densitometry, and biochemical markers in 13 crewmembers on ISS missions from 2006 to 2009. Of these 13, 8 had access to the iRED and 5 had access to the ARED. In both groups, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase tended to increase during flight toward the end of the mission (p = 0.06) and increased 30 days after landing (p < 0.001). Most markers of bone resorption were also increased in both groups during flight and 30 days after landing (p < 0.05). Bone densitometry revealed significant interactions (time and exercise device) for pelvis bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (p < 0.01), hip femoral neck BMD (p < 0.05), trochanter BMD (p < 0.05), and total hip BMD (p < 0.05). These variables were unchanged from preflight only for ARED crewmembers, who also returned from flight with higher percent lean mass and lower percent fat mass. Body mass was unchanged after flight in both groups. All crewmembers had nominal vitamin D status (75 +/- 17 nmol/L) before and during flight. These data document that resistance exercise, coupled with adequate energy intake (shown by maintenance of body mass determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and vitamin D, can maintain bone in most regions during 4- to 6-month missions in microgravity. This is the first evidence that improving nutrition and resistance exercise during spaceflight can attenuate the expected BMD deficits previously observed after prolonged missions.

3631,"Lung cancer in never smokers. Lung cancer is predominantly associated with cigarette smoking; however, a substantial minority of patients with the disease have never smoked. In the US it is estimated there are 17,000-26,000 annual deaths from lung cancer innever smokers, which as a separate entity would be the seventh leading cause of cancer mortality. Controversy surrounds the question of whether or not the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is increasing, with more data to support this observation in Asia. There are several factors associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer in never smokers including second hand smoke, indoor air pollution, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility among others. Adenocarcinoma is the most common histology of lung cancer in never smokers and in comparison to lung cancer in smokers appears less complex with a higher likelihood to have targetable driver mutations.Copyright © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Excluded
1182,"The prostate cancer risk locus at 10q11 is associated with DNA repair capacity. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mildly predict prostate cancer risk. These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (. p=. 0.0003) and also a decreased MD index (. p=. 0.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, . MSMB (microseminoprotein beta) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994. Based on the present observation, candidate genes from the contexts of DNA repair and apoptosis may be more promising targets for expression studies with respect to the rs10993994 genotype. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Purpose: To obtain estimates of human normal-organ radiation doses of 18F-SKI-249380, as a prerequisite step towards first-in-human trial. 18F-SKI-249380 is a first-of-its-kind PET tracer for imaging the in vivo pharmacokinetics of dasatinib, an investigational targeted therapy for solid malignancies. Procedures: Isoflurane-anesthetized mice received tracer dose via tail vein. Organ time-integrated activity coefficients, fractional urinary and hepatobiliary excretion, and total-body clearance kinetics were derived from PET data, with allometric extrapolation to the Standard Man anatomic model and normal-organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. Result(s): The human effective dose was 0.031 mSv/MBq. The critical organ was the upper large intestine, with a dose equivalent of 0.25 mSv/MBq. A 190-MBq administered activity of 18F-SKI-249380 is thus predicted to expose an adult human to radiation doses generally comparable to those of routinely used diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.

1232,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation. Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded
1908,"Horizontal angular VOR, nystagmus dumping, and sensation duration in spacelab SLS-1 crewmembers. In 1G, the apparent time constant (Td) of postrotatory SPV decay with the head tilted face down is 55% of that with head erect (Te). This phenomenon is called ""nystagmus dumping"" and has been attributed to G effects on VOR velocity storage. Similarly, postrotatory sensation duration with head tilted (Dd) is 32% of that when head erect (De). In parabolic flight, Te and De are 70% of 1-G values, but a pitch back dumping movement produces no further change. Te, Td, and Dd have not previously been measured in orbital flight. VOR and sensation duration was tested in 4 crewmembers in 4 preflight, 1 inflight (days 4 or 5) and 4 post flight sessions. Bitemporal EOG was recorded with eyes open in darkness. Instructions were to ""gaze straight ahead,"" and indicate when ""rotation sensation disappears or becomes ambiguous"". Subjects were rotated CW and CCW head erect for 1 min at 120 degrees/s, stopped, and EOG was recorded for another 1 min. This procedure was then used to study dumping, except that immediately after chair stop, subjects pitched their head forward 90 degrees. SPV was calculated using order statistic filtering, and dropouts removed using an iterative model fitting method. Te and Td were determined by logarithmic linear regression of mean SPV for each subject. In orbit, 90 degrees pitch movement produced rapid subjective dumping, but not nystagmus dumping. Dd was noticeably shorter (""almost instantaneous"") compared to preflight Dd. Te and Td in orbit were similar to preflight Te for 3/4 subjects (rather than to preflight Td as expected). No consistent VOR gain changes were seen in orbit. Although Te is known to decrease acutely in parabolic flight, a longer time constant was measured in 3/4 subjects after 4-5 days adaptation to weightlessness, suggesting a return of angular velocity storage.",Excluded

1676,"A minimally invasive assay for individual assessment of the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity. Ionizing radiation induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) which activate the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through transcription of genes including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This pathway prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis as demonstrated in heritable syndromes (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT); Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Here, a simple assay based on gene expression in peripheral blood to measure accurately ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity is described. The expression of p21, Puma and Sesn2 was determined in blood from mice with different gene copy numbers of Atm, Trp53 (p53), Chek2 or Arf and in human blood and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocyte (MSTL) cultures from AT, AT carriers, LFS patients and controls, both before and after ex vivo ionizing irradiation. Mouse Atm/Chek2/p53 activity was highly dependent on the copy number of each gene except Arf. In human MSTL, an AT case, AT carriers and LFS patients showed responses distinct from healthy donors. The relationship between gene copy number and transcriptional induction upon radiation was linear for p21 and Puma and correlated well with cancer incidence in p53 variant mice. This reliable blood test provides an assay to determine ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity and demonstrates the feasibility of assessing the activity of this essential cancer protection pathway in simple assays. These findings may have implications for the individualized prediction of cancer susceptibility. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
1434,"Surgical management of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Introduction: The surgical procedure by the anterior, posterior and combined antero-posterior approaches had applied for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Method(s): During the treatment process, all patients were pre-operatively as well post-operatively graded according to Japanese Orthopaedics Association. Several surgical methods such as anterior approach, posterior approach, and combined antero-posterior approach have been addressed for CSM patients, with the choice based on the pathogenesis of the myelopathy. The main indications for surgery were evidence of myelopathy on physical examinations, a JOA score below 13 points help with spinal cord compression observed on plain X-ray, CT scan, MRI studies. Result(s): The pre-operative JOA scores were 7.60+/-1.23 in laminoplasty, 8.30+/-1.03 in diskectomy and corpectomy and 7.10+/-1.20 in combined antero-posterior approach patients. At the follow-up after three months the JOA scores were laminoplasty 13.30+/-1.30, diskectomy and corpectomy 13.55+/-1.15 and combined antero-posterior 13.50+/-1.08. The JOA recovery rate averaged, 61.08+/-11.25% in laminoplasty, 60.67+/-10.60% in diskectomy and corpectomy and 64.67+/-10.72% in combined anteroposterior approach. The high- signal intensity changed to normal in 18 out of 28 and no any kyphotic change and instability were found in cervical spine at the follow up. Conclusion(s): Patients with OPLL (continuous, segmental and mixed type), stenosis of cervical spinal canal, multilevel cervical spondylosis, large and high ossification of IVDP with stenosis were improved with laminoplasty. Patients with PIVD, CSM with kyphosis, post laminectomy, OPLL herniated type, unstable vertebral alignment, stenosis by osteophytes, were improved with anterior approach. Ossified or deformed OPLL, unstable vertebral with stenosis,OPLL or OYL with cervical meandearing (swan-neck) were improved with Combined anterior and posterior approach.",Excluded
2907,"[Possibilities of prognostication of individual radiation sensitivity]. Proceeding from the concept of individual radiosensitivity as a sign of total reactivity 3 directions in a study of its possible prediction were considered: establishing correlation between separate indices characterizing the initial state and total radiosensitivity; correlation between body reactions to non-radiation exposures and subsequent irradiation; comparison of total radiosensitivity to irradiation at a small dose and subsequent irradiation at LD50. The following indices were used for the evaluation of the basal status of the body: oxygen consumption level, body mass increase rate, the level of water and basal metabolism, peripheral blood indices, body temperature, basal indices of the functional adrenocortical activity, the state of the cardiovascular system. The following non-radiation stress-exposures were used: physical exercise, constant magnetic field, starvation, hypoxia, and adrenaline administration. A V-type dependency was established for most investigated indices of the basal status and reaction of the body to non-radiation exposures. The utmost radioresistance was shown by animals in whom the basal indices or their reaction to non-radiation exposure approximated the average group level. The third direction: comparison of radiosensitivity and radiation damage--was analyzed by comparing the reaction of cerebral biocurrents to radiation exposure at a small dose with subsequent damage of the body following irradiation at a lethal dose. The accuracy of predicting the outcome of radiation injury by some of the indices varied from 65 to 80%. In some indices of the basal status and reactivity evaluation it reached 85-90%.",Excluded
2288,"The origin of Europeans is not rooted in the Middle East but in Southern East Asia. The study of tooth crown variables has proven useful in the assessment of human origin and dispersal. I show that multivariate analysis of quantified total tooth structure from dental X-rays is a powerful phylogenetic methodology. From an analysis of the complex global dental phenotype ('GDP,' composed of ~ 30 root, pulp, crown, and enamel variables per tooth), a representative Western European population was found to associate with Southeast Asians, while Mongolians formed a tight cluster with all Native Americans. The results suggest that either an emigrant wave, or waves, of modern humans emerged from Africa and with time segregated into at least three groups: Australian aborigines, Europeans, and Southeast Asians, or less likely due to genetic and archaeologic observations, a southern Asia origin of all modem humans from an emigrant African hominid. Both hypotheses portend an early evolution of the European genotype and support the argument that Europeans are principally derived from Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and thus Middle East Neolithic people did not have a major genetic impact on Europeans.",Excluded
2340,"Antegrade wire escalation for chronic total occlusions in coronary arteries: Simple algorithms as a key to success. Aims: Antegrade wire escalation (AWE) remains the method of choice for tackling chronic total occlusions (CTOs), especially for lesions with low J-CTO score. To increase the number of operators which treat CTOs and increase AWE success rates, there is a need for a clear, algorithmic approach. We report the results of a simple AWE algorithm with new guidewire technology in coronary CTOs. Method(s): Hundred consecutive CTO lesions selected for AWE as the primary strategy were included in five Benelux centers. The algorithm follows a step-wise increase in guidewire tip load. Lesions were categorized according to the J-CTO score. Primary endpoint was successful guidewire crossing. Result(s): No differences in baseline demographics were present between successful and unsuccessful procedures. Overall, in 75% of the lesions AWE resulted in successful crossing. AWE success rates in easy, intermediate, difficult and very difficult CTOs were 83, 86, 71 and 43%, respectively. 46% could be crossed using a soft guidewire only. An additional success of 34 and 60% could be reached with an intermediate and stiff guidewire, respectively. Adding additional techniques resulted in 88% overall success. Procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses and use of contrast were within highly acceptable ranges (67+/-39min, 27+/-19min, 1.7+/-1.3 Gy, 264+/-123ml). Conclusion(s): The algorithm and new wire technologies led to high success rates. AWE as a standalone procedure is highly successful in J-CTO 0-1. Low- and intermediatevolume CTO operators should try to implement a systematic approach in their CTO procedures, especially for lesions with low J-CTO scores. Adding additional techniques further increases these success rates.© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1024,"Feasibility of an adaptive strategy in preoperative radiochemotherapy for rectal cancer with image-guided tomotherapy: Boosting the dose to the shrinking tumor. Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of preoperative adaptive radiochemotherapy by delivering a concomitant boost to the residual tumor during the last 6 fractions of treatment. Methods and Materials: Twenty-five patients with T3/T4N0 or N+ rectal cancer were enrolled. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on days -14, 0, and +14, and 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2/d from day -14 to the end of radiation therapy (day 0 is the start of radiation therapy). Radiation therapy consisted of 41.4 Gy in 18 fractions (2.3 Gy per fraction) with Tomotherapy to the tumor and regional lymph nodes (planning target volume, PTV) defined on simulation CT and MRI. After 9 fractions simulation CT and MRI were repeated for the planning of the adaptive phase: PTVadapt was generated by adding a 5-mm margin to the residual tumor. In the last 6 fractions a boost of 3.0 Gy per fraction (in total 45.6 Gy in 18 fractions) was delivered to PTVadapt while concomitantly delivering 2.3 Gy per fraction to PTV outside PTVadapt. Result(s): Three patients experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity; 2 of 3 showed toxicity before the adaptive phase. Full dose of radiation therapy, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil was delivered in 96%, 96%, and 88% of patients, respectively. Two patients with clinical complete response (cCR) refused surgery and were still cCR at 17 and 29 months. For the remaining 23 resected patients, 15 of 23 (65%) showed tumor regression grade 3 response, and 7 of 23 (30%) had pathologic complete response; 8 (35%) and 12 (52%) tumor regression grade 3 patients had <=5% and 10% residual viable cells, respectively. Conclusion(s): An adaptive boost strategy is feasible, with an acceptable grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity rate and a very encouraging tumor response rate. The results suggest that there should still be room for further dose escalation of the residual tumor with the aim of increasing pathologic complete response and/or cCR rates. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1691,"Dual-layer spectral computed tomography: Virtual non-contrast in comparison to true non-contrast images. Purpose: To evaluate virtual-non-contrast (VNC) images obtained from clinical triphasic scans with a dual-layer spectral computed tomography system regarding accuracy of iodine subtraction. Material(s) and Method(s): From September to December 2016, 62 consecutive patients who underwent a clinical routine triphasic CT examination were included into this retrospective study. VNC images based on the arterial and portal venous phase were generated. For every patient and every contrast phase, a region-of-interest (ROI) was defined in aorta, liver, renal cortex, spongious bone, fat, muscle and fluid (i.e. gallbladder, urinary bladder), resulting in 2170 ROIs. VNC images were compared to true-non-contrast (TNC) images regarding difference in attenuation. Consistency between VNC images obtained from the arterial and portal venous phase as well as the influence of the initial attenuation on respective VNC images were evaluated. Result(s): Comparison of HU in VNC and TNC images showed a high accuracy of iodine elimination. Mean difference between TNC and VNC images was only 0.5 +/- 8.5 HU and >90% of all comparisons showed a difference of less than 15 HU. For all tissues but spongious bone, mean absolute difference between TNC and VNC images was below 10 HU. VNC images derived from the arterial and the portal venous phase showed excellent correlation. The quality of iodine removal in VNC images was not influenced by the original contrast enhancement. However, VNC images cannot be used for evaluation of iodine removal in bone as bone and iodine can hardly be differentiated via spectral CT. Conclusion(s): VNC imaging in DL-CT is a promising tool for daily clinical routine. As non-enhanced CT images are essential in multiple clinical situations, the permanent availability of VNC images with dual-layer spectral CT will result in a substantial reduction of radiation exposure and an increased diagnostic value of monophasic contrast-enhanced CT scans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
649,"An exploratory study of the relation of population density and agricultural activity to hematologic malignancies in North Dakota. Introduction: Established risk factors for hematologic cancers include exposure to ionizing radiation, organic solvents, and genetic mutation; however, the potential roles of environmental and sociological factors are not well explored. As North Dakota engages in significant agricultural activity, the present investigation seeks to determine whether an association exists between the incidence of hematologic cancers and either population density or agricultural occupation for residents of south central North Dakota. Method(s): The present study is a retrospective analysis. Cases of hematologic malignancies and associated pre-malignant conditions were collected from the regional Central North Dakota Cancer Registry, and analysis of study-specific demographic factors was performed. Result(s): Significantly higher incidence of hematologic cancers and pre-malignant disorders was associated with residence in an ""urban"" county and rural city/town. Within the latter designation, there was a higher rate of self-reported agricultural occupation (40% vs 10%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): The increased incidence of hematologic cancer in low population density areas of south central North Dakota supports the need for more detailed prospective research centered on agricultural exposures.",Excluded
449,"Differentiation between recurrent gliomas and radiation necrosis using arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging has been proposed as an effective method to measure brain tumor perfusion. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of this technique in the differentiation of recurrent gliomas from radiation necrosis. Twenty-one patients with surgically treated primary gliomas, including 16 cases of recurrent glioma and 5 of radiation necrosis were examined using 3.0T MR imaging (MRI). ASL and dynamic susceptibility contrast-weighted (DSC) perfusion MRI scans were performed. Maps of normalized cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ASL imaging and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in DSC imaging were computed and analyzed in the regions of interest. In cases of glioma recurrence, the normalized ASL-CBF ratio (4.45+/-2.72) was higher than that in cases of radiation injury (1.22+/-0.61) (P<0.01). The normalized DSC-relative CBV ratio was also significantly higher in glioma recurrence (3.38+/-2.08) than it was in radiation injury (1.09+/-0.55) (P<0.05). A close linear correlation was found between the ASL and DSC MRI techniques (linear regression coefficient, R=0.85; P=0.005) in the differentiation of recurrent glioma from radiation injury. The results indicate that ASL perfusion is an accurate method of distinguishing between glioma recurrence and radiation necrosis.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

1073,"In vitro activation of the in vivo colony-forming units of the mouse yolk sac. Experiments were performed to investigate the presence of colony-forming units (CFU) in the mouse embryonic yolk sac during the developmental period in which the yolk sac is the sole hemopoietic organ. Injection of yolk sac cell suspensions from normal embryos into syngeneic, lethally irradiated adult recipients evoked a very low number of spleen colonies. However, prior cultivation of yolk sacs in vitro caused a dramatic increase in the spleen colony-forming capacity--as high as 84-fold--following 48 hours in culture. The yolk sac origin of the spleen colonies was confirmed by: (a) Chromosomal marker analysis; (b) dose-response analysis; (c) demonstrating that the above colonies were not of endogenous origin induced by the mere injection of grafted cells. We conclude that the yolk sac contains many precursors of colony-forming cells which though undetectable by immediate grafting apparently become activated in culture by an as yet unknown induction process.",Excluded
2388,"Minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy. We reported here the data on minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) in a large group of 253 patients enrolled from the whole series of 355 consecutive patients affected by primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) referred to our center. On the basis of preoperative imaging including Sestamibi scintigraphy and neck ultrasound (US), 263 patients (74% of the whole series) with evidence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) and a normal thyroid gland were addressed to MIRP and in 253 (96%) of them this minimally invasive neck exploration was successfully performed. The MIRP protocol developed in our center consisted of a very low 1 mCi Sestamibi injection in the operating room a few minutes before the start of intervention, thus minimizing the radiation exposure dose to the patient and personnel. No major intraoperative complication was recorded in patients treated by MIRP and only a transient hypocalcemia in 8.5% of cases. The mean duration time for MIRP was 35 min and the mean hospital stay 1.2 days. Local anesthesia was also performed in 62 patients, 54 of whom were elderly patients with concomitant invalidating diseases contraindicating general anesthesia. No HPT relapse was observed during subsequent follow-up. The gamma probe was used also during bilateral neck exploration in the group of 92 patients excluded from MIRP. The most frequent cause of exclusion from MIRP in our series was the presence of concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules (68.5% of cases) that can give false positive results at radioguided surgery. In conclusion, MIRP is an effective treatment in patients with a high likelihood of a solitary PA and a normal thyroid gland at scintigraphy and US so that an accurate preoperative localizing imaging is required for MIRP. A low 1 mCi Sestamibi dose appears sufficient to perform MIRP. Patients with concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules should be excluded from MIRP. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

3693,"Growing incidence of thyroid carcinoma in recent years: Factors underlying overdiagnosis. There is an increasing incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer worldwide. Much of the increase is secondary to increased detection of small, low-risk tumors, with questionable clinical significance. This review addresses the factors that contribute to the increasing incidence and considers environmental, and patient-based and clinician-led influences. Articles addressing the causes of the increased incidence were critically reviewed. A complex interplay of environmental, medical, and social pressures has resulted in increased awareness of the thyroid disease risk, increased screening of thyroid cancers, and increased diagnosis of thyroid cancers. Although there is evidence to suggest that the true disease incidence may be changing slightly, most of the increase is related to factors that promote early diagnosis of low-risk lesions, which is resulting in a significant phenomenon of overdiagnosis. An improved understanding of these pressures at a global level will enable healthcare policymakers to react appropriately to this challenge in the future.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
1178,"Use of radiomics combined with machine learning method in the recurrence patterns after intensity-modulated radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A preliminary study. Objective: To analyze the recurrence patterns and reasons in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and to investigate the feasibility of radiomics for analysis of radioresistance. Method(s): We analyzed 306 NPC patients treated with IMRT from Jul-2009 to Aug-2016, 20 of whom developed with recurrence. For the NPCs with recurrence, CT, MR, or PET/CT images of recurrent disease were registered with the primary planning CT for dosimetry analysis. The recurrences were defined as in-field, marginal or out-of-field, according to dose-volume histogram (DVH) of the recurrence volume. To explore the predictive power of radiomics for NPCs with in-field recurrences (NPC-IFR), 16 NPCs with non-progression disease (NPC-NPD) were used for comparison. For these NPC-IFRs and NPC-NPDs, 1117 radiomic features were quantified from the tumor region using pretreatment spectral attenuated inversion-recovery T2-weighted (SPAIR T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated to identify influential feature subset. Kruskal-Wallis test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were employed to assess the capability of each feature on NPC-IFR prediction. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for feature reduction. Artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and validated by using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Result(s): The median follow up was 26.5 (range 8-65) months. 9/20 (45%) occurred in the primary tumor, 8/20 (40%) occurred in regional lymph nodes, and 3/20 (15%) patients developed a primary and regional failure. Dosimetric and target volume analysis of the recurrence indicated that there were 18 in-field, and 1 marginal as well as 1 out-of-field recurrence. With pre-therapeutic SPAIR T2W MRI images available, 11 NPC-IFRs (11 of 18 NPC-IFRs who had available pre-therapeutic MRI) and 16 NPC-NPDs were subsequently employed for radiomic analysis. Results showed that NPC-IFRs vs. NPC-NPDs could be differentiated by 8 features (AUCs: 0.727-0.835). The classification models showed potential in prediction of NPC-IFR with higher accuracies (ANN: 0.812, KNN: 0.775, SVM: 0.732). Conclusion(s): In-field and high-dose region relapse were the main recurrence patterns which may be due to the radioresistance. After integration in the clinical workflow, radiomic analysis can be served as imaging biomarkers to facilitate early salvage for NPC patients who are at risk of in-field recurrence.Copyright © 2018 Li, Wang, Hou, Yang, Ren, Gao, Meng, Wu, Liu, Liu and Yan.

Purpose: We report our experience of intensity-modulated proton and carbon-ion radiotherapy (IMPT/IMCT) for head and neck sarcomas (HNS). Methods and Materials: An analysis of the ongoing prospective data registry from the Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center (SPHIC) for patients with HNS was conducted. The 12- and 24-month rates of local recurrence-free, overall, distant metastasis-free, progression-free survival (LRFS, OS, DMFS, and PFS), and acute/late toxicities were calculated. The prognostic factors for the effectiveness of the treatment were also analyzed. Result(s): Between 7/2014 and 5/2018, 51 consecutive patients with HNS received definitive doses of IMCT (41 cases), IMPT (two cases), or their combination (eight cases). One patient had R0 resection and another treated on the Chinese Food and Drug Administration registration trial received IMPT only. Twenty-seven patients were treated according to various dose escalation trials or institutional protocols using IMCT or IMPT + IMCT boost. Twenty-two patients with locoregional recurrence (10 and four patients failed surgery or surgery followed by radiotherapy, respectively) or radiation-induced second primary sarcomas (eight patients) received salvage particle radiotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 15.7 months, four patients with second primary sarcoma died. The 1- and 2-year OS, PFS, LRFS, and DMFS rates for the entire cohort were 92.9% vs 90%, 73.6% vs 57.4%, 88.4% vs 78.9%, and 84.6% vs 76.5%, respectively. Those rates for patients without prior radiotherapy were 100% vs 100%, 82.1% vs 65.8%, 93.6% vs 85.3%, and 88.4% vs 79.5%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that re-irradiation was an independent prognostic factor for both LRFS and PFS (P = 0.015 and 0.037, respectively). In addition, gross tumor volume (GTV) was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.048). One patient experienced Grade 3 acute toxicity (oral mucositis); another experienced Grade 4 acute event (hemorrhage) which required embolization. He lately died from hemorrhage (Grade 5) at 3.4 months after the completion of treatment. No patient experienced radiation-induced acute/late toxicity of >= Grade 2 otherwise. Conclusion(s): With few observed acute/late toxicities, IMPT/IMCT provided effective short-term tumor control in our patients with HNS.

Aim: The presentation of our results using the Dornier lithotripter (Doli) S electromagnetic shockwave emitter (EMSE) 220 F-XP for the strategic management of staghorn renal calculi. Method(s): Sixteen patients with renal staghorn stones of more than 35 mm in maximum length on plain X-rays were treated by shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy with the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP. Double-J ureteral stent was inserted to all prior to the first SWL treatment. Shock wave counts varied from 2,500 to 3,600 with a shock release frequency of 70-80 pulses per minute. The number of sessions varied from 2 to 6. The interval between the SWL sessions was around 1 month. Fragmentation rate of 20-25% of the stone load per session was considered a valid criterion for progressing to further SWL sessions. Result(s): Nine patients became stone free at the end of SWL sessions and two patients had renal stone fragments smaller than 4 mm, which were eliminated 6 months later. Two patients developed streinstrasse that was managed with ureteroscopy. Auxiliary SWL was also performed on three patients with residual ureteral calculi. The mean follow up period was 12 months. The remaining five patients underwent open surgery for incomplete stone fragmentation. No major complications developed during the follow up period. The predominant composition of stones available for analysis was struvite.

Results 36 patients were evaluable; 21 patients with comorbid conditions were unsuitable for surgery (group 1), 8 had unresectable disease (group 2), and 7 refused surgery (group 3). The clinical complete response (cCR) rate for the 36 evaluable patients was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19%-53%) and the overall response rate was 83% (95% CI, 75%-97%). The median survival time and estimated 2-year survival rate were 25.8 months (95% CI, 7.1-44.5 months) and 52% (95% CI, 38%-67%), respectively.

18,"Comparing different analysis methods for quantifying the MRI amide proton transfer (APT) effect in hyperacute stroke patients. Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a pH mapping method based on the chemical exchange saturation transfer phenomenon that has potential for penumbra identification following stroke. The majority of the literature thus far has focused on generating pH-weighted contrast using magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis instead of quantitative pH mapping. In this study, the widely used asymmetry analysis and a model-based analysis were both assessed on APT data collected from healthy subjects (n = 2) and hyperacute stroke patients (n = 6, median imaging time after onset = 2 hours 59 minutes). It was found that the model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect with the lowest variation in grey and white matter (<= 13.8 %) and the smallest average contrast between these two tissue types (3.48 %) in the healthy volunteers. The model-based approach also performed quantitatively better than the other measures in the hyperacute stroke patient APT data, where the quantified APT effect in the infarct core was consistently lower than in the contralateral normal appearing tissue for all the patients recruited, with the group average of the quantified APT effect being 1.5 +/- 0.3 % (infarct core) and 1.9 +/- 0.4 % (contralateral). Based on the fitted parameters from the model-based analysis and a previously published pH and amide proton exchange rate relationship, quantitative pH maps for hyperacute stroke patients were generated, for the first time, using APT imaging.

3212,"Capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces: A cross-sectional survey. Background Establishment of a hierarchical medical system is one of the major tasks outlined in China's ambitious health reform, and the ultimate success of this system depends on the treatment capacity of primary hospitals. Among the priorities of primary hospitals is the provision of quality services for chronic diseases, including diabetes, atypical and epidemic chronic disease in China. We aimed to estimate the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment in six Chinese provinces. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in China using qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we interviewed 24 related experts (five primary hospital principals, six general practitioner, five drug experts, five medical device experts, two clinical experts, and one health system expert) to establish the capacity standard of primary hospital for diabetes treatment in the hierarchical medical system. Next, we surveyed the treatment capacity with regards to human resources, drug supply, and medical equipment in 28 primary hospitals (17 urban and 11 rural) in six provinces in China (Shanghai, Fujian, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and Guizhou) between May 20 and July 12, 2016. Finally, we compared the survey results against the standard. We adopted purposive sampling, and used chi2 test and rank sum test for data analyses. Ethics approval was granted by Sichuan University, and all participants provided oral informed consent. Findings The primary hospitals surveyed had a mean of 1.76 general practitioners (SD 2.03) per million residents. The mean number of general practitioners per million residents was 1.48 (1.18) for rural hospitals and 1.92 (2.41) for urban hospitals, which were lower than the standard (2-3, based on the expert interviews and policy review). 11 (65%) urban primary hospitals provided three or more types of drugs, compared with four (36%) rural primary hospitals. Urban primary hospitals had a mean of 8.35 (SD 4.44) types of diabetes drugs and rural ones had 4.45 (3.33), although expert interviews and policy reviews indicated that primary hospitals need provide seven types of drugs that are often used in the clinic. 27 (96%) primary hospitals provided metformin, 26 (93%) sulfonylureas, 18 (64%) alphaglucosidase inhibitors, 16 (57%) insulin, 15 (54%) hypoglycaemic proprietary Chinese medicine, 11 (39%) glinides, and nine (32%) thiazolidinediones; newer antidiabetic drugs such as DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, and GLP-1 receptor agonists were scarcely supplied. All 28 primary hospitals were equipped with blood glucose meters, blood pressure instruments, and electrocardiograph machines; 25 (89%) had biochemical analysers, 27 (96%) B ultrasound machines, 20 (71%) colour Doppler ultrasound machines and x-ray machines, and eight (29%) fundus mirrors, while expert interviews showed that primary hospitals should have with all of these equipment. No significant difference in availability of medical equipment was recorded between rural and urban primary hospitals (p>0.05). Interpretation Primary hospitals in China, especially those in rural areas, do not have sufficient human resources and drugs for diabetes treatment, although they generally have adequate medical equipment. Strategies to enhance the capacity of primary hospitals for diabetes treatment need to increase the number of health-care workers and drug supply.",Excluded

BACKGROUND: Both cigarette smoke and ultraviolet (UV) radiation are known to cause changes of the skin which can be regarded as premature ageing., OBJECTIVES: To assess the theory that the effects of these two exposures could be linked by a phototoxic action of cigarette smoke., METHODS: A photohaemolysis test was used, in which human erythrocytes were incubated with cigarette smoke condensate, followed by UV irradiation and measurement of exposure-dependent haemolysis., RESULTS: Cigarette smoke condensate was clearly phototoxic. Photohaemolysis depended on the concentration of the condensate and UV dose and was more pronounced after exposure to UVA-rich than UVB-rich radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Phototoxicity may be a mechanism by which cigarette smoking causes premature skin ageing. An enhancing effect on photocarcinogenesis has also to be considered.",Excluded

Background: CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies showed that ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320. nm) might induce the exacerbation of SLE by decreasing the DNA methylation level. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the UVB-induced CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation remains unclear. Objective(s): To elucidate the role of DNMT1 in lupus CD4+ T cells global DNA hypomethylation enhanced by UVB. Method(s): 35 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and healthy controls exposed to different dosages of UVB were analyzed. The global DNA methylation measurement, real-time PCR, Western blotting and DNMT1 catalytic activity detection were employed. Result(s): The level of global DNA methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients were significantly lower than those from the control group. DNA methylation was decreased after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner in SLE patients, but not in the control group. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression level were not affected by UVB exposure in both SLE patients and healthy controls. DNMT1 catalytic activity was significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner. DNMT1 catalytic activity was lower and more sensitive to UVB exposure in CD4+ T cells from active SLE patients that from stable ones. Conclusion(s): UVB enhanced DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in SLE via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity in a dosage-dependent manner. © 2013 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.",Excluded
3074,"Determining the burden of tuberculosis in Eritrea: A new approach. Objective: To obtain an estimate of the prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in Eritrea using a new low-cost approach. Method(s): The study was designed to include a sample of 35 000 people divided between 40 clusters. The clusters were selected by sampling proportional to population size. In each cluster, census data were obtained from eligible individuals. Individuals aged 15 years or more were questioned about cough and its duration and smoking and were asked to provide two samples of sputum (spot and morning) for examination by fluorescence microscopy. Finding(s): A total of 38 032 individuals were included in the study. Of the 19 197 individuals aged 15 years or more, 18 152 (94.6%) provided at least one sample of sputum. Fifteen individuals fulfilled the case definition, providing a prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis of 90 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, CI, 35-145 per 100 000) individuals aged 15 years or more and 50 per 100 000 (95% CI, 19-80 per 100 000) in the total population. Conclusion(s): The estimated prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis obtained from our study is considerably lower than the estimate published by the World Health Organization. The new methodology for surveys to determine the prevalence of tuberculosis that we used is feasible in the field. This methodology should be validated in other countries and compared with other methods for measuring prevalence.",Excluded
1939,"What is new in the clinic of emphysematous pyelonephritis?. INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, fortunately rare, potentially fatal necrotizing pyelonephritis with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from side pain to septic shock. The majority of cases occur in diabetics with poor glycemic control, while a small percentage may be due to urinary tract obstruction. The disease shows a high mortality rate (19-43%). Escherichia coli is the main causative agent (80%). Diagnosis of EPN should be supported by radiologically. In X Ray, psoas muscle shadow is wiped out in the same side and gas bubble can be observed in renal anatomical locations. Ultrasonograpy is inadequate; intravenous pyelography is not preferable due to the need of contrast material. The best imaging technique is computer tomography (CT) to show renal gas forming and associated tissues. The traditional treatment is parenteral antibiotics treatment and surgical treatment. Surgical treatment including percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) and nephrectomy. In this text, our five patients diagnosed with EPN were evaluated with the reviewing of the present literature. MATERIAL & METHODS: The patients' demographic data, clinical presentation, investigation findings, treatment, and outcome were retrospectively studied. Gas forming was reported in CT for all patients. Urine cultures, white blood cell, sedimentation and C reactive protein levels were collected. We applied a parenteral treatment which consists of ceftriaxone 1 gr 2x1 and metronidazole 500 mg 2x1 for 14 day to all patients. RESULT(S): Our patients consist of three women and two men. The mean age was 62 (range 51-82). Four patients had kidney stone and three of them had second type Diabetes Mellitus as co morbid factors. The most common clinical findings were tachycardia, fever and flank pain. The patients' Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli with a significant colony count. Radiological examination gave a diagnosis of EPN. While 3 patients were successfully treated by medical therapy alone, 1 had double J stenting according to ureterorenoscopy and 1 had ultrasound-guided PCD. The mean hospitalization period was 16 days (range 14-21). All patients were discharged with recovery. CONCLUSION(S): EPN predominantly affects female diabetics and immunocompromised patients. However, obstruction is another predisposing factor in non diabetic patients. Escherichia coli was found to be the causative organism in all the patients. Treatment comprised of resuscitation, normalization of serum electrolytes and blood sugars, administration of parenteral antibiotics, and relieving ureteric obstruction if present. Only the medical treatment can be a safe strategy in selected cases. Unlike the present literature, we think that EPN is not so mortal disease in today's conditions due to progress in medical care including the early diagnosis and treatment procedures.",Excluded
2917,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded
1703,"Evaluation of S100B in the diagnosis of suspected intracranial hemorrhage after minor head injury in patients who are receiving platelet aggregation inhibitors and in patients 65 years of age and older. OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel)., METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L., RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.",Excluded
3496,"Definition of an optimal model based on segments' contribution for the estimation of the acceleration of the center of mass in people with lower-limb amputation. Introduction In the context of rehabilitation of people with amputation, gait analysis provides information about gait alterations. In that perspective, the body center of mass (BCoM) trajectory, or its derivatives, can be used to describe how the whole body moves (Cavagna and Kaneko 1977). It is generally obtained using force plates or an optical motion capture system (OMC). However, these instruments are constrained to laboratory use. Magneto-Inertial measurement units (MIMUs) are wearable sensors that allow BCoM kinematics assessment in every-day life conditions (Pavei et al. 2020): first, the BCoM acceleration can be obtained from a weighted average of segments' center of mass (sCoM) accelerations, using MIMUs located on the segments, and then, the BCoM trajectory is estimated by integration of the obtained acceleration. Finding a balance between a limited number of sensors and good accuracy is crucial. In this respect, Shahabpoor et al. (2018) recently proposed a method to select a reduced number of MIMUs for the estimation of the 3D BCoM acceleration. However, the methodology was not applied in people with lower-limb amputation. This study aims at filling this gap. First, the most appropriate segments to include in the model are identified, then the accuracy of models based on different combinations of these segments was assessed using OMC data. 2. Methods 2.1. Experimental method The study was approved by the local ethical committee and 8 transfemoral amputees (6 males, 2 females, age: 40.8 +/- 12.6 years, mass: 70.8 +/- 17.5 kg) gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. According to the methodology reported in Al Abiad et al. (2020), the 3D trajectory of 59 reflective markers located on patients' anatomical landmarks were acquired with OMC during walking, and combined with static EOS-based biplanar x-rays acquisition. 2.2. Data processing A 15-segments hybrid inertial model constructed according to Al Abiad et al. (2020), was used to obtain sCoM inertial parameters. sCoM accelerations were obtained from OMC, and reference BCoM acceleration was obtained using the abovementioned inertial model. The contribution of each segment in the BCoM acceleration was defined as the acceleration of the sCoM, weighted by the relative mass of the segment in the body (1) Then, for each subject, Pearson's cross-correlations of sCoM accelerations were computed for each pair of segments and between each sCoM and BCoM accelerations over a complete gait cycle, for the anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML) and vertical (V) directions. For each direction, the cross-correlation matrices were averaged over all subjects. These steps allowed to define the most relevant contributing segments to the BCoM acceleration to construct a MIMUs-based experimental model with a minimal number of segments (MiNuM model). The mass of the non-selected segments was attributed to the main contributors based on sCoM accelerations cross-correlations (Shahabpoor et al. 2018). MiNuM models were validated against the reference BCoM using a leave-one-out methodology. Reference and MiNuM-based BCoM accelerations were compared over the central prosthetic gait cycle of each trial using Pearson's correlation coefficients and peak-to-peak normalized root-mean square errors (NRMSE), averaged over all patients. 3. Results and discussion A total of 22 gait cycles were analysed for the 8 participants. Trunk, pelvis, both thighs and both feet were considered as the best sensor locations to be considered (Figure 1). Finally, different MiNuM models were built (see 'Segment included' column in Table 1). Leave-one-out validation results are summarized in Table 1. The optimal MiNuM model for transfemoral amputees is based on 5 segments, i.e., trunk, both thighs and both feet. Indeed, it presented results similar to improved compared to those presented in Shahabpoor et al. (2018) in healthy subjects using the 3-sensor configuration (16%, 7%, 18% in AP, V, ML respectively) and provided a good compromise between accuracy and reduced number of sensors. 4. Conclusions This study allowed to obtain insight on the best location of sensors for 3D BCoM acceleration estimation in people with transfemoral amputation. It is worth to underline that the achieved results rely on the localization of sCoM using EOS imaging and were obtained using acceleration data derived from OMC markers. When using MIMUs, one may be confronted with additional sources of errors such as softtissue artefacts that could affect the obtained results. Therefore, the accuracy obtained using actual MIMUs as well as methodologies to correctly identify MIMU positions relative to the sCoM represent research tracks of interest.",Excluded
3380,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila. The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded
252,"Changes in boundary extension effect during spatial confinement. Changes in perception during space missions are usually attributed to microgravity. However, additional factors, such as spatial confinement, may contribute to changes in perception. We tested changes in scene perception using a boundary extension (BE) paradigm during a 105-day Earth-based space-simulation study. In addition to the close-up/wide-angle views used in BE, we presented two types of scenes based on the distance from the observer (proximal/distant scenes). In crew members (n = 6), we found that BE partly increased over time, but the size of BE error did not change in the control group (n = 22). We propose that this effect is caused by an increasing BE effect in stimuli that depict distant scenes and is related to spatial confinement. The results might be important for other situations of spatial confinement with restricted visual depth (e.g., submarine crew, patients confined to a bed). Generally, we found a larger BE effect in proximal scenes compared with the distant scenes. We also demonstrated that with no feedback, subjects preserve the level of the BE effect during repeated measurements. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of 2.45 GHz microwave (MW) radiation on dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer in mice. The subjects were 115 Balb/c mice 4 weeks of age. The animals were divided into group A (control), group B (DMH), group C (DMH+MW), and group D [DMH + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)]. Radiation (10 mW/cm2) was delivered dorsally with the E field parallel to the mouse's long body axis in an anechoic chamber. Radiations were administered 3 hr daily, 6 days per week, over a period of 5 months. The average SAR was estimated to be 10-12 W/kg. During the course of radiation treatments, DMH was injected once per week. The tumor promoter TPA was administered once per week for 10 weeks, from the third week on, after the initial treatment. The incidence of tumors did not significantly differ between the three test groups (groups B, C, and D; P > 0.25). However, the number of tumors, the size of the tumors, and the incidence of protuberant and infiltrative types in tumor-bearing animals were higher in group D compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). No difference was found between groups B and C (P > 0.25). The study indicates that 2.45 GHz microwave radiation at 10 mW/cm2 power density did not promote DMH-induced colon cancers in young mice.

A high radiation dose associated with 64 multidetector-row computed tomography (64-MDCT) is a major concern for physicians and patients alike. A new 320 row area detector computed tomography (ADCT) can obtain a view of the entire heart with one rotation (0.35 s) without requiring the helical method. As such, ADCT is expected to reduce the radiation dose. We studied image quality and radiation dose of ADCT compared to that of 64-MDCT in patients with a low heart rate (HR<=60). Three hundred eighty-five consecutive patients underwent 64-MDCT and 379 patients, ADCT. Patients with an arrhythmia were excluded. Prospective ECG-gated helical scan with high HP (FlashScan) in 64 was used for MDCT and prospective ECG-gated conventional one beat scan, for 320-ADCT. Image quality was visually evaluated by an image quality score. Radiation dose was estimated by DLP (mGycm) for 64-MDCT and DLP.e (mGycm) for 320-ADCT. Radiation dose of 320-ADCT (208+/-48 mGycm) was significantly (P<0.0001) lower than that of 64-MDCT (484+/-112 mGycm), and image quality score of 320-ADCT (3.0+/-0.2) was significantly (P=0.0011) higher than that of 64-MDCT (2.9+/-0.4).

Background: The primary aim of this prospective non-randomized study was to evaluate the effect of hemi-body irradiation (HBI) on pain and quality of life in cancer patients with extensive bone metastases. The secondary aim was to evaluate side-effects and cost-effectiveness of the treatment. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2008 and December 2010, a total of 23 (male = 14, female = 9, median age = 60 years) diagnosed cases of metastatic cancer patients (prostate = 11, breast = 6, and lung = 6) received HBI, which was delivered as lower (n = 7) (dose = 8 Gy), upper (n = 8) (dose = 6 Gy), or sequential HBI (n = 8) with a Telecobalt unit (Theratron 780C). Among them, one lung cancer patient died at 2 months and one prostate cancer patient defaulted after the second follow-up. Thus, 21 patients (male = 13, female = 8, median age = 65 years) (prostatic cancer = 10, breast cancer = 6, and lung cancer = 5) were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Evaluations were performed before and at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 weeks after treatment. Pain evaluation was done by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), Percentage of Pain Relief (PRR), and Global Pain Score (GPS). Toxicity was assessed by CTC v-3 toxicity scores in the medical record. Assessment of oral morphine consumption was done before and after radiation using paired t-test, and correlation analysis was also done with decrease of morphine consumption and reduction of pain score using statistical analysis. Result(s): Response (control of pain) was partial (PR) in 67% and complete (CR) in 22% of patients. For most patients, the pain control lasted throughout the follow-up period (6 months). From 66.66% patients requiring 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day prior to HBI, none of the patients required to consume 13 or more Morphine (10 mg) tablets per day following HBI, which was correlated with significant reduction in various pain scores (P < 0.05). One way ANOVA with Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test (P < 0.05) was significant in VAS score changes, VRS score changes, PPR score changes, and GPS score changes. Along with the decrease in morphine tablets, the Linear Correlation of various scales for pain reduction like VAS, VRS, PPR, and GPS were significant. As such, the quality of life was better due to decreased pain and also, a decrease in the dose of analgesics. Grade 1 and 2 hematological toxicity and grade 1 diarrhea were observed as common side-effects. The average total cost of treatment including hospital stay, medicines, and radiation charges was around INR 400.00. Conclusion(s): This study shows that hemibody irradiation is not only an effective modality for palliation of severe bone pain in advanced cancer cases but also economical, involves short hospital stay, with acceptable side-effects, utilizes the simple Telecobalt machine, and is less cumbersome in comparison to other currently available pain palliation methods like oral morphine and radiopharmaceuticals. © 2014.

Next, a unique optical interaction between light and individual AG NWs, as well as feature structures in the AG NWs film, was investigated by a micro-domain optical confocal microscope measurement in situ together with a theoretical explanation using modal transmission theory. That revealed that the haze problem of AG NWs films was not only arising from the interaction between light and individual or crossed Ag NWs but was also greatly dependent on a weak coupling effect of leaky modes supported by adjacent Ag NWs with large distances which had not been considered before. We then provided direct experimental evidence and concluded how to obtain haze-free films with 100% transparency in the whole visible range based on ultrathin Ag NWs. This breakthrough in diameter confinement and purification of Ag NWs is a highly expected step to overcome the well-focused light diffusion and absorption problems of Ag NWs-based devices applied in various fields such as flexible electronics, high-clarity displays, visible transparent heaters, photovoltaics and various optoelectronic technologies.",Excluded
3278,"Age assessment by magnetic resonance imaging of the knee: A preliminary study. The authors developed an original magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging system for epiphyseal fusion of growth plate maturation of the knee and evaluated its reliability and validity for age assessment of living individuals. A total of 290 MRI scans of the knee were reviewed retrospectively in patients aged from 10 to 30 years old (138 males, 152 females). Five original MRI stages were defined to assess the degree of maturation of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. Intra-observer variability was excellent and inter-observer variability was good, demonstrating the reliability and the validity of this original MRI staging system. In both sexes, the changes of growth plates (proximal tibial or distal femoral) were associated with age (p < 0.001). Our results agreed with classic data on skeletal maturation of the knee, with globally earlier maturation in females than in males, and also earlier maturation of the proximal tibial epiphysis than of the distal femoral epiphysis. MRI of the knee is an efficient non-invasive method of age assessment, without the disadvantage of X-ray exposure. Further studies with larger groups are needed to support our results. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
327,"Dynamic change of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease. PURPOSE: To evaluate the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease (DED) by using a double-pass system., METHODS: Fifty-six patients with DED and 35 control subjects were included in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford scale), and Schirmer I test. Using the tear film analysis program of the Optical Quality Analysis System, we recorded the objective scatter index (OSI) every 0.5 seconds within a 20-second period with the subjects asked to blink freely. Several parameters were established to evaluate the dynamic alterations of optical quality and the effects of blinks: OSI standard deviation (SD), DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, blinking change (BC), blinking frequency (BF), and tolerant limitation (TL)., RESULTS: Patients with DED had significant alterations of optical quality compared to control subjects. The DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, BC, and BF were significantly higher and TL was significantly lower in DED patients than controls. Furthermore, the DELTAOSI and DELTAOSI/time were also significantly higher in patients with severe DED than patients with mild disease. In univariate analysis, both TBUT and corneal staining were correlated with DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, and BC. In multivariate analysis, DELTAOSI/time was correlated to the corneal staining score., CONCLUSIONS: The double-pass system allowed the monitoring of the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with DED. Optical quality should be evaluated in patients with DED because these alterations cannot be determined from the classical DED clinical tests.",Excluded
1507,"Effect of the radioprotective drugs MEA, DMSO, and WR-2721 on tumor control and skin tolerance in the rat. Mercaptoethylamine (MEA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioate (WR-2721) were tested for their protective effects against single and fractionated doses of 250 kv X-rays. Acute and late skin reactions and control of the BA-1112 rhabdomyosarcoma were examined in protected and unprotected WAG/Rij rats. All drugs protected skin in both single and fractionated treatment regimens, with MEA giving the most protection and DMSO the least. DMSO and WR-2721 protected tumors against single doses of radiation, and all three drugs tested protected tumors against fractionated irradiation. As a result, only single-fraction treatments of MEA-protected animals showed therapeutically favorable differential protection.",Excluded
1309,"Postoperative electron-beam irradiation therapy for keloids and hypertrophic scars: Retrospective study of 147 cases followed for more than 18 months. Between 1988 and 2000, 378 cases of keloids were treated in the authors' department, and 147 keloids in 129 patients were selected for this study. Keloids that occurred at a different site in the same patient and keloids that recurred later at the same site were deemed to be different keloids. Those keloids were surgically removed, and the patients were treated postoperatively with 15-Gy electron-beam irradiation and followed for more than 18 months. The therapeutic outcomes were evaluated. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact probability test or chi-square test. Recurrence occurred in two sites on 14 earlobes (14.3 percent), in two sites on 12 necks (16.7 percent), in 22 sites on 51 anterior chest walls (43.1 percent), in 13 sites in 33 scapular regions (39.4 percent), in four sites on 15 upper limbs (26.7 percent), in four sites in 11 suprapubic regions (36.4 percent), and in one site on 11 lower limbs (9.1 percent). The overall recurrence rate was 32.7 percent. Analysis of the therapeutic outcomes showed that the recurrence rates in the sites with high stretch tension, such as the chest wall, and the scapular and suprapubic regions were statistically higher than in sites without high tension, such as the neck, earlobes, and lower limbs (41.1 percent versus 13.5 percent, p = 0.0017). The results suggested that keloid sites with a high risk of recurrence should be treated with escalated radiation doses and posttreatment self-management.",Excluded

In a multi-centre study more than 600 patient measurements of patients receiving thorax radiography were performed in five European cities. Participating centres were Fulda, Liverpool, Nicosia, Passau and Sofia. The dose quantities measured were the air kerma-area product (AKAP), incident air kerma and entrance surface air kerma (ESAK). In addition, for each patient sex, age, weight, height, focus-to-film distance, focus-to-skin distance, patient thickness, kV, mAs, field size and the nominal film speed were registered. Different X-ray machines were used in the participating centres--Thoravision, flat panel detector and film screen combinations in two centres (analogue system). The tube voltages employed varied between 60 and 150 kV and the nominal film speed between 200 and 400/800. All mean dose values (ESAK and AKAP) for the different centres showed a different value for female and male populations. The differences were up to 100 % and always higher for the mean AKAP. For a thorax posteroanterior examination, the mean ESAK varied between 0.06 and 0.46 mGy and the mean AKAP varied between 60 and 690 mGy cm(2). The differences in the results obtained as well as the methodologies for multi-national, multi-centre studies will be discussed. Future perspectives for this type of study within the framework of radiation protection and quality assurance in Europe will also be discussed as well as the role and function of multi-national radiological data sets including patient dose values.",Excluded
2131,"Prediction and prevention of transplant-related mortality from pulmonary causes after total body irradiation and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Between July 1997 and August 2004, 146 consecutive patients with hematologic malignancies received a T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an HLA-identical sibling by using total body irradiation (TBI) and cyclophosphamide conditioning regimens. Eighty-five patients received 13.6 Gy of TBI with no lung shielding, and 61 received lung shielding (total lung dose, 6-12 Gy). Ninety-four patients (65.5%) had standard-risk disease; the remainder had more advanced disease or unfavorable diagnoses. Of the 21 transplant-related deaths, 14 were from pulmonary causes (10 idiopathic pulmonary syndromes and 4 from infection) that occurred at a median of 90 days (range, 23-238 days) after transplantation. Independent risk factors for pulmonary transplant-related mortality (PTRM) were pretransplantation diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (relative risk, 5.7 for diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide <85%), smoking (relative risk, 5.0), and CD34 cell dose (relative risk, 9.4 for a CD34 dose of <5 x 106 cells per kilogram). Patients receiving lung shielding had significantly lower PTRM (3.3% versus 14.1%; P = .02) and better overall survival (70% +/- 6% versus 52% +/- 5%; P = .04), but lung shielding was not a significant independent factor for determining PTRM. These results suggest that pulmonary mortality after TBI-based preparative regimens is predictable and that higher CD34 cell doses can reduce the risk. © 2005 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded

1052,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women. BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

1612,"Release of heavy metals from retained lead projectiles and thermometer's mercury. To report three cases in which lead (cases 1, 2) and mercury (case 3) were released from retaining tissues without clinical/toxic effects. Cases series: Case 1: a 67-year-old man was hit by 200 pellets in the posterior head, right shoulder and arm. Due to a severe oedema of the arm, a fasciotomy was performed. During the following year the patient remained asymptomatic; blood and urine lead levels, collected every 3 months, resulted 4, 14, 13, 7 mcg/dL (n.v. 0.1-10 mcg/dL) and 19.4, 16.2, 55.6 mcg/L (n.v. 0.5-3.5 mcg/L). Case 2: a 43-year-old man was accidentally hit by 150pellets in the right leg. The patient required emergency surgery; during the following year blood lead levels ranged from 21.7 to 29.7 mcg/dL; the urine lead levels progressively decrease from 17.8 to 2.7 mcg/L. Either in case 1 and 2 red cell zinc-protoporphyrin, urine aminolevulinic-acid and blood film resulted always normal. Case 3: after accidental inoculation of thermometer's mercury a 31- years woman presented local oedema and numerous radio-opaque micro-droplets at the second proximal phalanx of the left hand. After a surgical toilet X-ray showed a diffused foreign material over the second metacarpal joint. During a three years follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic; no biochemical alterations neither modification on radio-opaque material distribution were registered. Blood mercury levels every 6 months resulted 5.0, 1.2, 15.0, 13.0, 4.0, 1.2 and 1.9 mcg/L (n.v. 1.0-4.5 mcg/L); urine mercury levels were 6.5, 1.0, 9.0, 4.0, 6.0, 2.7, 4.5 mcg/L (n.v. 0.1-4.5 mcg/L). Conclusion(s): Overall management of heavy metals prolonged absorption due to retained foreign bodies is not well defined. Metal absorption could be influenced by several and unpredictable factors.

OBJECTIVES: Cohen's ecological analyses revealed negative correlation between the lung cancer mortality and average indoor radon concentration in the US counties, that contradicts to linear non-threshold (LNT) model and is inconsistent with results of case-control studies. The aim of this study was to analyze dependence between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality rate taking into account more complete data on smoking and new findings on association of the lung cancer with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on the cancer rates in the US counties and Russian oblasts, smoking prevalence and indoor radon concentration was found in literature. The cervix cancer incidence rate was used as surrogate of the HPV infection prevalence. The analysis included calculation of the coefficients of linear dependence between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality rate with adjustment to smoking and HPV infection prevalence., RESULTS: After adjustment for the most relevant data on smoking and HPV infection, correlation between the lung cancer mortality and indoor radon was found to be consistent with results of the case control studies., CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of geographically aggregated data on the lung cancer mortality and radon concentration in dwellings with adjustment to the significant risk factors confirms both the linear non-threshold dependency and results obtained in studies with individual accounting for the smoking and radon.",Excluded
3234,"Comparison of simulator-CT versus simulator fluoroscopy versus surface marking based radiation treatment planning: a prospective study by three-dimensional evaluation. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Field placement for Radiation Treatment Planning can be done based on the surface markings or simulator fluoroscopy or simulator with CT facilities. A prospective study was carried out to compare these three techniques of radiation treatment planning to quantitatively find out the difference in normal tissue dosages and target volume coverage in the three groups after three-dimensional evaluation., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CT scans of 30 patients in the treatment position, taken on a Shimadzu SCT-3000 TF scanner at 1cm intervals, were transferred to Theraplan-500 three-dimensional radiation treatment planning computer. The normal tissues and target volumes (GTV and CTV) were outlined on all the CT slices as per (ICRU) Report no. 50. Three types of radiation treatment planning was done sequentially: Plan I-based on the surface markings alone, Plan II-based on simulator-fluoroscopy, and Plan III-based on Simulator-CT., RESULTS: The mean dose to 95% of the clinical target volume (D95) was increased by 4.4 and 6.4% by Plans II and III as compared with Plan I. The mean dose to 3/3rd (D(3/3)) to all the critical organs was decreased by 6.6 and 8.4% by Plans II and III as compared to Plan I. The mean time, in simulator room, for field placement for Plans I-III was 6.2, 14.6 and 44 min, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Thus for adequate coverage of target volumes and sparing normal tissues, Simulator-CT based radiation treatment planning is the best method of radiation treatment planning though it is more time consuming.",Excluded
815,"Formalin application for the treatment of radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis. Radiation-induced hemorrhagic proctitis (RIHP) is a serious complication of pelvic irradiation, and a 4% formalin solution has been used for 20 years in treating this sequelae. The first case involving formalin application for treatment of RIHP in Korea was reported in 1996, but there are no additional studies beyond this date. Our study reviews the use of formalin instillation and selective application. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the outcome of such treatments, beginning with the first case at our hospital. From 1996 to 2005, five RIHP patients had received formalin treatment for RIHP symptoms intractable to other medical treatments. All treatments were performed by a single surgeon in the operating room, under spinal anesthesia or intravenous sedation. The mean duration of symptoms before treatment was 15.6 months (which was longer than in other studies), and the transfusion before treatment varied from once per month to twice per week. Using sigmoidoscopy, 100 ml of a 4% formalin solution was instilled directly (or by using a formalin-soaked gauze) and irrigated for five minutes. Formalin-soaked cotton was then applied selectively to focal remnant lesions. Four patients improved after the first treatment, but one patient received the treatment twice because of recurrent symptoms. Complications after treatment included perianal pain (one case), and aggravated incontinence (one case), which improved three months after conservative management. In conclusion, the formalin combination application method in our study is comparable to other formalin treatments for intractable RIHP.",Excluded
319,"Investigation of sinonasal anatomy via low-dose multidetector CT examination in chronic rhinosinusitis patients with higher risk for perioperative complications. The aim of the study was to compare visualisation of the surgically relevant anatomical structures via low- and standard-dose multidetector CT protocol in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and higher risk for perioperative complications (i.e. presence of bronchial asthma, history of sinus surgery and advanced nasal polyposis). 135 adult CRS patients were divided randomly into standard-dose (120 kVp, 100 mAs) or low-dose CT groups (120 kVp, 45 mAs). The detectability of the vital anatomical structures (anterior ethmoid artery, optic nerve, cribriform plate and lamina papyracea) was scored using a five-point scale (from excellent to unacceptable) by a radiologist and sinus surgeon. Polyp sizes were quantified endoscopically according to the Lildholdt's scale (LS). Olfactory function was tested with the ""Sniffin' Sticks"" test. On the low-dose CT images, detectability ranged from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic cases to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps. Identification of lamina papyracea on low-dose scans was significantly worse in each group and the same was the case with cribriform plates in patients with advanced polyposis and anosmia. Cribriform plates were the most poorly identified (between poor and average) among all the structures on low-dose images. Identification of anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) with reduced dose was insignificantly worse than with standard-dose examination. The AEA was scored as an average-defined structure and was the second weakest visualised. In conclusion, preoperatively, low-dose protocols may not sufficiently visualise the surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with CRS and bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps (LS > 2) and history of sinus surgery. Low mAs value enables comparable detectability of sinonasal landmarks with standard-dose protocols in patients without analysed risk factors. In the context of planned surgery, the current preferences of the tube should be carefully evaluated for different patient constitutions to minimise the risk of complications.",Excluded

Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy.

828,"Utility of positron emission tomography/computed tomography in extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Background: Natural killer (NK/) T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, is an aggressive form of extranodal lymphoma that is common in Asia, but rare in Europe and North America. Although NK/T-cell lymphoma involves upper aerodigestive sites such as the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, it frequently involves other extranodal sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, bone marrow, adrenal gland, and skin. Because of the frequency of extranodal site involvement, pretreatment evaluation of disease extension is important for staging and treatment. Recently, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was evaluated for its usefulness in the prognosis and treatment response of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and relevant results were obtained. Many studies have evaluated the value of PET/CT for various types of B-cell lymphomas, but other similar studies involving T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas are rare. In the present study, we compared the utility of PET/CT and conventional modalities, particularly CT, in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Patients and Method: From January 2006 to April 2010, 19 untreated patients with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (11 males and 8 females; median age 61 years; range 13-90 years) were included in the study. PET/CT and conventional procedures (e.g., CTs and biopsies) were compared and evaluated for their abilities to detect tumor lesions and their influence in staging and treatment strategies. PET/CT was performed as an initial staging procedure. In addition to PET/CT, all patients underwent initial staging workups, including whole-body CT with contrast media, biopsies from the bone marrow and other sites, and panendoscopies of the upper aerodigestive tract. Patients were evaluated for clinical stage by both evaluation modalities (PET/CT and conventional modalities) according to the Ann Arbor Staging System, and treatment strategies were first planned based on staging results. Following PET/CT, the clinical stage was reevaluated in each patient, and treatment strategies were decided based on the re-staging results. Result(s): Seven patients (37%) had bone marrow involvement, eight (42%) were in Ann Arbor stage I-II, and 11 (58%) had a systemic dissemination. Most patients with systemic dissemination (9/11, 82%) had cutaneous lesions. The median number of disease sites was 4 (range, 1-15). The median number of positive lesions was 3 (range, 1-15) by PET/CT compared to 2 (range, 0-14) by CT (p = 0.12). Using PET/CT, 108 lesions (93%) were detected, and at least one FDG-avid lesion was observed at initial staging workups in all patients. In contrast, 70 lesions (60%) were detected by CT, and three patients (16%) did not show any positive lesion. Two lesions (2%) at the nasal cavity that were detected by biopsy were undetectable by either PET/CT or CT. The nodal and extranodal regions were separately evaluated by PET/CT and conventional modalities. In total, 28 nodal lesions were detected: all (100%) were positive by PET/CT and 26 (93%) by CT. Conversely, 89 extranodal lesions were detected, and 83 (93%) and 44 (49%) were positive by PET/CT and CT (p = 0.003), respectively. For the detection of upper aerodigestive lesions, PET/CT and CT demonstrated similar results: 23 lesions (92%) vs. 17 (68%), respectively. Notably, PET/CT was superior to CT in detecting cutaneous lesions [31 lesions (100%) vs. 19 lesions (61%), respectively; p = 0.026]. Bone marrow involvement was confirmed pathologically in only seven patients; four cases (57%) were positive by PET/CT and none by CT. Using conventional modalities, 11 patients (58%) were in the localized stage and eight (42%) were in the advanced stage. Using PET/CT, eight (42%) were in stage I-II and 11 (58%) were in stage III-IV. Most patients received chemotherapy plus local irradiation in stage I-II, and intensive chemotherapy with or without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in stage III-IV. One patient did not receive treatment because of unwillingness for treatment and older age. PET/CT findin s altered the stage and treatment strategy in four (21%) and two cases (11%). Conclusion(s): In extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, PET/CT demonstrated a high detection rate for nodal and extranodal lesions, except in the bone marrow. PET/CT may have an impact on treatment strategy and is essential for risk-adapted treatment.",Excluded

Background: Proton therapy (PT) improves outcomes in patients with nasal cavity (NC) and paranasal sinus (PNS) cancers. Herein, the authors have reported to their knowledge the largest series to date using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the treatment of these patients. Method(s): Between 2013 and 2018, a total of 86 consecutive patients (68 of whom were radiation-naive and 18 of whom were reirradiated) received PT to median doses of 70 grays and 67 grays relative biological effectiveness, respectively. Approximately 53% received IMPT. Result(s): The median follow-up was 23.4 months (range, 1.7-69.3 months) for all patients and 28.1 months (range, 2.3-69.3 months) for surviving patients. The 2-year local control (LC), distant control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 83%, 84%, 74%, and 81%, respectively, for radiation-naive patients and 77%, 80%, 54%, and 66%, respectively for reirradiated patients. Among radiation-naive patients, when compared with 3-dimensional conformal proton technique, IMPT significantly improved LC (91% vs 72%; P <.01) and independently predicted LC (hazard ratio, 0.14; P =.01). Sixteen radiation-naive patients (24%) experienced acute grade 3 toxicities; 4 (6%) experienced late grade 3 toxicities (osteoradionecrosis, vision loss, soft-tissue necrosis, and soft tissue fibrosis) (grading was performed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 5.0]). Slightly inferior LC was noted for patients undergoing reirradiation with higher complications: 11% experienced late grade 3 toxicities (facial pain and brain necrosis). Patients treated with reirradiation had more grade 1 to 2 radionecrosis than radiation-naive patients (brain: 33% vs 7% and osteoradionecrosis: 17% vs 3%). Conclusion(s): PT achieved remarkable LC for patients with nasal cavity and paranasal sinus cancers with lower grade 3 toxicities relative to historical reports. IMPT has the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio in these malignancies and is worthy of further investigation.Copyright © 2020 American Cancer Society",Excluded
1914,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

3661,"A prospective study comparing the predictions of doctors versus models for treatment outcome of lung cancer patients: a step toward individualized care and shared decision making. BACKGROUND: Decision Support Systems, based on statistical prediction models, have the potential to change the way medicine is being practiced, but their application is currently hampered by the astonishing lack of impact studies. Showing the theoretical benefit of using these models could stimulate conductance of such studies. In addition, it would pave the way for developing more advanced models, based on genomics, proteomics and imaging information, to further improve the performance of the models., PURPOSE: In this prospective single-center study, previously developed and validated statistical models were used to predict the two-year survival (2yrS), dyspnea (DPN), and dysphagia (DPH) outcomes for lung cancer patients treated with chemo radiation. These predictions were compared to probabilities provided by doctors and guideline-based recommendations currently used. We hypothesized that model predictions would significantly outperform predictions from doctors., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experienced radiation oncologists (ROs) predicted all outcomes at two timepoints: (1) after the first consultation of the patient, and (2) after the radiation treatment plan was made. Differences in the performances of doctors and models were assessed using Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis., RESULTS: A total number of 155 patients were included. At timepoint #1 the differences in AUCs between the ROs and the models were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.20 (for 2yrS, DPN, and DPH, respectively), with p-values of 0.02, 0.07, and 0.03. Comparable differences at timepoint #2 were not statistically significant due to the limited number of patients. Comparison to guideline-based recommendations also favored the models., CONCLUSION: The models substantially outperformed ROs' predictions and guideline-based recommendations currently used in clinical practice. Identification of risk groups on the basis of the models facilitates individualized treatment, and should be further investigated in clinical impact studies. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

240,"Single-arm phase II study of multiagent concurrent chemoradiotherapy and gefitinib in locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Background. This phase II study tested the addition of the oral epidermal growth factor receptor gefitinib to multiagent concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Methods. Patients with stage III-IV HNSCC received hyperfractionated radiation (72-74.4 Gy at 120 cGy twice daily), with concurrent 96-hour infusions of cisplatin 20 mg/m 2/day and fluorouracil 1000 mg/m2/day given during weeks 1 and 4. Daily gefitinib 250 mg was started on day 1 of radiation and continued for 2 years. Results. were retrospectively compared with our previous study using identical chemoradiotherapy without gefitinib. Results. Sixty patients were enrolled in the study; 80% had stage IV disease and 68% had oropharyngeal primary tumors. The full course of gefitinib was not tolerated by 42%; there were 5 treatment-related deaths (8%). With a median follow-up of 54 months, 2- and 3-year overall survival estimates were 80% and 71%, respectively. Projected distant metastatic control at 2 and 3 years was 88%. When compared with our historical cohort, acute toxicities including renal dysfunction and unplanned rehospitalization were worse in the study patients. Projected outcome estimates did not differ between the 2 cohorts. Conclusions. Addition of gefitinib to concurrent chemoradiotherapy was difficult to complete, did not improve outcomes, and increased toxicity. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2293,"Clinical PET of neuroendocrine tumors using 64Cu-DOTATATE: first-in-humans study. UNLABELLED: The use of positron emitter-labeled compounds for somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) has become attractive because of the prospect of improved spatial resolution, accelerated imaging procedures, and the ability to quantify tissue radioactivity concentrations. This paper provides results from first-in-humans use of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, an avidly binding somatostatin receptor ligand linked to a radioisotope with intermediate half-life and favorable positron energy (half-life, 12.7 h; maximum positron energy, 0.653 MeV)., METHODS: In a prospective setup, 14 patients with a history of neuroendocrine tumors underwent both PET/CT with (64)Cu-DOTATATE and SPECT/CT with our current routine imaging agent (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide. After intravenous injection of 193-232 MBq of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, whole-body PET scans were acquired at 1 h (n = 14), 3 h (n = 12), and 24 h (n = 5) after administration. Tissue radioactivity concentrations for normal organs and lesions were quantified, and standardized uptake values were calculated for the early (1 h) and delayed (3 h) scans. Using the data for 5 patients, we assessed the radiation dose with OLINDA/EXM software. Furthermore, the clinical performance of (64)Cu-DOTATATE with respect to lesion detection was compared with conventional SRI., RESULTS: SRI with (64)Cu-DOTATATE produced images of excellent quality and high spatial resolution. Images were characterized by high and stable tumor-to-background ratios over an imaging time window of at least 3 h. Compared with conventional scintigraphy, (64)Cu-DOTATATE PET identified additional lesions in 6 of 14 patients (43%). In 5 patients, lesions were localized in organs and organ systems not previously known as metastatic sites, including the early-stage detection of a secondary neuroendocrine tumor in a patient with a known mutation in the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I gene. All major additional findings seen only on PET could be confirmed on the basis of a clinical follow-up interval of 18 mo. Calculated radiation dose estimates yielded an effective dose of 6.3 mSv for an injected activity of 200 MBq of (64)Cu-DOTATATE, with the liver being the organ with the highest absorbed radiation dose (0.16 mGy/MBq)., CONCLUSION: This first-in-humans study supports the clinical use of (64)Cu-DOTATATE for SRI with excellent imaging quality, reduced radiation burden, and increased lesion detection rate when compared with (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-octreotide.",Excluded
3448,"Identifying predictors of early growth response and adverse radiation effects of vestibular schwannomas to radiosurgery. Purpose: To determine whether pre-treatment growth rate of vestibular schwannomas (VS) predict response to radiosurgery., Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all VS patients treated with 12Gy prescription dose between September 2005 and June 2011 at our institution using the Leksell Model 4C Gamma Knife Unit was conducted. Patients who had a minimum of 12-months clinical and radiological assessment before and after radiosurgery were included in this study. Tumor growth rates were calculated using specific growth rate (SGR). Tumor volumes were measured on FIESTA-MRI scans using ITK-SNAP v2.2., Results: Following radiosurgery, twenty-seven (42.9%) patients showed a significant decrease in volume after one year, twenty-nine (46.0%) stabilized, and seven (11.1%) continued to grow. There was no correlation between VS pre-treatment SGRs with post-treatment SGRs (p= 0.34), and incidence of adverse radiation effects (ARE). The reduction in tumors' SGRs after radiosurgery was proportional to pre-treatment SGRs, although this correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Analysis of risk factors revealed a positive correlation between post-treatment SGRs and incidence of non-auditory complications, most of which were attributed to ARE (p=0.047)., Conclusion: Pre-treatment growth rate of VS does not predict tumor response to radiosurgery or incidence of ARE. VS with higher SGRs post-radiosurgery are more likely to experience ARE.Copyright © 2014 Larjani et al.",Excluded
3000,"Retrospective study of immediate postoperative electron radiotherapy for therapy-resistant earlobe keloids. Keloid resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is the most efficacious treatment for keloids. However, for earlobe keloids, an optimal protocol for the total dose and fractions of adjuvant radiation has not yet been established. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of immediate three-fraction electron radiotherapy after operation for resistant earlobe keloids. From 2011 to 2017, three-fraction electron radiotherapy with single dose of 5 Gy was given postoperatively to 23 patients with 30 keloids in our hospital. The first fraction of adjuvant radiotherapy was administered within 2 h of surgery, and the other two sessions were completed within the next day or two. Five (16.7%) primary keloids and 25 (83.3%) recurrent keloids were examined in this study. The primary endpoint was the local control rate, which was 86.7% after a median follow-up of 26 months (14-93 months). Secondary endpoints were acute and late procedure-related complications, and no severe complications were observed after combination therapy. Our results suggest that three-fraction electron radiotherapy after excision within 2 days of surgery is a safe and effective protocol for the prevention of earlobe keloid recurrence that can also improve patient compliance and comfort.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
2335,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating. Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

Purpose: To show the feasibility of 3D-printed fixation masks for whole brain radiation therapy in a clinical setting and perform a first comparison to an established thermoplastic mask system. Method(s): Six patients were irradiated with whole brain radiotherapy using individually 3D-printed masks. Daily image guidance and position correction were performed prior to each irradiation fraction. The vectors of the daily position correction were compared to two collectives of patients, who were irradiated using the standard thermoplastic mask system (one cohort with head masks; one cohort with head and neck masks). Result(s): The mean systematic errors in the experimental cohort ranged between 0.59 and 2.10 mm which is in a comparable range to the control groups (0.18 mm-0.68 mm and 0.34 mm-2.96 mm, respectively). The 3D-printed masks seem to be an alternative to the established thermoplastic mask systems. Nevertheless, further investigation will need to be performed. Conclusion(s): The prevailing study showed a reliable and reproducible interfractional positioning accuracy using individually 3D-printed masks for whole brain irradiation in a clinical routine. Further investigations, especially concerning smaller target volumes or other areas of the body, need to be performed before using the system on a larger basis.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
1014,"High Vitamin D Deficiency Rate in Metabolic Inpatients: Is Bariatric Surgery Planning Found Guilty?. Background: High rates of vitamin D insufficiency are usually found in obese patients, even before any malabsorptive bariatric surgery. It is not clear whether they lack vitamin D because of different food intake, different solar exposure, or different storage pathways or bioavailability in adipose tissue. To better understand vitamin D deficiency, we studied different categories of inpatients., Methods: We collected clinical and biological data from 457 consecutive inpatients during a year: 217 nonobese diabetic patients, 159 obese nonsurgical diabetic patients, 46 obese surgical nondiabetic patients, and 35 obese surgical diabetic patients. Statistically significant differences between two mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were defined at the 5 % level using a Z-test., Results: Vitamin D deficiency was found in 69 % of the patients, while 24 % had a normal level and 7 % an optimal level. A significant difference was found between obese (25(OH)D = 40.3 nmol/l) and nonobese patients (25(OH)D = 46.8 nmol/l). Patients undergoing bariatric surgery were not different from the other obese patients., Conclusion: No significant difference in 25(OH) vitamin D level could be demonstrated between obese patients before bariatric surgery and obese patients with no obesity surgery project. No difference was found between our Parisian obese population and a Spanish obese population, which benefits from a better solar exposure. Both findings suggest that obesity itself is the link with vitamin D deficiency, independently from behavioral differences.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded

Lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) is a widely applied and useful procedure for spinal surgeries. However, posterior fixation has not yet been decided. We compared the radiographic and clinical outcomes of unilateral versus bilateral instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 100 patients, who underwent unilateral (group U) or bilateral (group B) instrumented one-level LLIF for degenerative lumbar disease. Forty-one patients in group U were undergoing unilateral pedicle screw instrumentation, and 59 patients in group B were undergoing bilateral pedicle screw instrumentation. Clinical characteristic and demographic data before surgery were compared. The intraoperative data, including operative time with changes in positions, intraoperative blood loss, and X-ray exposure time, as well as the perioperative data, including postoperative hospital stay and clinical and radiographic data were compared. As a result, Group U required a significantly shorter operating time than group B. The subsidence grade and fusion rates exhibited no significant differences in the postoperative radiographic evaluation. Group U had better results in clinical assessments than group B. However, group U required more additional surgeries owing to complications.",Excluded
1963,"Does Exposure to Computed Tomography Contrast Media Increase Risk of End-Stage Renal Disease?. BACKGROUND There are many studies on acute kidney injury (AKI) after exposure to contrast media in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, whether the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) increases after exposure to contrast media in the long term, regardless of development of AKI after such exposure, has not been studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS The electronic health records of patients diagnosed with CKD and followed up from 2014 to 2018 at a tertiary university hospital were retrospectively collected. Patients were divided into patients who progressed to ESRD (ESRD group) and those who did not (non-ESRD group). Patients in the non-ESRD group were matched 1: 1 to those in the ESRD group by using disease risk score generation and matching. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of contrast media exposure on progression to ESRD. RESULTS In total, 179 patients were enrolled per group; 178 (99.4%) were in CKD stage 3 or above in both groups. Average serum creatinine was 4.31+/-3.02 mg/dl and 3.64+/-2.55 mg/dl in the ESRD and non-ESRD groups, respectively (p=0.242). Other baseline characteristics were not statistically significant, except for the number of times contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) was performed (0.00 [Interquartile range (IQR) 0.00-2.00] in the ESRD group and 0.00 [IQR 0.00-1.00] in the non-ESRD group [p=0.006]); in multivariate logistic regression, this number (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08-1.47, p=0.006) was significantly related to progression to ESRD. CONCLUSIONS The use of CECT increased the risk of ESRD 1.2-fold in advanced and stable CKD outpatients after 5-year follow-up.",Excluded

2529,"Usefulness of metal artifact reduction with WARP technique at 1.5 and 3T MRI in imaging metal-on-metal hip resurfacings. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of the metal artifact reduction technique WARP"" in the assessment of metal-on-metal hip resurfacings at 1.5 and 3T in the context of image quality and imaging speed., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen patients (25 hip resurfacings) were randomized for 1.5 and 3T MRI, both including T1 and T2 turbo spin-echo as well as turbo inversion recovery magnitude sequences with and without view angle tilting and high bandwidth. Additional 3T sequences were acquired with a reduced number of averages and using the parallel acquisition technique for accelerating imaging speed. Artifact size (diameter, area), image quality (5-point scale) and delineation of anatomical structures were compared among the techniques, sequences and field strengths using the Wilcoxon sign-rank and paired t-test with Bonferroni correction., RESULTS: At both field strengths, WARP showed significant superiority over standard sequences regarding image quality, artifact size and delineation of anatomical structures. At 3T, artifacts were larger compared to 1.5T without affecting diagnostic quality, and scanning time could be reduced by up to 64 % without quality degradation., CONCLUSION: WARP proved useful in imaging metal-on-metal hip resurfacings at 1.5T as well as 3T with better image quality surrounding the implants. At 3T imaging could be considerably accelerated without losing diagnostic quality.""",Excluded

PURPOSE: Myocardial perfusion imaging contributes >20 % of the average medical radiation exposure to the population in the USA. Imaging protocols able to achieve a radiation exposure <=9 mSv in 50 % of the studies by 2014 have been recommended. The aim of this study was to analyse the temporal evolution of administered activities in patients scheduled for dual-day (99m)Tc tracer gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and to compare different dose administration protocols in terms of patients' effective dose., METHODS: Patients evaluated from 1 July 2002 to 31 January 2012 were allocated according to the protocol adopted: group 1: fixed activity according to diagnostic reference level: 740 MBq up to 80 kg (adapted for weight <60 kg); 900 MBq 80-100 kg, 1,110 MBq >100 kg, standard filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction; group 2: weight-adjusted activity: 8 MBq/kg up to 1,110 MBq, standard FBP reconstruction; and group 3: 4 MBq/kg, UltraSPECT wide beam reconstruction (WBR) reconstruction. A dual-head Anger camera (GE Helix) was used., RESULTS: A total of 9,060 patients were allocated to different groups: 4,751 in group 1, 2,844 in group 2 and 1,465 in group 3. The stress + rest administered activity was 1,617 +/- 180 in group 1, 1,136 +/- 260 in group 2 and 682 +/- 164 MBq in group 3 (all p < 0.001). Patients' effective dose was 13.7 +/- 3 in group 1, 9.5 +/- 2.8 in group 2 and 5.7 +/- 1.6 mSv in group 3 (all p < 0.001). The 50th percentile was 12.6 in group 1, 9.1 in group 2 and 5.3 mSv in group 3. The effective dose received by the dedicated cardiologists was 2.1, 1.5 and 1.0 muSv/exam in group 1, group 2 and group 3 periods, respectively (all p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: A significant reduction over time in the administered activity for gated SPECT was achieved; accordingly, a significant reduction in patients' exposure was obtained. A simple weight-adjusted strategy with 8 MBq/kg immediately fulfils the recommendations to limit exposure. In selected group 3 patients, a stress-only strategy allows for studies with <3 mSv exposure. Thus, at least the adoption of a new reconstruction algorithm is strongly encouraged, and suggested tracer activities for cardiac gated SPECT are to be revised.",Excluded
1168,"Geometric Image Biomarker Changes of the Parotid Gland Are Associated With Late Xerostomia. Purpose To identify a surrogate marker for late xerostomia 12 months after radiation therapy (Xer12m), according to information obtained shortly after treatment. Methods and Materials Differences in parotid gland (PG) were quantified in image biomarkers (DELTAIBMs) before and 6 weeks after radiation therapy in 107 patients. By performing stepwise forward selection, DELTAIBMs that were associated with Xer12m were selected. Subsequently other variables, such as PG dose and acute xerostomia scores, were added to improve the prediction performance. All models were internally validated. Results Prediction of Xer12m based on PG surface reduction (DELTAPG-surface) was good (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82). Parotid gland dose was related to DELTAPG-surface (P<.001, R2 = 0.27). The addition of acute xerostomia scores to the DELTAPG-surface improved the prediction of Xer12m significantly, and vice versa. The final model including DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia had outstanding performance in predicting Xer12m early after radiation therapy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.90). Conclusions Parotid gland surface reduction was associated with late xerostomia. The early posttreatment model with DELTAPG-surface and acute xerostomia scores can be considered as a surrogate marker for late xerostomia.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s)",Excluded
802,"Toxoplasma gondii: effect of sublethal irradiation on host resistance in mice. The effect of sublethal whole-body irradiation (500 rad) on the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to infection with Toxoplasma gondii was studied. Mice irradiated 1 day before or 4 days after infection via the intraperitoneal or peroral route with cysts of the mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died sooner than did unirradiated controls. The time to death of irradiated mice was suggestive of impaired acquired immunity. Irradiated mice infected intraperitoneally with T. gondii cysts exhibited reduced levels of Thy-1+CD4-CD8- cells, less natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 targets, and lower levels of IFN-gamma than controls. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also lower in infected, irradiated mice. Irradiated mice immunized with a vaccine strain of T. gondii, and later challenged with a highly virulent strain, were less well protected than unirradiated controls.

Materials/Methods: Between April 2003 and December 2010, 410 patients with primary or metastatic lung tumor received SBRT in Kyushu University Hospital, and 47 patients developed local recurrence after SBRT. Fractionated re-irradiation was performed in 16 patients who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. The median age of 16 patients was 80 years (range 52- 88 years). Fourteen patients were male, and two were female. Thirteen patients had primary lung cancer, and three had metastatic lung tumor. The median tumor size was 41 mm (range 19 - 66 mm) and three patients had regional lymph node metastases. Radiation dose ranged from 60 to 70 Gy at 1.8 - 2 Gy per fraction. Concurrent chemotherapy was given in six patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 10.2 months (range 1.6 - 21.2 months). Local re-recurrence was observed in 8 patients.

Background: The present study evaluated the correlation of hepatobiliary toxicity and radiation dose received in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) for locally advanced unresectable gall bladder cancers (LAGBC). Method(s): Twenty-six patients with LAGBC, treated with NACRT (55-57 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks and weekly gemcitabine 300 mg/m2) within a phase II study, were included. Whenever feasible, surgery was performed after NACRT. Acute and late hepatobiliary toxicity was recorded. Treatment scans were retrieved to delineate central porto-hepatobiliary system (CPHBS), resected liver surface, segment IV B and V, and duodenum. The doses received by these structures were recorded and correlated with toxicity. Result(s): Of 26 patients, 20 (77%) had partial or complete response and 12 (46%) had R0 resection. At the median follow-up of 38 months, overall survival was 38%. Eight (30%) patients had post-treatment toxicity, of which most common was biliary toxicity (30%). A correlation was observed between the biliary leak and V45Gy CPHBS >50 cm3 (P = 0.070). Higher toxicity was observed in those with metallic stents (P = 0.072). Conclusion(s): The incidence of the biliary leak was 46%. CPHBS dose was found to correlate with biliary leaks.

2301,"Interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus does delayed surgery have an impact on outcome?. Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) affects postoperative outcomes in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thoracic esophagus. Background(s): Esophagectomy is usually recommended within 4 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant CRT. However, the optimal timing of surgery is not clearly defined. Method(s): A total of 129 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, treated between 1998 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of timing to surgery: group 1, <=30 days (n = 17); group 2, 31 to 60 days (n = 83); and group 3, 61 to 90 days (n = 29). Subsequently, only 2-numerically more consistent-groups were studied, using the median value of timing intervals as a cutoff level: group A, <=46 days (n = 66); and group B, <46 days (n = 63). Result(s): Groups were comparable in terms of patient and tumor characteristics, type of neoadjuvant regimen, toxicity, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, tumor downstaging, and pathologic complete responses. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0% in group 1, 43.1% in group 2, and 35.9% in group 3 (P = 0.13). After R0 resection (n = 106), the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0%, 51%, and 47.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). Tumor recurrence after R0 resection seemed to be inversely related, even if not significantly (P = 0.17), to the time interval between chemoradiation and surgery: 50% in group 1, 40.6% in group 2, and 21.7% in group 3. When considering only 2 groups, the overall 5-year survival was 33.1% in group A and 42.7% in group B (P = 0.64); after R0 resection, the 5-year survival was 37.8% and 56.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). The rate of tumor recurrence was significantly lower in group B (25%) than in group A (48.3%) (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not compromise the outcomes of patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. Delaying surgery up to 90 days offers relevant advantages in the clinical management of the patients, can reduce tumor recurrences, and may improve prognosis after complete R0 resection surgery.

The aim of this retrospective, explorative analysis was to define the role of recent treatment strategies and to examine the value of different prognostic factors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients was analyzed. Complete resection, partial resection, and biopsy was accomplished in 69, 22, and 19 patients, respectively. 56 patients received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy with a median total dose of 60 Gy, 2 Gy daily. 54 patients received hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a median total dose of 54 Gy, 2 x 1.8 Gy daily. 20 patients had concomitant temozolomide (50-75 mg/m2/d), and 20 patients concomitant topotecan (0.5 mg/m2 as continuous venous infusion over 21 days). 37 patients received temozolomide as salvage therapy., RESULTS: Median overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 8.7 and 4.8 months. After complete resection, partial resection, and biopsy, OS was 9.5, 8.5, and 5.5 months, respectively. OS was 8.5, 13.8, and 8.2 months for radiotherapy alone, concomitant temozolomide, and concomitant topotecan, respectively. Hazard ratio was 0.29 (OS; p = 0.002) and 0.32 (DFS; p = 0.003) for concomitant temozolomide compared to radiotherapy alone. Topotecan led to an increased toxicity. With 9.7 months for conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and 8.1 months for hyperfractionated radiotherapy, OS differed significantly (p = 0.003, log-rank test). OS in patients with RPA (recursive partitioning analysis) score III, IV, V, and VI was 14.1, 10, 9.5, and 5.8 months (p = 0.003, log-rank test). In the univariate (p = 0.0001, log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.002, Cox regression), salvage temozolomide led to a statistically significant survival benefit (10.6 vs. 7.7 months)., CONCLUSION: Concomitant topotecan or the use of hyperfractionated radiotherapy did not show to be superior in outcome in this retrospective analysis. Topotecan led to an increased toxicity. An attempt at complete resection is justified. Temozolomide should be integrated in therapy initially. As salvage therapy, temozolomide is also effective.",Excluded
2923,"Opioid prescription patterns among radiation oncologists in the United States. Background: Radiation oncologists (ROs) play an important role in managing cancer pain; however, their opioid prescribing patterns remain poorly described. Method(s): The 2016 Medicare Physician Compare National Downloadable and the 2016 Medicare Part D Prescriber Data files were cross-linked to identify RO-written opioid prescriptions. Result(s): Of 4,627 identified ROs, 1,360 (29.3%) wrote >10 opioid prescriptions. The average number of opioid prescriptions written was significantly (P <=.05) associated with the following RO characteristics: sex [13.1 +/- 36.5 male vs 7.5 +/- 16.9 female]; years since medical school graduation [4.5 +/- 11.5 1-10 years vs 12.6 +/- 26.0 11-24 years vs 13.3 +/- 40.9 >=25 years]; practice size [15.5 +/- 44.6 size <=10 vs 13.3 +/- 25.9 size 11-49 vs 8.5 +/- 12.7 size 50-99 vs 8.8 +/- 26.9 size >=100]; Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) participation [12.6 +/- 31.8 yes vs 7.0 +/- 35.4 no]; and practice location [17.4 +/- 47.0 South vs 10.6 +/- 29.4 Midwest vs 8.1 +/- 13.9 West vs 6.9 +/- 15.2 Northeast].

Conclusion(s): Factors associated with increased number of RO-written opioid prescriptions were male sex, >=25 years since graduation, group practice <10, PQRS participation, and Southern location. Additional research is required to establish optimal opioid prescribing practices for ROs.Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
2913,"[Occurrence of immune hyperthyroidism after radioiodine therapy of autonomous goiter]. AIM: The goal of the study was to examine the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 treatment of autonomous goiter with special regard to pretreatment scintigraphic patterns., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Pre- and posttreatment in-vitro and in-vivo parameters were studied in 375 consecutive patients treated with I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. All patients included were within ambulant control for at least 2.5 months following treatment. According to the pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scan 59% (220/375) had multifocal (MF), 23% (86/375) unifocal (UF), 10% (38/375) mixed focal-disseminated (FD) and 8% (31/375) disseminated (D) scintigraphic patterns., RESULTS: In 93.9% (352/375), the autonomous tissue was totally, in 2.1% (8/375) partially and in 1.6% (6/375) insufficiently eliminated. In 2.4% (9/375) a relapse of hyperthyroidism was observed 2 to 10 months following I-131 therapy. In 8 patients a relapse of hyperthyroidism was accompanied or followed by an elevation of the previously non-elevated TSH-receptor antibody (TRAb) level and in 1 patient by an TRAb increase to the upper borderline range implicating Graves' disease. With the prevalence of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy a statistically significant difference in pretreatment Tc-99m pertechnetate scintigraphic patterns was found: 0% of unifocal (0/86) or multifocal (0/220), however 18% (7/38) of focal-disseminated and 7% (2/31) of disseminated scintigraphic patterns. From the 366 patients without relapse of hyperthyroidism 2 (MF) had elevated pre- and posttreatment TRAb levels and 3 (D) had elevated TRAb levels for the first time after I-131 therapy., CONCLUSION: There is a low overall prevalence (2.4%) of Graves' disease following I-131 therapy for nodular or diffuse autonomous goiter. However, the prevalence of posttreatment Graves' disease is highly dependent upon pretreatment scintigraphic patterns exhibiting focal-disseminated or disseminated patterns.",Excluded
261,"Prospective Randomized Comparison of Knee Stability and Proprioception for Posterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction With Autograft, Hybrid Graft, and gamma-Irradiated Allograft. PURPOSE: To evaluate posterior stability and proprioception after arthroscopic posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autograft, hybrid graft, and gamma-irradiated allograft., METHODS: This prospective, randomized controlled trial (with 5 years' follow-up) included 90 patients who underwent posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with autograft (gracilis and semitendinosus tendons), hybrid graft (gamma-irradiated tibialis anterior tendon allograft and semitendinosus tendon autograft), or gamma-irradiated allograft (tibialis anterior tendons). All the gamma-irradiated allografts (tibialis anterior tendons) received an irradiation dose of 2.5 Mrad before distribution. Patients in this study had undergone a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan and physical examination. Patients were excluded from the study if they had a concomitant injury to other knee ligaments, previous surgery on the injured knee, or articular cartilage lesions greater than Outerbridge grade II. Clinical and proprioceptive evaluation results were collected preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months after surgery., RESULTS: The autograft, allograft, and hybrid graft groups were followed up for 5.5 +/- 0.2 months (range, 5 to 6 years), 5.7 +/- 0.3 months (range, 5 to 6 years), and 5.6 +/- 0.5 months (range, 5 to 6 years), respectively. No statistically significant differences were found among the 3 groups regarding preoperative demographic factors (P > .05). The differences in physical examination findings and subjective evaluations among the 3 groups were not significant (P > .05). However, a significant difference was detected in instrumented anteroposterior measurements, with more laxity shown in the gamma-irradiated allograft group than in the other 2 groups (P = .006)., CONCLUSIONS: The differences in proprioceptive and functional outcomes among the 3 groups were not significant. In contrast, a significant difference was detected in instrumented anteroposterior measurements, which showed more laxity in the gamma-irradiated allograft group than in the other 2 groups.

1830,"Detection of pulmonary embolism with combined ventilation-perfusion SPECT and low-dose CT: head-to-head comparison with multidetector CT angiography. UNLABELLED: The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is usually established by a combination of clinical assessment, D-dimer testing, and imaging with either pulmonary ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy or pulmonary multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography. Both V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography seem to have high diagnostic accuracy. However, only limited data directly comparing these 2 modalities are available. Hybrid gamma-camera/MDCT systems have been introduced and allow simultaneous 3-dimensional lung V/Q SPECT and MDCT angiography, suitable for diagnosing PE. The aim of our study was to compare, in a prospective design, the diagnostic ability of V/Q SPECT, V/Q SPECT combined with low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography obtained simultaneously using a combined SPECT/MDCT scanner in patients suspected of having PE., METHODS: Consecutive patients from June 2006 to February 2008 suspected of having acute PE were referred to the Department of Nuclear Medicine at Rigshospitalet or Frederiksberg Hospital, Denmark, for V/Q SPECT as a first-line imaging procedure. The number of eligible patients was 196. Patients with positive D-dimer results (>0.5 mmol/mL) or a clinical assessment with a Wells score greater than 2 were included and underwent V/Q SPECT, low-dose CT, and pulmonary MDCT angiography in a single session. Patient follow-up was 6 mo., RESULTS: A total of 81 simultaneous studies were available for analysis, of which 38% were from patients with PE. V/Q SPECT had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 88%. When low-dose CT was added, the sensitivity was still 97% and the specificity increased to 100%. Perfusion SPECT with low-dose CT had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 51%. MDCT angiography alone had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 100%., CONCLUSION: We conclude that V/Q SPECT in combination with low-dose CT without contrast enhancement has an excellent diagnostic performance and should therefore probably be considered first-line imaging in the work-up of PE in most cases.",Excluded
1355,"Is it necessary to approach the severe osteoporotic vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture bilaterally during the process of pkp?. Purpose: The goal of this study was to explore the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral approach percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using CT-guidance in the treatment of severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients with severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture who had undergone unilateral and bilateral PKP surgeries using CT-guidance at our hospital between June 2013 and June 2019, and followed for at least 1 year. All patients were divided into unilateral (the transverse process-pedicle approach, n = 49) and bilateral (the pedicle approach, n = 40) groups. We collected the clinical and radiological evaluation results during postoperative and last follow-up periods. Result(s): Our findings revealed that the surgery time for the unilateral group was significantly shorter than that of the bilateral group at P < 0.05. The amount of bone cement and radiation exposure of the unilateral group were significantly lesser than that of the bilateral group (P < 0.05). Relative to preoperative data, the values of the VAS score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were significantly improved at 1 day after surgery and the last followup in the two groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the median height of vertebra at 1 day after surgery and the last follow-up in the unilateral group was significantly restored than that of preoperative data (P < 0.05). However, the median height of vertebra at the same time intervals in the bilateral group showed no significant change compared with preoperative data (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of bone cement leakage and incidence of adjacent-level vertebra fracture were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). Finally, both groups can obtain an asymmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra. Conclusion(s): Compared to the bilateral PKP, unilateral PKP using CT-guidance in the treatment of the sOVBFs exhibits significantly shorter operation time, lesser radiation dose, and complications. Moreover, unilateral PKP can restore the median height of the vertebral body and eventually obtain a symmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra.Copyright © 2021 Tan et al.",Excluded
3284,"Post-remission treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukaemia: A time-dependent analysis. Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. Method(s): For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. Finding(s): 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Interpretation(s): Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

Some are implicated in serious genitourinary tract infections in men and women resulting in significant perinatal mortality and morbidity; others can cause respiratory tract infections. M. hominis has been implicated in wound infections, osteomyelitis, and infections of the heart valve. Because these microorganisms are pathogens, their survival in a closed water system has relevance to the well-being of crew members in an enclosed space.

3609,"Determination of solar ultraviolet dose in the Dead Sea treatment of psoriasis. BACKGROUND: An increased risk of developing cancer of the skin is the only potentially serious (albeit unproven) long-term side effect of heliotherapy and it is therefore prudent to avoid unnecessary exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation. Traditional heliotherapy for psoriasis at the Dead Sea calls for a sun exposure of 5-6 hours daily for 28 days. Studies have determined that mid-summer exposure for 3 hours is equally effective., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of 3 hours sun exposure daily in the heliotherapy of psoriasis at the Dead Sea during the months March to December; and to monitor the associated ambient doses of solar UVB radiation., METHODS: A total of 194 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis was treated in the months of March to December by 3 hours of sun exposure each day. The dose of ambient solar UVB was monitored by a Solar Model 501A UVB-Biometer., RESULTS: Three hours of sun exposure daily was therapeutically efficacious in all months from March to November, but not in December. The lowest effective cumulative UVB dose was 170 SED (standard erythema dose), recorded in March and November., CONCLUSIONS: Daily sun exposure for the heliotherapy of psoriasis at the Dead Sea can be reduced to at least 3 hours daily, about half the time originally recommended.",Excluded
2537,"Evaluation of light-emitting diode (LED-835 NM) application over human gingival fibroblast: An in vitro study. Since the laser and photomodulation were discovered over 50 years, they have been used for many applications in medicine and in dentistry also. In particular, light-emitting diodes therapy (LT) achieved a great success in medical treatment and photo-therapy. In the decades, LT has been used for several therapeutic purposes. Many beneficial effects have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor, cell differentiation, immune potentiating and tissue repair activities. Beneficial effects of LT have also been observed in clinical settings. Although there are lots of cell culture studies in low-level laser therapy, there are only a few cell culture studies in LT that have similar characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of LT on primary human gingival fibroblast cells (HGF) on elastin (ELN) gene activation using Real Time PCR. ELN gene activation is directly connected with elastin protein production and HGF functionality. Human gingival tissue biopsies were obtained from three healthy patients during tooth extraction. The gingival specimens were fragmented with a scalpel and transferred in culture dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum (FBS) and antibiotics, i.e. penicillin 100U/ml and streptomycin 100mug/ml. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37C. The medium was changed the next day and twice a week. After 15 days, the samples of gingival tissue were removed from the culture dishes. Cells were harvested after an additional 24 h incubation. Human gingival fibroblasts at the second passage were seeded on multiple 6-well plates. The cells stimulation was performed with a light-emitting diodes (LEDs) medical device type E-Light. The LED irradiation seems to be directly correlated with the elastin (ELN) gene activation. Interestingly, ELN gene expression in the cultured human gingival fibroblasts seems to be inversely related to the patients' age; in fact, its expression tends to decrease with aging. In summary, the result of the present study shows that LED irradiation promoted ELN gene expression more in elderly than in younger adults.Copyright © by BIOLIFE, s.a.s.",Excluded
279,"Economic Analysis of a Three-Arm RCT Exploring the Delivery of Intensive, Prophylactic Swallowing Therapy to Patients with Head and Neck Cancer During (Chemo)Radiotherapy. Research advocates for the use of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to help reduce the severity of dysphagia in patients receiving (chemo)radiotherapy ([C]RT) for head/neck cancer (HNC). Unfortunately, the intensity of this therapy, coupled with growing patient numbers and limited clinical resources, provides challenges to many international cancer facilities. Telepractice has been proposed as a potential method to provide patients with greater support in home-practice, whilst minimising burden to the health service. This study investigated the clinical and patient-attributable costs of delivering an intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy protocol via a new telepractice application ""SwallowIT"" as compared to clinician-directed FTF therapy and independent patient self-directed therapy. Patients (n = 79) with oropharyngeal HNC receiving definitive (C)RT were randomised to receive therapy via a: clinician-directed (n = 26), patient-directed (n = 27), or SwallowIT-assisted (n = 26) model of care. Data pertaining to health service costs (service time, consumables, therapy resources), patient-attributable costs (travel and wages) and patient-reported health-related quality of life (QoL) (AQoL-6D) were collected. SwallowIT provided a cost-efficient model of care when compared to the clinician-directed model, with significant cost savings to both the health service and to HNC consumers (total saving of $1901.10 AUD per patient; p < 0.001). The SwallowIT model also proved more cost-effective than the patient-directed model, yielding clinically significantly superior QoL at the end of (C)RT, for comparable costs. Overall, when compared to the alternate methods of service-delivery, SwallowIT provided a financially viable and cost-effective method for the delivery of intensive, prophylactic swallowing therapy to patients with HNC during (C)RT.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of low (1110 MBq (30 mCi)) and high (3700 MBq (100 mCi)) 131I doses on the ablation of post-surgical remnants in patients with thyroid cancer based on the measurement of post-operative cervical uptake., METHODS: The study was conducted on 155 patients without metastases after thyroidectomy who received a 1110 or 3700 MBq ablative dose and who were assessed by pre-therapy cervical uptake. The patients were divided into six groups according to the uptake result and the dose received. Successful therapy was defined as a negative scan 6 months to 1 year after ablation., RESULTS: Ablative therapy was successful in 90% of patients with uptake <2% who received the 1110 MBq dose (n=30) and in 92.5% of patients who received the 3700 MBq dose (n=40), P=0.95.

PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1844,"Radiation dose savings for adult pulmonary embolus 64-MDCT using bismuth breast shields, lower peak kilovoltage, and automatic tube current modulation. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether radiation dose savings using a lower peak kilovoltage (kVp) setting, bismuth breast shields, and automatic tube current modulation could be achieved while preserving the image quality of MDCT scans obtained to assess for pulmonary embolus (PE)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT angiography (CTA) examinations were performed to assess for the presence or absence of pulmonary artery emboli using a 64-MDCT scanner with automatic tube current modulation (noise level=10 HU), two kVp settings (120 and 140 kVp), and bismuth breast shields. Absorbed organ doses were measured using anthropomorphic phantoms and metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) detectors. Image quality was assessed quantitatively as well as qualitatively in various anatomic sites of the thorax., RESULTS: Using a lower kVp (120 vs 140 kVp) and automatic tube current modulation resulted in a dose savings of 27% to the breast and 47% to the lungs. The use of a lower kVp (120 kVp), automatic tube current modulation, and bismuth shields placed directly on the anterior chest wall reduced absorbed breast and lung doses by 55% and 45%, respectively. Qualitative assessment of the images showed no change in image quality of the lungs and mediastinum when using a lower kVp, bismuth shields, or both., CONCLUSION: The use of bismuth breast shields together with a lower kVp and automatic tube current modulation will reduce the absorbed radiation dose to the breast and lungs without degradation of image quality to the organs of the thorax for CTA detection of PE.",Excluded

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 2009 to January 2012, we enrolled blunt trauma patients older than 14 years who received chest radiography in this prospective, observational, diagnostic decision instrument study at 9 US level I trauma centers. Prior to viewing radiographic results, physicians recorded the presence or absence of the NEXUS Chest 7 clinical criteria (age >60 years, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, abnormal alertness/mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness to chest wall palpation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thoracic injury seen on chest imagingwas defined as pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, and pulmonary contusion or laceration seen on radiographs. An expert panel generated an a priori classification of clinically major, minor, and insignificant TICIs according to associated management changes. RESULTS Of 9905 enrolled patients, 43.1%had a single CXR, 42.0% had CXR and chest CT, 6.7%had CXR and abdominal CT (without chest CT), 5.5%had multiple CXRs without CT, and 2.6%had chest CT alone in the emergency department. The most common trauma mechanisms were motorized vehicle crash (43.9%), fall (27.5%), pedestrian struck by motorized vehicle (10.7%), bicycle crash (6.3%), and struck by blunt object, fists, or kicked (5.8%). Thoracic injury seen on chest imaging was seen in 1478 (14.9%) patients with 363 (24.6%) of these having major clinical significance, 1079 (73.0%) minor clinical significance, and 36 (2.4%) no clinical significance. NEXUS Chest had a sensitivity of 98.8% (95%CI, 98.1%-99.3%), a negative predictive value of 98.5%(95%CI, 97.6%.6-99.1%), and a specificity of 13.3%(95%CI, 12.6%-14.1%) for TICI. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for TICI with clinically major injury were 99.7%(95%CI, 98.2%-100.0%) and 99.9% (95%CI, 99.4%-100.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We have validated the NEXUS Chest decision instrument, which may safely reduce the need for chest imaging in blunt trauma patients older than 14 years.",Excluded
2129,"Tumor response after low-dose preoperative radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy for squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. AIM: Patients with T3 or more squamous cell esophageal cancer underwent low-dose preoperative radiotherapy with chemotherapy, to reduce local recurrence, followed by surgery. The aim was to ascertain tumor response and assess prognostic factors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2002 and June 2011, 37 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. The numbers of patients in clinical stages IIA/IIIA/IIIB/IIIC were 2/24/7/4, respectively. All were given a dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions, with concurrent chemotherapy using cisplatin and fluorouracil. Curative surgery was performed a median of 1.2 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy., RESULTS: Based on the findings from surgery, 26 patients (70%) achieved a stage reduction and six patients (16%) had a complete pathological response. The numbers of patients undergoing resections microscopically complete, with microscopically positive margins, and macroscopically positive margins were 33, 3, and 1, respectively. During a median follow-up period of 22.5 months, the two-year progression-free survival and overall survival were 62.1% [95% confidence interval (CI)=45.8 to 78.4%] and 71.9% [95% CI=55.1 to 88.7%], respectively. Statistically significant prognostic factors for overall survival were age [hazard ratio=6.6; 95% CI=1.1 to 38; p=0.04] and pathological T factor [hazard ratio=10.2; 95% CI=1.4 to 77; p=0.02]. No patients died as a result of surgery., CONCLUSION: Seventy percent of patients with esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy dose of 30 Gy in 15 fractions combined with chemotherapy achieved a stage reduction with low toxicity.",Excluded
1567,"A randomized trial of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy and bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea for malignant glioma. A preliminary report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02. BACKGROUND: The third and final randomization of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 83-02 was performed to identify the maximal tolerated dose and potential efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in 1.6 Gy twice-daily fractions for adult malignant glioma., METHODS: From December 1987 to July 1989, 304 patients with malignant glioma were stratified by age, performance status, and histologic findings and randomized to receive total AHRT doses of 48.0 or 54.4 Gy, with 80 mg/m2 of bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) for 3 days every 8 weeks. Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded
798,"Effects of Probiotics with or without Honey on Radiation-induced Diarrhea. Background: Diarrhea is a well-recognized side effect associated with pelvic radiation; however, there is not any effective common treatment for radiation-induced diarrhea. A popular alternative is probiotics, which have been used in several gastrointestinal disorders. Probiotics are live microbial food supplements. Furthermore, honey is a putative nutritional with a variety of health effects, including antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and prebiotic. The present study evaluated the effects of probiotic with or without honey on radiation-induced diarrhea. Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty-seven adult patients with pelvic cancer underwent radiotherapy for four weeks. They randomized to receive probiotic (n = 22), probiotic plus honey (n = 21) or placebo (n = 24) from one week before radiotherapy for five weeks. Diarrhea grade and stool consistency score were recorded weekly according to the Common Toxicity Criteria system and the Bristol scales, respectively. Result(s): The results showed a decrease in the daily number of bowel movements (p = 0.003 and 0.006), diarrhea grade (p = 0.001 and 0.001) and the need for antidiarrheal medication (p = 0.021 and 0.041) also an increase in the stool consistency (p = 0.004 and 0.005) in patients who either used probiotic or probiotic plus honey (respectively), these were significant in weeks 4 and 5 of treatment. Conclusion(s): Probiotics with or without honey can reduce the incidence of radiation-induced diarrhea and the need for antidiarrheal medication.",Excluded
755,"Treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (70 Gy): Equivalent or superior to 60 or 74 Gy of RTOG 0617?. Purpose/Objective(s): RTOG 0617 demonstrated inferior outcomes with 74 Gy of concurrent radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (CT) compared to 60 Gy, though the findings are controversial. We hypothesized that an intermediate RT dose might reach equipoise and improve outcomes versus 60 Gy or 74 Gy. This retrospective single institution analysis analyzed patients treated uniformly with 70 Gy/concurrent CT. Materials/Methods: Records from 216 consecutive patients with Stage III NSCLC treated from 2000 to 2015 with concurrent CTand RT (70 Gy) were reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor/treatment details and outcomes were abstracted. Local failure (LF), regional failure (RF), distant failure (DF), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier univariate (UVA) and Cox-regression multivariate (MVA) analyses. Predictors of toxicity were evaluated by Pearson Chi-Square. Result(s): Median follow-up was 18 months. Median age was 63 years; 53% were female. Histology: adenocarcinoma (49%), squamous cell carcinoma (32%), other (19%). Patients were mostly stage IIIB (50.4%), T3/T4 (53.7%), N2 (64%) and N3 (28%), and were ECOG 0 (33%), 1 (56%), and 2 (11%) at diagnosis. CT included platinum doublets (94%), weekly (52%), induction (12%) and consolidative (22%) therapy. Median OS was 26 months and 2-yr survival was 58.1%. The 2-yr OS for IIIA and IIIB patients was 61.8% and 42.4%, respectively. The overall 2-yr LF, RF, and DF rates were 30.4%, 32.9% and 54.9%, respectively. 2-yr DFS was 28.8%. In UVA, ECOG predicted for LF (PZ0.004) and RF (PZ0.006). DF was associated with N stage (N0/1/2 vs. N3; P = 0.013), ECOG (P = 0.03) and IIIA vs. IIIB (P = 0.011). N stage (P = 0.041), ECOG (PZ0.0001) and overall stage (PZ0.007) were predictive of DFS. Stage (P = 0.003) and ECOG (P = 0.002) predicted for improved OS. ECOG was significant on MVA for LF, RF, DF, DFS and OS, while N stage was predictive for RF, DF, DFS and OS. Toxicity was manageable: 10.6% had Grade 3 esophagitis and 15.7% and 1.9% had Grade 2 or 3 pneumonitis with no Grade 4/5 events. Esophageal ulceration and dilation rates were 16.2% and 10.6%, respectively. Esophagitis grade was predictive of ulceration (P = 0.0001) or dilation (P = 0.0001). N stage (P = 0.008) and overall stage (P = 0.022) were predictive of pneumonitis grade. Conclusion(s): Patients in our cohort were frailer and had more advanced disease than the 0617 patients. Despite this, we demonstrate that CT with an intermediate RT dose of 70 Gy leads to better outcomes than the 74 Gy arm in RTOG 0617 with less esophageal toxicity. Preliminary analysis suggests that omission of ECOG-2 patients leads to superior outcomes for 70 Gy compared with the 60 Gy patients in 0617; analysis is ongoing.

3584,"Cardiac valve calcifications on low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography: Inter-observer and inter-examination reliability, agreement and variability. Objectives: To determine inter-observer and inter-examination variability for aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral valve and annulus calcification (MC) in low-dose unenhanced ungated lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): We included 578 lung cancer screening trial participants who were examined by CT twice within 3 months to follow indeterminate pulmonary nodules. On these CTs, AVC and MC were measured in cubic millimetres. One hundred CTs were examined by five observers to determine the inter-observer variability. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics (kappa) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Variability was expressed as the mean difference +/- standard deviation (SD). Result(s): Inter-examination reliability was excellent for AVC (kappa=0.94, ICC=0.96) and MC (kappa=0.95, ICC=0.90). Inter-examination variability was 12.7+/-118.2 mm3 for AVC and 31.5+/-219.2 mm3 for MC. Inter-observer reliability ranged from kappa=0.68 to kappa=0.92 for AVC and from kappa=0.20 to kappa=0.66 for MC. Inter-observer ICC was 0.94 for AVC and ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 for MC. Inter-observer variability ranged from -30.5+/-252.0 mm3 to 84.0+/-240.5 mm3 for AVC and from -95.2+/-210.0 mm3 to 303.7+/-501.6 mm 3 for MC. Conclusion(s): AVC can be quantified with excellent reliability on ungated unenhanced low-dose chest CT, but manual detection of MC can be subject to substantial inter-observer variability. Lung cancer screening CT may be used for detection and quantification of cardiac valve calcifications. Key points: * Low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography can detect cardiac valve calcifications. * However, calcified cardiac valves are not reported by most radiologists. * Inter-observer and inter-examination variability of aortic valve calcifications is sufficient for longitudinal studies. * Volumetric measurement variability of mitral valve and annulus calcifications is substantial. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3159,"Cognitive function and social attainment in adult survivors of retinoblastoma: A report from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study. BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma has a 5-year survival rate exceeding 95%, yet little is known about long-term functional outcomes for these patients. METHOD(S): Sixty-nine adult survivors of retinoblastoma (mean age, 33 years; mean years post-diagnosis, 31) who had enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study completed clinical cognitive evaluations and questionnaires assessing adult social attainment. Scores on all cognitive measures were converted to z-scores (M = 0, SD = 1) using age-adjusted normative data. Multivariable linear regression analyses, adjusted for age at diagnosis and disease laterality, were used to examine associations between disease and treatment exposures and cognitive outcomes. RESULT(S): Retinoblastoma survivors performed within normative expectations across most cognitive domains. In multivariable models, adjusted for disease laterality, survivors diagnosed at <1 year of age performed significantly better on measures of short-term verbal memory (beta=0.87, P<.01), long-term verbal memory (beta=0.66, P=.02), verbal learning (beta = 0.67, P=.02), and verbal reasoning abilities (beta = 0.79, P<.01) compared with survivors diagnosed at <=1 year of age. In multivariable models, restricted to bilateral survivors and adjusted for age at diagnosis, whole brain radiation exposure was significantly associated with poorer performance on tasks of short-term verbal memory (beta=-0.003, P = .03) and long-term verbal memory (beta = 20.003, P = .01). Reported social attainment was consistent with adult developmental expectations. CONCLUSION(S): Adult survivors of retinoblastoma demonstrate few cognitive or social attainment deficits decades following diagnosis and treatment. Findings suggest the potential for neural reorganization following early insult to the visual system as well as vulnerability of the developing brain to low dose radiation exposure. Early intervention and rehabilitation will be important for these patients.Copyright © 2014 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
2585,"An in silico planning study comparing doses and estimated risk of toxicity in 3D-CRT, IMRT and proton beam therapy of patients with thymic tumours. PURPOSE: To compare the dose distributions produced in patients (pts) treated for thymic tumours with spot-scanning proton beam therapy (PBT) implemented with single-field uniform dose (SFUD), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal photon-beam based radiotherapy (3D-CRT)., METHODS: Twelve pts, treated with 3D-CRT, were included. Alternative IMRT and SFUD plans were constructed. The IMRT plans were created using a setup with beams incident from 5 to 6 different angles. For the SFUD plans, a field-specific planning target volume (PTV) was created for each patient and a clinical target volume (CTV)-based robust optimization was performed. A robustness evaluation was performed for the CTV for all SFUD plans. A dosimetric evaluation was conducted for the doses to the CTV and organs at risk (OARs) for all plans. The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), for different endpoints, was calculated using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB)-model and compared between plans., RESULTS: SFUD was associated with significantly lower mean doses to the oesophagus, the heart, the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), lungs and breasts compared to 3D-CRT and IMRT. The maximum dose given to the spinal cord was significantly lower with SFUD. The risks for pneumonitis, esophagitis and myelopathy were significantly reduced in the SFUD plans., CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed dosimetric advantages of using scanned-beam PBT for the treatment of thymic tumours, as compared to 3D-CRT and IMRT, especially in regard to lower doses to the oesophagus and lungs. The risk of toxicity was reduced with SFUD. Copyright © 2019. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
2652,"What are the clinical and technical factors that influence the kerma-area product in percutaneous coronary intervention?. The purpose of the paper is to define predictors of the kerma-area product (KAP) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Two new digital X-ray interventional cardiology systems recently installed were included. A total of 398 PCI procedures were carried out by 6 board-certified senior interventional cardiologists with more than 15 years' experience and good knowledge of radiation protection measures. Clinical, radiation and procedural data were collected based on a detailed protocol developed by the SENTINEL cardiology subgroup. Correlation with clinical and procedure factors was then investigated. A significant correlation was found between fluoroscopy time and (i) lesion classification, (ii) the level of tortuosity and (iii) the number of vessels treated. No statistically significant differences were observed in the complexity of the case between operators. However, large differences were found in the KAP among operators, which were mostly attributed to the different number of frames taken by each operator. There was no statistically significant correlation between complexity and the total number of frames. The study showed that, in certain circumstances, the clinical need to successfully perform PCI takes precedence over radiation safety concerns.",Excluded

PURPOSE: Quantitative evaluation of the lung parenchyma might be impaired or unreliable by use of reduced-dose CT protocols. Aim of the study was to define the threshold where reduced dose has significant impact on quantitative emphysema parameters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with severe centrilobular emphysema underwent multidetector computed tomography (120 kV, 150 mAs). Original CT raw data were simulated using 10 mAs settings (10-100 SIMmAs). Quantitative analysis provided lung volume, emphysema volume, emphysema index, mean lung density, and 4 emphysema volume classes. Simulated low-dose results were compared with original acquisition., RESULTS: Emphysema index showed no clinical relevant variation down to 30 SIMmAs. The large emphysema volume class was significantly different below 50 SIMmAs. The intermediate and small classes showed an overproportional variation below 50 SIMmAs., CONCLUSIONS: Dose reduction down to 30 SIMmAs is possible for clinical routine. Settings below 50 SIMmAs significantly alter the in-detailed 3-dimensional emphysema quantification.",Excluded
71,"The use of Gamma-irradiated proximal femoral allografts for bone stock reconstruction in complex revision hip arthroplasty. We have followed a consecutive series of 49 revision hip arthroplasties, performed for severe femoral bone loss using Gamma-irradiated anatomic-specific proximal femoral allografts longer than five centimetres. The patients were followed for a median 10.2 years, with a five year minimum follow-up. The median preoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) improved from 42 points to 77 points postoperatively. In four hips the femoral component was further revised for non-union of the allograft and aseptic failure. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were removed because of infection. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were re-revised for host step-cut fracture. Junctional-union was observed in 44/49 hips. By defining success as an increase of HHS by 20 points or more, a stable implant and no need for any subsequent re-operations related to the allograft and /or the implant, a success rate of 76% was observed. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis predicted 79% rate of survival at 10 years and 75% rate of survival at 17 years, with the need for further revision of the allograft and/or implant as the end point. Three hips underwent re-attachment of the greater trochanter for trochanteric escape. Asymptomatic non-union of the greater trochanter was noticed in another three hips. Moderate allograft resorption was observed in four hips. Two fractures of the host step-cut occurred. There were four dislocations.

OBJECTIVE: In dual-time-point PET/CT, early delayed scanning (D-1) just after the completion of whole body scanning (E) is easy to perform without additional radiation exposure and repositioning. Our aim was to assess the clinical value of D-1 compared with conventional delayed scanning (D-2)., METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Fifty-four patients with known or suspected colorectal cancer underwent (18)F-FDG PET/CT at our institution. The E scan at 1-h post-injection was followed by D-1 at 85 +/- 7 min post-injection and D-2 at 124 +/- 7 min post-injection. The clinical value of D-1 was evaluated by comparing diagnostic performance with D-2 for differentiating physiologic from pathological uptake and for staging colorectal cancer. Colonoscopic findings, histopathological results and clinical follow-up including radiological findings were used as reference standards., RESULTS: Thirty-two, eight and 73 focal or short segmental FDG foci by physiologic processes in the colon/rectum, the small intestine and the ureter, respectively, noted in the E scan were evaluated in this study. Using D-1 and D-2, 14/32 (44%) and 17/32 (53%) in the colon/rectum, 5/8 (63%) and 8/8 (100%) in the small intestine, and 55/73 (75%) and 69/73 (95%) in the ureter, respectively, were accurately interpreted as physiologic with the change of intensity and/or shape/location. A significant difference between D-1 and D-2 was observed in the ureter, but not in the bowel. The 55 colorectal cancers were finally diagnosed in 52 patients. In the staging of colorectal cancer, there were no significant differences among the three scans in the lesion-based detectability, the patient-based sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for the identification of primary tumors, nodal and hepatic metastases, and dissemination., CONCLUSIONS: Neither D-1 nor D-2 improved staging of colorectal cancer. However, delayed scans yielded information useful for differentiating physiologic uptake from pathological uptake and D-1 may provide comparable efficacy with D-2 in the bowel. Because of the ease of acquisition, the D-1 scan was considered a practical way to reduce false-positives in the abdomen and possibly helpful to avoid unnecessary additional invasive examinations, such as colonoscopy.",Excluded
1876,"Incidental pancreatic cystic lesions: comparison between CT with model-based algorithm and MRI. Introduction: The present study aims to compare low-kV CT reconstructed with MBIR technique with MRI in detecting high-risk stigmata and worrisome features in patients with pancreatic cystic lesions. Method(s): We retrospective enrolled 75 patients who underwent low-kV CT with contrast media injection for general abdominal disorders and MRI with MRCP sequences. The reviewer, blinded to clinical and histopathological data, recorded the overall number of pancreatic cystic lesions, size, location, presence of calcifications, septa, or solid enhancing or non-enhancing components, main pancreatic duct (MPD) communication, and MPD dilatation. Mean differences with 95% limits of agreement, ICC, and kappa statistics were used to compare CT and MRI. Result(s): More pancreatic cystic lesions were detected with MRI than with CT, however, the ICC value of 0.81 suggested a good agreement. According to the evaluated target lesion, a very good agreement (ICC = 0.98) was found regarding the diameter (21.4 mm CT vs 21.8 mm MRI), the location (kappa = 0.90), the detection of MPD dilatation (kappa = 1), the presence of septa (kappa = 0.86) and the MPD communication (kappa = 0.87). A moderate agreement on the assessment of enhanced components was noted (kappa = 0.44), while there was only a fair agreement about the presence of calcifications (kappa = 0.87). Conclusion(s): MDCT can be considered almost equivalent to MRI with MRCP in the evaluation of worrisome features and high-risk stigmata, offering detailed morphologic features helpful for their characterization. Implications for practice: Even if MRI is considered the reference standard in pancreatic cystic lesions characterization, CT can be considered a useful tool as a first-line imaging technique to identify worrisome features and high-risk stigmata.Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers",Excluded

778,"Electrical isolation of pulmonary veins in patients with atrial fibrillation: Reduction of fluoroscopy exposure and procedure duration by the use of a non-fluoroscopic navigation system (NavX). Aims: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of performing segmental pulmonary vein (PV) isolation guided by the NavX (Endocardial Solutions, St Jude Medical, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) system without the three-dimensional (3D) geometric reconstruction option and whether the use of NavX system will reduce the radiation exposure and procedure duration. Methods and Results: The study included 64 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent atrial fibrillation, in whom PV isolation was performed using fluoroscopic guidance (n=32) or the NavX system (n=32). Pulmonary vein mapping with a circular mapping catheter allowed the identification and localization of myocardial connections between the PV and the left atrium. PV isolation was performed by radiofrequency ablation of these connections at the atrial aspect of the PV ostium. Primary success rate for isolated PVs did not differ significantly in patients ablated under fluoroscopic guidance vs. those ablated under guidance of NavX system [100/107 PVs (93.5%) vs. 120/124 PV (96.8%; P=n.s.)]. Compared with fluoroscopy guided procedures, NavX-guided procedures showed a significant reduction in the fluoroscopy time (75.8+/-24.5 vs. 38.9+/-19.3 min, P<0.05), total X-ray exposure (93.2+/-51.6 vs. 56.6+/-37.9 Gy cm2, P=0.03), and total procedural time (237.7+/-65.4 vs. 188.6+/-62.7, P=0.01). The mean follow-up was 9.5+/-3.0 months. One patient in each group was lost to follow-up. Seven-day Holter monitoring showed that 23 of 31 patients (74.2%) in the NavX-guided group and 21 of 31 patients (67.7%) in the fluoroscopy-guided group were in sinus rhythm (P=0.57). Conclusion(s): The 3D visualization of the catheters by NavX system allows a rapid and precise visualization of the mapping and ablation catheters at the PV ostia and markedly reduces fluoroscopy time, total X-ray exposure, and procedural duration during PV isolation compared with ablation performed under fluoroscopy guidance. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",Excluded
2524,"Long-term outcomes of a phase II randomized controlled trial comparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy with or without weekly cisplatin for the treatment of locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Salvage treatment for locally recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is complicated and relatively limited. Radiotherapy, combined with effective concomitant chemotherapy, may improve clinical treatment outcomes. We conducted a phase II randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concomitant weekly cisplatin on locally recurrent NPC., METHODS: Between April 2002 and January 2008, 69 patients diagnosed with non-metastatic locally recurrent NPC were randomly assigned to either concomitant chemoradiotherapy group (n = 34) or radiotherapy alone group (n = 35). All patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The radiotherapy dose for both groups was 60 Gy in 27 fractions for 37 days (range 23-53 days). The concomitant chemotherapy schedule was cisplatin 30 mg/m(2) by intravenous infusion weekly during radiotherapy., RESULTS: The median follow-up period of all patients was 35 months (range 2-112 months). Between concomitant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, there was only significant difference in the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates (68.7% vs. 42.2%, P = 0.016 and 41.8% vs. 27.5%, P = 0.049, respectively). Subgroup analysis showed that concomitant chemoradiotherapy significantly improved the 5-year OS rate especially for patients in stage rT3-4 (33.0% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.009), stages III-IV (34.3% vs. 13.2%, P = 0.006), recurrence interval >30 months (49.0% vs. 20.6%, P = 0.017), and tumor volume >26 cm(3) (37.6% vs. 0%, P = 0.006)., CONCLUSION: Compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy can improve OS of the patients with locally recurrent NPC, especially those with advanced T category (rT3-4) and stage (III-IV) diseases, recurrence intervals >30 months, and tumor volume >26 cm(3).",Excluded

A multiinstitutional study was conducted to evaluate the technique, dose-selection parameters, and results of gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery in the management of trigeminal neuralgia. Fifty patients at five centers underwent radio-surgery performed with a single 4-mm isocenter targeted at the nerve root entry zone. Thirty-two patients had undergone prior surgery, and the mean number of procedures that had been performed was 2.8 (range 1-7). The target dose of the radiosurgery used in the current study varied from 60 to 90 Gy. The median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 18 months (range 11-36 months).

Responses remained consistent for up to 3 years postradiosurgery in all cases except three (6%) in which the patients had pain recurrence at 5, 7, and 10 months. At 2 years, 54% of patients were pain free and 88% had 50% to 100% relief. A maximum radiosurgical dose of 70 Gy or greater was associated with a significantly greater chance of complete pain relief (72% vs. 9%, p = 0.0003). Three patients (6%) developed increased facial paresthesia after radiosurgery, which resolved totally in one case and improved in another. No patient developed other deficits or deafferentation pain. The proximal trigeminal nerve and root entry zone, which is well defined on magnetic resonance imaging, is an appropriate anatomical target for radiosurgery. Radiosurgery using the gamma unit is an additional effective surgical approach for the management of medically or surgically refractory trigeminal neuralgia. A longer-term follow-up review is warranted.",Excluded
1650,"Assessing the Effect of Weight-Based Protocol Modifications to Lower Dose for CT-Guided Hepatic and Renal Tumor Radiofrequency Ablations. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed radiation dose after CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablations (RFAs) of hepatic and renal tumors and the effect of weight-based CT protocol modification for lowering overall dose in these procedures., MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT-guided RFA for renal and hepatic ablations performed from January 1, 2009, through December 31, 2009, were retrospectively reviewed (90 men and 48 women; age, 42-81 years). The radiation dose was recorded during each of the following steps: planning, performing, and postprocedure. Weight-based protocol modification changes in tube voltage and tube current were then applied to renal and hepatic ablations performed subsequently (18 men and 11 women; age, 48-82 years). Image quality, needle localization, lesion detection, ability to detect complications, and overall operator satisfaction were noted for each case (score, 1-5). Dose reduction after modification was then calculated., RESULTS: Retrospective analysis found a mean (+/- SD) overall CT dose index (CTDI) for CT-guided RFA to be 16.5 +/- 2.3 mGy. After protocol modification, the mean CTDI decreased to 6.63 +/- 0.67 mGy, a 59.6% reduction overall; for hepatic ablations, the reduction was 65.96% (p < 0.0001) and the reduction for renal ablations was 38.97% (p = 0.0153). Image quality analysis showed high operator satisfaction (3-5), including adequate needle localization (4-5), lesion visibility (3-5), and high performer confidence (4-5). Higher dose reduction was noted for patients weighing more than 180 lb (82 kg) (p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Simple weight-based CT protocol modifications can significantly reduce radiation dose during CT-guided percutaneous ablations in the liver and kidneys without significantly sacrificing image quality.",Excluded
3178,"Treatment for microcarcinoma of the thyroid - Clinical experience. AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid is a specific subgroup of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and account for up to 30% of all PTC. According to the World Health Organization, papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid (PMC) is defined as a papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring <=10 mm in the greatest dimension. The relative rate of PMC is increasing in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) mainly due to more frequent use and improvement of ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and also more accurate histopathological examination of surgical specimens. The high incidence of PMC found in autopsy studies (up to 35%) suggests that most of them have a benign behavior. The locoregional recurrence has been reported in up to 20% of PMC patients and several cases of distant metastases have also been described. The 'ideal' therapeutic approach in PMC patients remains a subject of debate among endocrinologists and surgeons. Treatment of PMC in different departments varies from partial thyroidectomy to total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment. The main question in this group of patients is ""How should PMC patients be treated?"" The aim of this study was to investigate retrospectively the frequency and clinical behavior of PMC of the thyroid gland in our department and also to identify the optimal treatment of this group of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this retrospective study, we evaluated 120 patients with PMC in our department (between 1997 and 2005). The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 43 +/- 13 years (range 17-67 years). The female to male ratio was 87.5% (105 females, 15 males). The mean follow-up period of patients in this study was 45 months (16-84 months). Surgical treatment of patients with PMC in our department consisted of a bilateral total thyroidectomy in 25 patients (21%), and a bilateral near total thyroidectomy in 95 patients (79%). In the evaluation of our patients, multifocal PMC had a relative frequency of 15% (18/120 patients). The patients were informed about the different therapeutic strategies and the possible necessity for more frequent radioiodine treatment to eliminate thyroid remnants. All of the patients in our retrospective study had radioiodine (RAI) ablation therapy for residual thyroid tissue. RESULT(S): All patients received an RAI treatment dose which ranged from 75-150 mCi (2.7-5.5 GBq). Our criteria for ablation are as follows: negative I-131 WBS and very low serum Tg levels (<1 ng/mL). In 112/120 patients (93.3%), the thyroid remnant was ablated with a single dose of I-131 75-150 mCi (2.7-5.5 GBq). A second radioiodine treatment was necessary in 8 patients (7%), because of locoregional recurrence (required mean cumulative doses of 8.2-11 GBq I-131). Locoregional reccurence occurred in 2 patients with unifocal tumor, without capsular invasion or lymph node metastases and in 6 patients with multifocal tumor and/or in patients with capsular invasion or lymph node metastases. After a second radioiodine treatment, all of these 8 patients were ablated. All 120 patients remained free from disease (negative I-131 whole body scan, unmeasurable thyroglobulin levels) after a median follow-up period of 45 months and there was no recorded disease-related mortality. CONCLUSION(S): The treatment of patients with PMC should be no different from the treatment of patients with PTC, and thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy may be a possible option for treatment of papillary microcarcinoma. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded
1047,"Targeted radionuclide therapy for patients with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG in treatment of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). METHOD(S): Twelve histologically confirmed patients with metastatic MTC were included. All patients underwent both 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging and 131I/ 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging. According to the results of the combined imaging, positive patients were selected to be treated with 90Y-DOTA-D-Phe1-Tyr3-octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) or 131I-MIBG, respectively. The therapeutic procedures of targeted internal radiation were performed with 3.33 GBq 90Y-DOTATOC at 6-week intervals, or 11.1 GBq 131I-MIBG with a minimum interval of three months. RESULT(S): The imaging procedure was positive in all 12 patients: 111In-DTPA-octreotide imaging in eight patients, 131I/ 123I-MIBG imaging in six patients. According to the results of combined imaging, we identified four patients to be treated with 90Y-DOTATOC, and five patients with 131 I-MIBG. After three to five sessions of treatment, three patients with partial remission and six with stable disease were observed. The effective rate was 3/9 (33.3%) and the overall tumor response rate was 9/9 (100%). No relevant toxicity was observed. CONCLUSION(S): The combined imaging technique can be used to identify patients for effective radionuclide treatment. The treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC or 131I-MIBG is well tolerated and may improve the fate of patients with metastatic MTC.",Excluded
464,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery. Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded
3537,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia: Clinicopathological analysis and treatment outcome of 65 cases. Objectives: To find out the demography, clinical behaviour and outcome of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) in North-west Pakistan. Study Design: Case series. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Ophthalmology, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan, from March 2011 to December 2017. Methodology: All patients with OSSN consulting this department were registered. A special proforma was designed to document demography, clinical features, management, and follow-up of all cases. At the end of study, the data was analysed using SPSS version 25 and the result compiled. Result(s): Sixty-five eyes with OSSN were included in the study, in which 40 (61.5%) were males and 25 (38.5%) were females. Mean age of the patients was 61.68 +/-12.76 years. Twenty-six (40%) patients were farmers and exposed to ultraviolet light for prolong period. Fifty-nine (90.8%) presented with a painless, reddish mass on ocular surface. Average size of neoplasm at presentation was 18.60 +/- 11.30 mm in large dimension. Histopathologically, 23 (35.4%) were carcinoma in situ and 41(63%) invasive squamous cell carcinoma. During the period of follow-up 41 (63.1%) cured, 21 (32.2%) developed recurrence, and 3 (4.6%) patients passed away. Conclusion(s): OSSN is common in North-west Pakistan. The presentation is late due to certain socio-economic factors; but overall behaviour of the neoplasm is almost the same as mentioned in other studies from different parts of the world.Copyright © 2020 College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan.

3511,"Clinical characteristics of brain metastases from lung cancer according to histological type: Pretreatment evaluation and survival following whole-brain radiotherapy. The histological type of lung cancer in patients with brain metastases may affect response to treatment and survival. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of brain metastases from lung cancer according to histological type in 70 consecutive patients with brain metastases from histologically confirmed lung cancer, who had been previously treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Histological type was divided into three categories: adenocarcinoma, small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and other non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The number, size and maximum diameter of brain metastases, the size and maximum diameter of peritumoral edema, the ratio of tumor and peritumoral edema, the asymptomatic ratio, the tumor size reduction rate, the complete response (CR) rate, the intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) and the overall survival (OS) were also evaluated. The median survival time for all patients was 26.2 weeks. Patients with SCLC exhibited a significantly smaller edema size and maximum diameter of edema compared to patients with other NSCLC (P=0.016 and 0.010, respectively). The ratio of tumor and peritumoral edema was also significantly lower in patients with SCLC compared to that in patients with adenocarcinoma and other NSCLC (P=0.001). Significant differences in intracranial PFS and OS between adenocarcinoma and other NSCLC were also observed (P=0.018 and 0.004, respectively). Patients with adenocarcinoma who were treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) following WBRT, demonstrated a significant improvement in intracranial PFS and OS (P=0.008 and 0.004, respectively). The findings presented in this study may provide useful information for the management of brain metastases. Patients with SCLC exhibit a tendency to develop peritumoral edema to a lesser extent, compared to patients with other histological tumor types. Findings in the present study suggest that patients with adenocarcinoma, particularly those treated with EGFR-TKIs, exhibit improved survival rates.",Excluded
3376,"Ultrasonographic Features of the Major Salivary Glands after Radioactive Iodine Ablation in Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic features of the major salivary glands (MSGs) after post-operative radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The study population comprised 202 consecutively registered PTC patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy, RIA and follow-up neck ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic features of the MSGs in each patient were retrospectively evaluated by a single radiologist, and the presence of post-RIA changes was determined by direct comparisons of pre- and post-RIA follow-up ultrasonographic scans. Of the 202 patients, 94 (46.5%) had post-RIA changes in the MSGs on follow-up ultrasonography. RIA dose was closely associated with the prevalence of post-RIA changes. Post-RIA changes were more common in the parotid glands (n = 93, 46.0%) than in the submandibular glands (n = 7, 3.5%). Common ultrasonographic findings representing post-RIA changes in MSGs included coarse echotexture, decreased echogenicity, lobulated margin and decreased gland size.

3524,"Optimisation of imaging technique used in direct digital radiography. The purpose of the study was to optimise the technique employed for AP shoulder and lateral cervical spine examinations following an investigation into image quality, based on clinical assessment, and effective dose, calculated from patient entrance surface dose measurements. A study was therefore conducted in an attempt to determine whether the increased radiation dose to the patient following the introduction of an anti-scatter grid was justified by the level of improvement in image quality. The study, involving 100 patients, was able to demonstrate that the increase in radiation dose to the patient when using an anti-scatter grid for AP shoulder examinations is not justified by the improved image quality. A poor level of inter-rater reliability between the consultants scoring the lateral cervical spine images prevented a firm conclusion from being reached. The fact that all images were of diagnostic quality, however, suggested that the use of the anti-scatter grid was unnecessary. Following completion of the project the hospital involved was informed of all findings. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Excluded
799,"Health status of Greek thyroid cancer patients after radioiodine administration compared to a demographically matched general population sample. The impact of radioiodine-131 (131I) treatment on thyroid cancer patients' quality of life is controversial. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 60 patients aged 18-73 years old who had recently underwent near total thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid cancer and were scheduled for 131I treatment. On admission to our department, prior to 131I administration patients underwent clinical and laboratory investigation including routine clinical biochemistry, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was estimated by the SF- 36 Health Survey a generic instrument which consisted from eight scales (four for physical and four for mental health). After 131I administration patients were discharged and approximately 6 months later they were re-evaluated. Our results showed that HRQoL in thyroid cancer patients receiving 131I treatment is independent of age/ gender and thyroid cancer-related variables. All SF-36 scales significantly improved six months after administration (P<0.05). Compared to Greek general population, before 131I administration all scales were significantly lower (P<0.05). Six months post 131I administration, scales were significantly lower for physical functioning (P=0.02), physical role (P=0.01), social functioning (P=0.03) and emotional role limitations (P=0.04), whereas the remaining SF-36 scales were comparable to the general population. In conclusion, hypothyroidism and anxiety for the outcome of their disease before 131I treatment exert a negative impact on thyroid cancer patients. Quality of life improvement post 131I is mainly attributed to the resumption of euthyroidism and familiarization with treatment and follow-up procedures rather than 131I treatment itself. There was no significant difference between patients receiving lower (2220-3700MBq) and higher (3700-7400MBq) dosage.",Excluded
3026,"Safety and Feasibility of Performing Fenestrated Endovascular Abdominal Aneurysm Repair Using a Portable C-arm Without Fusion Technology: A Single-Center Experience. Objective Most centers performing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) use hybrid rooms with fusion technology for mapping. We present our experience of successfully performing F-EVAR using C-arm without fusion technology. Methods During the period of January 2016 to October 2018, data were collected from a prospectively maintained F-EVAR database at our tertiary care institute. The primary endpoint was technical success, and the secondary outcomes measured were short- and midterm clinical success (both defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards), blood loss, radiation dose, operative time, postoperative endoleaks, aneurysm rupture, endograft patency, and complications. Results We performed 11 F-EVARs during the study period in five (45.5%) males and six (54.5%) females, with a mean age of 75+8 years. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C-arm (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) without the use of fusion technology. Three patients had planned preoperative open procedures for access due to prior cutdown or bypass. Technical success was achieved in all 11 (100%) cases. The mean length of stay was 5+2 days, and the mean follow-up was 7.5+6.5 months. The mean procedure time was 301+167 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 361+233 mL. Mean fluoroscopy time was 72+31 minutes, and the mean radiation exposure time was 2,160+930 mGy. No patients required intraoperative transfusion. Thirty-day (short term) clinical success was achieved in 10 (90.0%), cases whereas six-month (midterm) clinical success was achieved in 7 (77.7%) patients. Branch vessel patency was 11 (100%) at 30 days and 9 (81.8%) at six months, and primary endograft patency was 100% (11) at six months. We had no perioperative mortality or major adverse cardiac event at 30 days. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity included readmission for pulmonary edema from cardiac failure in one patient. Two patients had clinically insignificant silent cardiac enzyme elevation. Three patients had re-interventions performed during the mean follow-up period. Two patients developed renal stent thrombosis resulting in renal insufficiency, which is defined as an increase in creatinine concentration >=0.5 mg/dL, without the need for dialysis. One type II endoleak was identified postoperatively that required trans-lumbar embolization. No type I or III endoleaks were identified during the study period. Asymptomatic common femoral artery thrombosis was seen on follow-up imaging in one patient. Conclusions We conclude that F-EVAR can be safely performed using C-arm without the use of fusion technology.

PURPOSE: The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer and good prognostic factors has become combined chemotherapy (ChT) and radiotherapy (RT). However, the sequencing of the two modalities, as well as fractionation of RT, has been controversial. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Study 92-04 was a randomized Phase II study designed to evaluate further the toxicity and efficacy of 2 different strategies of chemoradiation evaluated in 2 prior RTOG Phase II studies., METHODS: Patients with Stage II or III medically inoperable or unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, good performance status, and minimal weight loss were enrolled into a prospective randomized Phase II RTOG study. Arm 1 consisted of induction ChT (vinblastine 5 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus weekly for the first 5 weeks, and cisplatin, 100 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 29) followed by concurrent ChT/RT (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 50, 71, and 92) during thoracic radiotherapy (63 Gy in 34 fractions during 7 weeks starting on Day 50). Arm 2 was concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT starting on Day 1 with a total dose of 69.6 Gy in 58 fractions during 6 weeks, 1.2 Gy/fraction b.i.d. ChT consisted of cisplatin, 50 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8, and oral VP-16, 50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days only on the days of thoracic radiotherapy repeated on Day 29., RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were entered between 1992 and 1994, and 163 patients were eligible for analysis. Eighty-one patients were treated in Arm 1 and 82 patients in Arm 2. Pretreatment characteristics, including age, gender, Karnofsky performance status, histologic features, and stage, were similar. The incidence of acute esophagitis was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 2 than among those treated in Arm 1 (p <0.0001). The incidence of acute hematologic toxicity was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 1 (p = 0.01 for anemia and p = 0.03 for other hematologic toxicities) than among those treated in Arm 2. Analysis of late toxicity showed that chronic esophageal toxicity was significantly more frequent in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 (p = 0.003).

2242,"Risk factors and clinical courses of chemoradiation-related arterio-esophageal fistula in esophageal cancer patients with clinical invasion of the aorta. Background: Although concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for esophageal cancer invading adjacent structures (T4-EC), arterio-esophageal fistula (AEF) occurs occasionally as a critical adverse event of T4-EC with CRT. The frequency, clinical course, and risk factors of AEF related to CRT are not well known. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed 48 patients with T4-EC invasion of the aorta who were treated with 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy at our institution between September 2002 and April 2009. Treatment-related AEF was defined as AEF without obvious tumor progression. We evaluated the frequency, clinical courses, and risk factors of AEF. Result(s): The median survival time was 10.6 months with a median follow-up time of 33.3 months. The 2-year survival rate was 25%. Treatment-related AEF was observed in 7 patients (14.6%) and 4 of them died of massive bleeding due to aortic AEF. In the other 3 patients with non-aortic AEF, hemorrhage could be arrested by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE). In the univariate analysis of risk factors for AEF, lower serum cholesterol level was a risk factor for AEF (OR 14.7; 95% CI 1.58-137; P = 0.008). Conclusion(s): Although CRT has a curative potential even for patients with T4-EC invading the aorta, we should be aware of the relatively high incidence of treatment-related AEF. TAE may be successful in rescuing a non-aortic AEF patient. Low serum cholesterol level may be a risk factor for AEF, but further investigation is needed. © 2011 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

Mean coronary artery attenuation did not differ significantly between the two groups (386 +/- 102 HU vs 385 +/- 64 HU; p not significant). Without BMI adaptation, coronary attenuation correlated strongly with BMI (r = -0.63; p < 0.001). With the BMI-adapted protocol, however, there was no correlation between BMI and coronary attenuation (r = -0.24; p not significant)., CONCLUSION: We validated a BMI-adapted contrast material protocol that results in adequate coronary vessel attenuation independent of individual BMI despite a significant reduction in overall amount of contrast material used.",Excluded

2098,"Multivariable normal-tissue complication modeling of acute esophageal toxicity in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated (chemo-)radiotherapy. Background and purpose The majority of normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP) models for acute esophageal toxicity (AET) in advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (AS-NSCLC) patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy are based on three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT). Due to distinct dosimetric characteristics of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3D-CRT based models need revision. We established a multivariable NTCP model for AET in 149 AS-NSCLC patients undergoing IMRT. Materials and methods An established model selection procedure was used to develop an NTCP model for Grade >=2 AET (53 patients) including clinical and esophageal dose-volume histogram parameters. Results The NTCP model predicted an increased risk of Grade >=2 AET in case of: concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCR) [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 14.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.70-42.19; p < 0.001], increasing mean esophageal dose [Dmean; OR 1.12 per Gy increase, 95% CI 1.06-1.19; p < 0.001], female patients (OR 3.33, 95% CI 1.36-8.17; p = 0.008), and >=cT3 (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.12-6.50; p = 0.026). The AUC was 0.82 and the model showed good calibration. Conclusions A multivariable NTCP model including CCR, Dmean, clinical tumor stage and gender predicts Grade >=2 AET after IMRT for AS-NSCLC. Prior to clinical introduction, the model needs validation in an independent patient cohort.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2367,"EGFR-amplification plus gene expression profiling predicts response to combined radiotherapy with EGFR-inhibition: A preclinical trial in 10 HNSCC-tumour-xenograft models. Background and purpose Improvement of the results of radiotherapy by EGFR inhibitors is modest, suggesting significant intertumoural heterogeneity of response. To identify potential biomarkers, a preclinical trial was performed on ten different human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts of the head and neck (HNSCC) studying in vivo and ex vivo the effect of fractionated irradiation and EGFR inhibition. Local tumour control and tumour growth delay were correlated with potential biomarkers, e.g. EGFR gene amplification and radioresponse-associated gene expression profiles. Material and methods Local tumour control 120 days after end of irradiation was determined for fractionated radiotherapy alone (30 f, 6 weeks) or after simultaneous EGFR-inhibition with cetuximab. The EGFR gene amplification status was determined using FISH. Gene expression analyses were performed using an in-house gene panel. Results Six out of 10 investigated tumour models showed a significant increase in local tumour control for the combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy compared to irradiation alone. For 3 of the 6 responding tumour models, an amplification of the EGFR gene could be demonstrated. Gene expression profiling of untreated tumours revealed significant differences between amplified and non-amplified tumours as well as between responder and non-responder tumours to combined radiotherapy and cetuximab. Conclusion The EGFR amplification status, in combination with gene expression profiling, may serve as a predictive biomarker for personalized interventional strategies regarding combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy and should, as a next step, be clinically validated.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1428,"Noise reduction technology reduces radiation dose in chronic total occlusions percutaneous coronary intervention: a propensity score-matched analysis. Chronic total occlusions (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with high radiation dose. Our study aim was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of a noise reduction technology (NRT) on patient radiation dose during CTO PCI. A total of 187 CTO PCIs performed between February 2016 and May 2017 were analyzed according to the angiographic systems utilized: Standard (n = 60) versus NRT (n = 127). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to control for differences in baseline characteristics. Primary endpoints were Cumulative Air Kerma at Interventional Reference Point (AK at IRP), which correlates with patient's tissue reactions; and Kerma Area Product (KAP), a surrogate measure of patient's risk of stochastic radiation effects. An Efficiency Index (defined as fluoroscopy time/AK at IRP) was calculated for each procedure. Image quality was evaluated using a 5-grade Likert-like scale. After PSM, n = 55 pairs were identified. Baseline and angiographic characteristics were well matched between groups. Compared to the Standard system, NRT was associated with lower AK at IRP [2.38 (1.80-3.66) vs. 3.24 (2.04-5.09) Gy, p = 0.035], a trend towards reduction for KAP [161 (93-244) vs. 203 (136-363) Gycm2, p = 0.069], and a better Efficiency Index [16.75 (12.73-26.27) vs. 13.58 (9.92-17.63) min/Gy, p = 0.003]. Image quality was similar between the two groups (4.39 +/- 0.53 Standard vs. 4.34 +/- 0.47 NRT, p = 0.571). In conclusion, compared with a Standard system, the use of NRT in CTO PCI is associated with lower patient radiation dose and similar image quality.",Excluded
1406,"Minimally Invasive Stereotactical Radio-ablation of Adrenal Metastases as an Alternative to Surgery. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to study the clinical outcome for patients with metastases of the adrenal gland treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients were studied retrospectively. The dose prescription was 40 Gy in four fractions. Dosimetric analysis was performed using the dose volume histograms while clinical outcome was assessed using actuarial analysis with determination of the overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) rates., RESULTS: The planning objectives were met for all patients. With a median follow-up period of 7.6 months, at the last follow-up 42 patients (91.3%) were alive and four had died because of distant progression. The actuarial mean OS was 28.5+/-1.6 months, the median was not reached. One-year and 2-year OS were 87.6+/-6.1%. None of the risk factors was significant in univariate analysis. Actuarial mean LC was 14.6+/-1.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.0 to 18.2) and median LC was 14.5+/-2.0 months (95% CI, 10.5 to 18.5). One-year and 2-year LC were 65.5+/-11.9% and 40.7+/-15.8%, respectively. A mild profile of toxicity was observed in the cohort of patients. Forty patients (86.9%) showed no complication (grade 0); two patients reported asthenia, six patients (13.1%) reported either pain, nausea, or vomiting. Of these six patients, five patients (10.9%) were scored as grade 1 toxicity while one patient (2.2%) was scored as grade 2., CONCLUSION: Stereotactic body radiation therapy treatment provided an adequate clinical response in the management of adrenal gland metastases.",Excluded
227,"A comparison of the semiflexed (MTP) view with the standing extended view (SEV) in the radiographic assessment of knee osteoarthritis in a busy routine X-ray department. Objective. To compare the reproducibility of the standing extended view (SEV) (also known as the standing anteroposterior view) with the semiflexed, postero-anterior view [the 'metatarsophalangeal' (MTP)] view for assessing joint space width (JSW) and osteophytes in osteoarthritis of the knee when used in a busy routine X-ray department. Methods. Forty-seven patients (24 men) had both SEV and MTP views taken on the same day in a busy National Health Service radiography department. Repeat views were taken as entirely separate procedures some time over the following 2 weeks, in the same department and with no special arrangements for the selection of radiographers, time of day, or X-ray machine. The first 24 patients had second views in the SEV position whilst the remaining 23 had second MTP views. Radiographs were read independently by two experienced observers who measured JSW with a transparent ruler to the nearest 0.5 mm at the narrowest point in both medial and lateral compartments of the tibiofemoral joint in both knees. Osteophytes were graded 0-2 according to a standard atlas. Ten SEV and 10 MTP radiographs selected randomly were re-read by one observer. Results. Mean (95% confidence interval) JSW in the medial compartment measured on SEV radiographs was 3.54 mm (3.08, 3.99) and on MTP radiographs it was 2.80 mm (2.37, 3.23); in the lateral compartment it was 6.04 mm (5.71, 6.37) when measured on SEV radiographs and 5.47 mm (5.09, 5.85) on MTP radiographs. The estimated variances for the medial compartment were 2.0 mm2 for SEV and 0.2 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001) and for the lateral compartment 1.4 mm2 for SEV and 0.5 mm2 for MTP (P < 0.001). The proportion of radiographs for which there was disagreement between observers regarding osteophyte grade was not statistically different between SEV and MTP views (SEV, medial 40%, lateral 44%; MTP, medial 39%, lateral 39%). Conclusions. Even when radiographs are taken in a busy National Health Service radiography department, measurement of JSW from the MTP view is more reproducible than from the SEV view, the MTP view gives a slightly lower measurement of JSW, and there is no advantage in using either view in recording osteophyte grade. We recommend the wider adoption of the MTP method. © British Society for Rheumatology 2004; all rights reserved.",Excluded
2664,"Determinants of vitamin D status in long-term renal transplant patients. In this study, we explored the determinants of vitamin D status in a large cohort of stable, Long-term renal transplant (RTx) patients. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and bone biochemistry parameters, were retrospectively analyzed from 266 RTx patients (>10 yr post-engraftment) presenting to clinic over the course of a year. Forty-five percent of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<37.5 nM), 38% insufficient (37.5 75-nM), and 17% sufficient (>75 nM). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in patients presenting in summer (p<0.001) and in more active patients (p<0.05). RTx patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n=45) had higher 25(OH)D concentrations than patients without NMSC (n=221; p<0.05) despite these patients being older, having worse eGFR, transplanted for longer, and less active physically (p<0.05). Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with higher PTH concentrations (p<0.05) which, in the setting of widespread hypovitaminosis, suggests that secondary hyperparathyroidism was common in this cohort. In conclusion, season and activity status are important determinants of vitamin D status. We report, for the first time, that NMSC is associated with higher 25(OH)D, probably through increased UV radiation exposure. Long-term RTx patients may benefit from oral vitamin D supplementation, but this requires a randomized controlled trial to confirm. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
2445,"Changes in tumor oxygenation during combined treatment with split- course radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. Purpose: To evaluate the changes in tumor oxygenation during definitive split-course radiochemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer (lymph nodes and primaries). Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-four patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were investigated pretherapeutically and during a defined course of radiochemotherapy (RCTh) with a total dose of 70 Gy given in 35 fractions over 9 weeks (2-week break after 30 Gy). In weeks 1 and 6, the patients received chemotherapy (5 FU and mitomycin C) concomitant with irradiation. The oxygen partial pressure measurements were carried out using polarographic needle probes in combination with a microprocessor-controlled device (pO2 histograph/KIMOC). Times of measurements were before therapy, at the end of week 3 (30 Gy), after a 2- week break (30 Gy) and at the end of therapy if measurable lesion was found (70 Gy). Result(s): There was a significant reduction in the median pO2 (P < 0.005, n = 18) and an increase in the hypoxic fraction (defined as the percentage of pO2 values of <5 mm Hg) after application of 30 Gy (P < 0.05, n = 18). This effect was partially reversed at the end of the 2-week break. During the break an increase in the median pO2 (P = 0.05, n = 12) and a decrease in the hypoxic fraction could be observed. Towards the end of therapy (70 Gy) a significant decrease (P = 0.02, n = 13) in the median pO2 occurred. Corresponding to this, the hypoxic fraction increased during the last 4 weeks of therapy (P = 0.06, n = 13). Conclusion(s): Statistically significant changes in oxygenation in locally advanced head and neck cancer were found during a split-course radiochemotherapy. This information was obtained in a homogenous group of patients under well-defined therapeutic conditions. The decrease in the tumor oxygenation status at doses of 30 and 70 Gy are important findings because they are in contrast to the concept of continuous improvement of the oxygenation status during fractionated radiotherapy.",Excluded

388,"Analysis of entrance surface dose in general radiographies using body mass index classification. Dose audit is an important topic in radiology and variations in dose attributable to sex have not been fully investigated. The primary purpose of our study was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) for men and women, from which we established an easy estimation equation for ESD, using the body mass index (BMI) as a variable. From April 2000 to March 2002, 15424 patients (8586 men, 6838 women; mean age, 58 years old; age range, 20 to 90 years old) were recruited in this study. Estimated equation of ESD was obtained from the dispersion data of BMI and ESD. Welch's t-test was used as the test of significance. P values evaluated levels of significance at 5%. Analysis for correlation coefficients was used for Peason's correlation coefficient test. And, we also performed a simple regression analysis. The results of the simple regression equation with BMI as variable (y: ESD [mGy], x: BMI [kg/m(2)), and the median values of ESD were as follows: for chest PA, men, 0.22, y = 0.0145 x - 0.0876, women, 0.20, y = 0.0126 x - 0.0704; for abdomen AP, men, 2.12, y = 0.2707 x - 3.7206, women, 1.65, y = 0.2561 x - 3.7989; for pelvis AP, men, 1.87, y = 0.0517 x + 0.8753, women, 1.77, y = 0.0674 x + 0.4775; for lumbar spine AP, men, 3.08, y = 0.3462 x - 4.1416, women, 2.66, y = 0.2525 x - 2.8131; and for lumbar spine lateral, men, 9.31, y = 0.6012 x - 3.7216, women, 7.42, y = 0.3147 x + 0.3384.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the value of an ultra-low-dose CT protocol (ULD-CT) in the dectection of lungnodules in follow-up of cancer patients., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between April and August 2003, 72 consecutive patients with a history of malignancy were prospectively examined on a single-slice helical CT scanner (Aquilion, Toshiba) with ULD-CT (120 kV, 5 mAs, D-eff 0.12 mSv) and regular-dose CT (R-CT) (120 kV, 150 mAs, D-eff 4.8 mSv). The ULD-CT examinations were independently evaluated by two radiologists. Afterwards, consensus reading of the ULD-CT and R-CT examinations was done. Individual nodules were classified benign (benign calcifications) and non-benign. The studies were classified in 4 subgroups: 1) non-benign nodule evident; 2) non-benign nodule probable; 3) non-benign nodule possible, but not likely; 4) no-non benign nodule., RESULTS: ULD-CT detected 180 nodules in 47 patients, while R-CT showed 168 nodules in 39 patients. The sensitivity of ULD-CT was 87 % in detecting nodules regardless of size and 94 % in detecting nodules > or = 5 mm. Regarding the prediction of a case with non-benign nodules (subgroups 1 to 3), the sensitivity of ULD-CT was 94 % and the specificity 75 %., CONCLUSION: ULD-CT is a good diagnostic tool in detecting lung nodules > or = 5 mm. Radiation dose can be markedly reduced. A negative ULD-CT study excludes non-benign nodules in R-CT with a high probability. In case of a positive ULD-CT, R-CT can be immediately followed.",Excluded

Background: Contaminated textiles in hospitals contribute to endogenous, indirect-contact, and aerosol transmission of nosocomial related pathogens. Copper oxide impregnated linens have wide-spectrum antimicrobial, antifungal, and antiviral properties. Our aim was to determine if replacing non-biocidal linens with biocidal copper oxide impregnated linens would reduce the rates of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in a long-term care ward. Method(s): We compared the rates of HAI in two analogous patient cohorts in a head injury care ward over two 6-month parallel periods before (period A) and after (period B) replacing all the regular non-biocidal linens and personnel uniforms with copper oxide impregnated biocidal products. Result(s): During period B, in comparison to period A, there was a 24% reduction in the HAI per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.05), a 47% reduction in the number of fever days (>38.5. degreeC) per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.01), and a 32.8% reduction in total number of days of antibiotic administration per 1000 hospitalization-days (p< 0.0001).

Contrast investigations of hysterosalpingography (HSG) and retrograde urethrography (RUG) fluoroscopy procedures remain the dominant diagnostic tools for the investigation of infertility in females and urethral strictures in males, respectively, owing to the scarcity and high cost of services of alternative diagnostic technologies. In light of the radiological risks associated with contrast based investigations of the genitourinary tract systems, there is a need to assess the magnitude of radiation burden imparted to patients undergoing HSG and RUG fluoroscopy procedures in Tanzania. The air kerma area product (KAP), fluoroscopy time, number of images, organ dose and effective dose to patients undergoing HSG and RUG procedures were obtained from four hospitals. The KAP was measured using a flat transmission ionization chamber, while the organ and effective doses were estimated using the knowledge of the patient characteristics, patient related exposure parameters, geometry of examination, KAP and Monte Carlo calculations (PCXMC). The median values of KAP for the HSG and RUG were 2.2 Gy cm2 and 3.3 Gy cm2, respectively. The median organ doses in the present study for the ovaries, urinary bladder and uterus for the HSG procedures, were 1.0 mGy, 4.0 mGy and 1.6 mGy, respectively, while for urinary bladder and testes of the RUG were 3.4 mGy and 5.9 mGy, respectively. The median values of effective doses for the HSG and RUG procedures were 0.65 mSv and 0.59 mSv, respectively. The median values of effective dose per hospital for the HSG and RUG procedures had a range of 1.6-2.8 mSv and 1.9-5.6 mSv, respectively, while the overall differences between individual effective doses across the four hospitals varied by factors of up to 22.0 and 46.7, respectively for the HSG and RUG procedures. The proposed diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) for the HSG and RUG were for KAP 2.8 Gy cm2 and 3.9 Gy cm2, for fluoroscopy time 0.8 min and 0.9 min, and for number of images 5 and 4, respectively. The suggested DRLs for the HSG and RUG procedures may be used by the radiology departments in Tanzania for management of attained dose levels until the national DRLs are established.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2026,"Safety and efficacy of a novel high-intensity focused electromagnetic technology device for noninvasive abdominal body shaping. BACKGROUND: Thermal fat reduction technologies are leading the market for nonsurgical abdominal contouring. However, they are ideal principally for patients with fat bulges., OBJECTIVES: Our study investigates the effects of a novel nonthermal technology affecting the abdominal musculature and subcutaneous adipose tissue., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 22 patients (avg. BMI 23.8 kg m-2 ) underwent 4 treatments on abdomen with high-intensity focused electromagnetic (HIFEM) field device. Treatments took 30 minutes and were spaced apart by 2-3 days. Photographs, weight, and waist measurements were taken at the baseline, after the last treatment, and at month 3 follow-up. Patient satisfaction was noted. Photographs were evaluated by blinded evaluators., RESULTS: The study protocol was completed by 19 patients. At month 3, the average waist size reduction was 4.37 +/- 2.63 cm (P < 0.01). The evaluators identified the before image from the 3-month image 89.47% of the time. About 91% of patients reported their abdominal appearance improved, and 92% stated they are satisfied with treatment results at month 3. No adverse events occurred., CONCLUSION: Observed waist size reduction and aesthetic improvement appear to be a combination of fat reduction and increased muscle definition of abdominal wall. In lower BMI patients, the increased abdominal muscle definition was largely responsible for the improvement. This novel energy device provides an additional tool for body contouring with primary application for lower and medium BMI patients.

605,"Differentiation of functionally active mouse T lymphocytes from functionally inactive bone marrow precursors II. Limited recovery of T-cell responses from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture. The limited differentiation of mature T cell function from mouse bone marrow in tissue culture is described and compared with similar differentiation occuring in vivo in irradiated bone marrow protected mice. Data are presented to show that a pool of precursors, similar in size to that able to produce early (transient?) regeneration in thymectomized recipients, is responsible for the development of mitogen responsive T cells active in MLC (proliferation) and CML (development of cytotoxic cells) assays. In contrast, a helper cell population which augments antibody formation from T-depleted normal spleen cells derives from a pool of similar precursors yet does not seem to be theta positive. Similarly, larger cells (perhaps typical of those giving rise to suppressor T cells in vivo) give rise to a suppressor cell pool after 4 days of culture, though again only a fraction of this suppressor activity could be attributed to theta positive cells. It is suggested that much of the data for regenration of T lymphocytes in vitro from T-depleted sources needs to be re-interpreted in terms of this evidence for a pool of post-thymic precursors of T cells in such T-deficient cell populations.",Excluded

INTRODUCTION: Complete esophageal obstruction leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses as an alternative to surgery that has high morbid-mortality. AIMS & METHODS: This is a case series report about six patients referred for complete esophageal disruption classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (> 5cm), one after caustic ingestion and two due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal. Two had an associated loss of the SES; 2/ Short disruption (< 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy for a neck neoplasia. They had been fasting for 3 to 18 months. All the procedures were performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, under anesthesia and with CO2 insufflation and X-rays guidance. RESULT(S): There were 3 men and women between 25 and 71 years old. All the reconstructions have been successful in one to three endoscopic sessions, using the non hydrophilic tip of a guide wire passed through a straight catheter in 5 cases and a EUS needle in only one case. In 2 cases, a neo-SES had to be created, by transillumination (n=1) or head and neck surgery (n=1). In order to guide the reconstruction, SEMS was used in one case, NGT in one case, and both were used in one patient. The first dilation was performed with a CRE balloon (12-15mm). All the patients could eat mixed after 2 POD. There was no intraoperative or post-operative complication. Then, the patients underwent 3 to 18 dilations sessions during 1.5 to 15 months; two are still undergoing dilations and all eat normally. CONCLUSION(S): Endoscopic rendez-vous for esophageal reconstruction is safe and effective in case of esophageal disruption even with loss of SES, avoiding surgery.",Excluded

Purpose: To perform a Phase I study of preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) with S-1, a novel oral fluoropyrimidine, plus oxaliplatin in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended dose. Methods and Materials: Radiotherapy was delivered to a total of 45 Gy in 25 fractions and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a fixed dose of oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2/week) on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and escalated doses of S-1 on Days 1-14 and 22-35. The initial dose of S-1 was 50 mg/m2/day, gradually increasing to 60, 70, and 80 mg/m2/day. Surgery was performed within 6 +/- 2 weeks. Result(s): Twelve patients were enrolled and tolerated up to Dose Level 4 (3 patients at each dose level) without dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 3 patients were enrolled at Dose Level 4, with 1 experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 diarrhea. Although maximum tolerated dose was not attained, Dose Level 4 (S-1 80 mg/m 2/day) was chosen as the recommended dose for further Phase II studies. No Grade 4 toxicity was observed, and Grade 3 toxicities of leukopenia and diarrhea occurred in the same patient (1 of 15, 6.7%). Pathologic complete responses were observed in 2 of 15 patients (13.3%). Conclusion(s): The recommended dose of S-1 was determined to be 80 mg/m2/day when combined with oxaliplatin in preoperative CRT, and a Phase II trial is now ongoing.

BACKGROUND: The association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the risk of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) is controversial. In this study we re-examined a previously reported association between the use of proton pump inhibitors and the development of community-acquired CDAD, this time using an alternative case definition of the disease., METHODS: We performed a case-control study of community-acquired CDAD using a United Kingdom clinical research database. Patients receiving oral vancomycin therapy were identified as having CDAD, the only indication for this drug. Each case subject was matched with up to 10 control subjects. Neither the cases nor the controls had been admitted to hospital in the year before the date of the vancomycin prescription (index date). Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for key covariates., RESULTS: We identified 317 cases of community-acquired CDAD treated with oral vancomycin therapy and 3167 matched control subjects. Exposure to a proton pump inhibitor in the 90 days before the index date was associated with an increased risk of CDAD (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3-5.2). Antibiotic exposure in the 90 days before the index date was also a significant risk factor for community-acquired CDAD (OR 8.2, 95% CI 6.1- 11.0), even though 45% of the case subjects had not received a prescription for an antibiotic during that period. Certain comorbidities, in particular renal failure, inflammatory bowel disease and malignant disease, as well as prior methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, were also associated with an increased risk., INTERPRETATION: Proton pump inhibitor use was associated with an increased risk of community-acquired CDAD, when cases were defined by receipt of prescription for oral vancomycin therapy. Prior antibiotic exposure was also a significant risk factor, but a significant proportion of the patients with community-acquired CDAD had no such exposure.",Excluded
1714,"Complete histopathological regression in rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgical treatment. Background/Aim. Multimodal approach to locally advanced rectal cancer treatment results in better disease outcome. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy improves disease local control, reduces risk of local recurrence and in the majority of patients with complete or substantial regression of the tumors significantly improves survival rates. According to the literature data, approximately 20% of patients had achieved complete histopathological response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall survival in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and sphincter preserving surgery. Methods. This retrospective study included 191 patients. Patients received preoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy-chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by operation that favorized sphincter preservation with total mesorectal excision (TME) from June 2000 until December 2010. Diagnosis was established according to the following algorithm: patient history, digital rectal examiantion, colonoscopy with biopsy and histopathology verification, and preoperative clinical staging. Patients with tumors located below promontorium were included in the study and patients with metastatic disease and local recurrence were excluded from the study. For tumors located below the promontorium preoperative radiotherapy was used with total dose of 50.4 Gy, divided into daily doses of 1.8 Gy, during 28 days. Chemotherapy followed radiotherapy with 5- fluorouracil and folic acid (Leucovorin) on days 1, 2, 10, 11, 20 and 21. Six to ten weeks after neoadjuvant therapy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to restage tumors and operation were performed. Results. Of all patients that received preopertive chemoradiation, 163 had radical sphincter preservig surgery and 28 patients had paliative operations. Histopathological examination of the specimens showed that the complete histopathological regression was achieved in 21.4% of the patients, downstaged was found in 63.2% of them and unchanged stage was found in 15.3% of the patients. The five-year survival rate was 63.3% and 50.5 % in the patients with pCR and patients with incomplete histopathological regression, respectively. Survival rates between two groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusion. The preoperative chemoradiotherapy is very important in achieving optimal clinical care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.Copyright © 2018, Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

271,"Low contrast and radiation dose coronary CT angiography using a 320-row system and a refined contrast injection and timing method. BACKGROUND: Among CT scanners, 320-row instruments feature decreased photon energy and yield strong contrast enhancement. Consequently, the contrast medium (CM) dose can be reduced. The results of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on 320-row scanners have not been adequately assessed., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of a low-contrast-dose protocol on the image quality of CCTA using 80 kVp tube voltage, iterative reconstruction (IR), and a 320-row scanner., METHODS: We randomly assigned 90 patients (mean body weight, 56.5 +/- 11.0 kg) to 1 of 3 CCTA protocols. Under protocol A, 30 were scanned using a conventional 120-kVp protocol and a standard CM dose (280 mg iodine/kg body weight [mgI/kg]). Another 30 underwent scanning at 80 kVp with a 25% CM dose reduction (210 mgI/kg; protocol B). Under protocol C, the remaining 30 patients were scanned at 80 kVp with a 50% CM dose reduction (140 mgI/kg). The 120 and 80 kVp images were processed with IR. Images obtained under the 3 protocols were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis., RESULTS: The amount of CM used in protocol A, B, and C was 43.6 +/- 10.1, 30.3 +/- 4.4, and 21.0 +/- 4.0 mL, respectively. Mean CT attenuation of the coronary arteries tended to be higher under protocol B than the other 2 protocols. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher under protocol B. The mean visual scores were significantly higher for protocols A and B than protocol C. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under the 80-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: With a 320-row scanner and our refined CM injection and timing protocol, it is technically feasible to obtain sufficient vascular enhancement with a reduction in the CM and/or radiation dose at 80-kVp CCTA with IR.
