885,"3D Printed Personalized Guide Plate in the Femoral Head Core Decompression Objective. To investigate the feasibility of using 3D printed personalized guide plates in core decompression procedures for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). Methods. The clinical data of 8 patients undergoing femoral head core decompression from January to December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively. Three-dimensional (3D) images of the patients were reconstructed from the CT scan data taken preoperatively. From the data obtained, puncture position, drill hole, and depth were evaluated, and individualized 3D puncture guide plates were designed using Mimics 21.0 software. During the operation, the needle went through the hole of the guide plate, the depth of the drill was controlled, and the obtained bone tissues were sent for pathological evaluation. Intraoperative X-ray and postoperative pathological results were used to evaluate the success of the puncture. Results. The individualized guide plates used for core compression on the 8 patients were well fitted with the anatomic structure of the puncture site, and the direction and depth of the needle insertion were consistent with the preoperative design. The operation time was about 15-22 mins. The position of the decompression tunnel was the same as the designed plate. The postoperative pathology showed necrotic bone tissue. There were no postoperative complications such as infection, bleeding, and fracture. Conclusion. The 3D printed individualized guide plate can simplify core decompression and would make this procedure more accurate, safe, and quick, in addition to obtaining necrotic tissues for pathological examination.Copyright © 2020 Liangliang Cheng et al.",Excluded
1722,"Salvage high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for locally recurrent rectal cancer: Long-term follow-up results Background: We retrospectively examined outcomes of salvage high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy (HDR-ISBT) for locally recurrent rectal cancer (LRRC). Method(s): Nine patients with LRRC were treated with salvage HDR-ISBT. Their median age was 63 years. The median maximum diameter of LRRC was 40 mm (range 20-80 mm). Adenocarcinomas were histologically confirmed in all cases. The prescribed dose was 30 Gy/5 fractions/3 days to 50 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the combined external-beam radiotherapy group (four patients) and 54 Gy/9 fractions/5 days to 60 Gy/10 fractions/6 days in the monotherapeutic group (five patients). Median follow-up time was 90 months (range 6-221 months). Result(s): Local control at final follow-up was achieved in five of nine patients. Of these five patients, one experienced a locally re-recurrent tumor in the vaginal wall 33 months after treatment and received re-HDR-ISBT as re-salvage treatment. The 8-year overall survival, local control, and progression-free survival rates were 56, 44, and 33 %, respectively. Based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ver. 4.03, the following Grade 3 adverse events were observed in three patients (>=3 months): Grade 3 skin ulceration in one patient who showed tumor invasion of the skin and whose V100 was 400 cc; Grade 3 vaginal perforation in one patient whose tumor had invaded the vaginal wall; and Grade 3 vagina-to-bladder fistula in one patient whose tumor received re-irradiation. Late adverse events above Grade 3 were not observed. Conclusion(s): Long-term follow-up results revealed that salvage HDR-ISBT is a promising treatment for LRRC with tolerable toxicity. © 2013 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded
2469,"Predictive value of secondary signs of obstruction in follow-up computed tomography of ureteral stones: a study with dynamic computed tomography OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the ratio of obstruction and predictive values of secondary signs in follow-up computed tomography (CT) of ureterolithiasis patients; to correlate stone characteristics with obstruction; to compare enhancement of obstructed and non-obstructed kidneys; and to compare radiation dose of the dynamic CT protocol to an excretory-phase protocol., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 49 follow-up CT scans of patients with remaining ureterolithiasis after a renal colic episode. Obstruction was measured as time taken to excretion of contrast medium in dynamic CT. Degree of secondary signs of obstruction was evaluated from the unenhanced CT. Data were collected on patients' gender and age, stone size and location, time from renal colic to follow-up, attenuation of the renal cortex and radiation dose., RESULTS: Obstruction was present in 28% (n = 14) at follow-up. Predictive values (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) were calculated for hydronephrosis (1.0, 0.63, 0.52, 1.0), hydroureter (1.0, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0), perirenal stranding (0.21, 0.94, 0.6, 0.75), Gerota's fascia (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76) and renal swelling (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76). Obstruction was not correlated with stone characteristics. Enhancement was lower in obstructed kidneys (p < 0.01). Radiation dose was reduced by 43% (1.8 mSv)., CONCLUSIONS: Obstruction was found in 28% of patients. Secondary signs were scarce and of indeterminate value to the diagnosis of obstruction. The absence of hydronephrosis and hydroureter contradicted obstruction. Stone characteristics were not correlated with obstruction. Enhancement of the renal cortex was lower in obstructed kidneys. The dynamic protocol reduced the radiation dose.",Excluded
303,"Multidisciplinary team approach for Merkel cell carcinoma: the European Institute of Oncology experience with focus on radiotherapy Objective: To review the therapeutic strategy in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) treated with radiotherapy (RT) discussed in a multidisciplinary tumour board. Method(s): Clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of MCC and with an indication to undergo RT at the European Institute of Oncology between 2003 and 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were included in the analysis (median age 65 years, range 42-87). Nineteen received adjuvant RT, 4 exclusive RT, and the remainder palliative RT. Intensity-modulated RT was used in 13 cases, a 3D conformal technique in 11 cases, and stereotactic RT in 2 cases. No major toxicities were recorded. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) after adjuvant RT was 20.5 months, while for unknown primary MCC, it was 23 months. In the adjuvant setting, median polyomavirus-positive RFS was 21.5 months (range 1-49) and median polyomavirus-negative RFS was only 14 months (range 4-45). Overall, RFS of polyomavirus-positive and polyomavirus-negative patients was 10.5 and 8 months, respectively. After adjuvant RT, only 1 out of 10 patients had a recurrence in the RT field. At the time of data collection, 16 patients were alive with no evidence of disease, 1 patient was alive with advanced status of disease, 8 patients died of disease progression, and 1 patient died of other causes. Conclusion(s): The management of unknown primary and polyomavirus-positive cases, which had a better prognosis in our series, may benefit from a multidisciplinary approach, given the limited data available regarding optimal treatment.Copyright © Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori 2020.",Excluded
711,"Detectability of radiation-induced changes in magnetic resonance biomarkers following stereotactic radiosurgery: A pilot study Our objective was to investigate direct voxel-wise relationship between dose and early MR biomarker changes both within and in the high-dose region surrounding brain metastases following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Specifically, we examined the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging and the contrast transfer coefficient (Ktrans) and volume of extracellular extravascular space (ve) derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data. We investigated 29 brain metastases in 18 patients using 3 T MRI to collect imaging data at day 0, day 3 and day 20 following SRS. The ADC maps were generated by the scanner and Ktrans and ve maps were generated using in-house software for dynamic tracer-kinetic analysis. To enable spatially-correlated voxel-wise analysis, we developed a registration pipeline to register all ADC, Ktrans and ve maps to the planning MRI scan. To interrogate longitudinal changes, we computed absolute DELTAADC, DELTAKtrans and DELTAve for day 3 and 20 post-SRS relative to day 0. We performed a Kruskall-Wallice test on each biomarker between time points and investigated dose correlations within the gross tumour volume (GTV) and surrounding high dose region > 12 Gy via Spearman's rho. Only ve exhibited significant differences between day 0 and 20 (p < 0.005) and day 3 and 20 (p < 0.05) within the GTV following SRS. Strongest dose correlations were observed for ADC within the GTV (rho = 0.17 to 0.20) and weak correlations were observed for ADC and Ktrans in the surrounding > 12 Gy region. Both DELTAKtrans and DELTAve showed a trend with dose at day 20 within the GTV and > 12 Gy region (rho = -0.04 to -0.16). Weak dose-related decreases in Ktrans and ve within the GTV and high dose region at day 20 most likely reflect underlying vascular responses to radiation. Our study also provides a voxel-wise analysis schema for future MR biomarker studies with the goal of elucidating surrogates for radionecrosis.",Excluded
87,"The QUANTEC criteria for parotid gland dose and their efficacy to prevent moderate to severe patient-rated xerostomia Background. Recently, the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) Group defined dose-volume constraints for the parotid glands to avoid severe xerostomia. The aim of this study was to determine if application of these QUANTEC criteria also protected against moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. Material and methods. The study population consisted of 307 head and neck cancer patients treated with primary (chemo)radiotherapy, either with 3D-CRT (56%) or with IMRT (44%). All patients participated in a standard follow-up program in which radiation-induced toxicity and quality of life were prospectively assessed. Patients who met the QUANTEC criteria were classified as low risk and otherwise as high risk. Results. In total, 41% of the patients (treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT) were classified as low risk patients. In the group treated with 3D-CRT and IMRT, it was possible to meet the QUANTEC criteria in 47% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Sparing the parotid glands with IMRT was considerably more difficult in patients with lymph node metastases and in patients with nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal tumours. Low risk patients reported significantly less moderate-to-severe xerostomia than high risk patients. However, the predicted risk of elderly patients and patients with pre-existing minor patient-rated xerostomia at baseline was > 20%, even when the QUANTEC criteria were met. Conclusions. Significantly lower rates of radiation-induced patient-rated xerostomia were found among low risk patients treated according to the QUANTEC criteria, but these criteria do not completely protect against xerostomia. Particularly in elderly patients and patients already suffering from minor xerostomia at baseline, the QUANTEC criteria do not sufficiently protect against persistent, moderate-to-severe patient-rated xerostomia. © 2014 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
195,"A system for in vivo measurement of bone calcium by local neutron activation of the hand A 252Cf neutron-irradiation facility designed specifically for clinical in vivo measurement of calcium in the hand is described. Results of preliminary measurements are presented. Hand phantoms were exposed to the neutron beam for 10 min and the induced 49Ca activities were counted for 10 min after an elapsed time of 2 min. The results indicate that with a 2 X 100 micrograms 252Cf neutron source and two 20.3 X 12.7 cm NaI crystals, the counts per gram of bone mineral mass changes by about 4% for each 100 cm3 change in the overall volume (soft tissue plus bone) of the hand. For hands of equal volumes the counts per gram are expected to be almost independent of the bone volume. With an absorbed dose equivalent of 150 mSv (15 rem), the sensitivity is about 200 counts per 10 min per gram Ca. The statistical reproducibility of the results is better than 3% for the average value of 11 g Ca in the normal hand.",Excluded
0,Efficacy of radiation therapy for the treatment of macroscopic canine oral soft tissue sarcoma This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p=0.2292). The results of this study suggest that radiation therapy is useful in the treatment of oral soft tissue sarcoma.,Excluded
1005,"Salvage radiotherapy in patients with recurrent or refractory primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma after chemotherapy From October 2007 to June 2013, 13 patients (7 men, 6 women: median age, 58 years) treated with salvage radiation therapy (RT) for recurrent/refractory primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma (CNSL) after chemotherapy at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. The histological analysis showed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma in 12 and 1 patient, respectively. After initial chemotherapy, 1 patient showed initial complete response, 8 showed partial response and 4 showed progressive disease. Eleven patients had primary CNSL and 2 had secondary CNSL. The median total radiation dose was 40 Gy (range, 30-60 Gy). The median overall survival time from start of salvage RT was 16.3 months. The 1-year overall survival rate was 64%.

1204,"The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in the local management of desmoplastic melanoma BACKGROUND In the current study, the authors sought to evaluate outcomes, specifically with respect to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), for patients with desmoplastic melanoma. METHODS The records of 130 consecutive patients who presented between 1985 and 2009 with nonmetastatic desmoplastic melanoma and were treated curatively with either surgery alone (59 patients; 45%) or surgery and postoperative RT (71 patients; 55%) were retrospectively reviewed. Ages ranged from 21 years to 97 years (median age, 66 years). The location of the primary tumor was in the head and neck region in 62% of patients. Only 5 patients (4%) had lymph node involvement at the time of presentation. RESULTS The median follow-up was 6.6 years (range, 11 months-24 years). Overall survival rates at 5 years and 10 years were 69% and 53%, respectively. Disease-specific survival rates were 84% and 80%, respectively, at 5 years and 10 years. The actuarial rate of local recurrence was 17% at 5 years and beyond. Of the patients who underwent surgery without receiving postoperative RT, 14 (24%) experienced local recurrence. Of the 71 patients treated with surgery and postoperative RT, 5 (7%) experienced local recurrence. In a Cox multivariate regression model, improved local control was significantly associated with the receipt of postoperative RT (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS Surgery followed by postoperative RT appears to provide superior local control compared with surgery alone for patients with desmoplastic melanoma.

1770,"Identification of the most important features of knee osteoarthritis structural progressors using machine learning methods Objectives: The aim was to identify the most important features of structural knee osteoarthritis (OA) progressors and classification using machine learning methods. Method(s): Participants, features and outcomes were from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Features were from baseline (1107), including articular knee tissues (135) assessed by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). OA progressors were ascertained by four outcomes: cartilage volume loss in medial plateau at 48 and 96 months (Prop_CV_48M, 96M), Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade 2 and medial joint space narrowing (JSN) 1 at 48 months. Six feature selection models were used to identify the common features in each outcome. Six classification methods were applied to measure the accuracy of the selected features in classifying the subjects into progressors and non-progressors. Classification of the best features was done using an automatic machine learning interface and the area under the curve (AUC). To prioritize the top five features, sparse partial least square (sPLS) method was used. Result(s): For the classification of the best common features in each outcome, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) achieved the highest AUC in Prop_CV_96M, KL and JSN (0.80, 0.88, 0.95), and Gradient Boosting Machine for Prop_CV_48M (0.70). sPLS showed the baseline top five features to predict knee OA progressors are the joint space width, mean cartilage thickness of the medial tibial plateau and sub-regions and JSN. Conclusion(s): In this comprehensive study using a large number of features (n = 1107) and MRI outcomes in addition to radiological outcomes, we identified the best features and classification methods for knee OA structural progressors. Data revealed baseline X-ray and MRI-based features could predict early OA knee progressors and that MLP is the best classification method.Copyright © The Author(s), 2020.",Excluded
2139,"Effects of radiation therapy on the meibomian glands and dry eye in patients with ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy (RT) is the treatment of choice in patients with low-grade ocular adenexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (OAML) and many of them experience post-RT dry eye with varying severity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate ocular effects of RT on meibomian glands and dry eye by directly visualizing structural changes. Secondly, we focused on the comparison of two groups of patients according to tumor location and radiation technique. METHOD(S): Sixty-four eyes with OAML of conjunctiva, orbit, lacrimal gland, or lacrimal sac were grouped into conjunctival lymphoma and ""orbital-type"" lymphoma (i.e., orbit, lacrimal gland, and lacrimal sac). Subjects were investigated for morphological changes in meibomian glands by meiboscore grading system. Radiation technique was examined and Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, Schirmer's test, tear film break-up time (TBUT), slit lamp examination of corneal surface and lid margin abnormality were conducted before and after RT. RESULT(S): The increase in meiboscore was statistically significant over time after RT in both groups (P <0.001). The extent of increase in meiboscore was significantly greater in the ""orbital-type"" lymphoma group than in the conjunctival lymphoma group (P <0.001). The changes in OSDI, TBUT, corneal fluorescein staining score and lid margin abnormality score after RT were significantly different across two groups (P =0.042, 0.001, 0.035 and 0.001, respectively). Schirmer's value decreased after RT in both groups. Dry eye symptoms were most severe right after RT in both groups, but a gradual resolution was noted in most patients with conjunctival lymphoma, whereas symptoms persisted in ""orbital-type"" lymphoma patients. The OSDI score and corneal fluorescein staining score were positively correlated with meiboscore in ""orbital-type"" patients at post-RT 6months (r =0.43, P =0.04; r =0.39, P =0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Patients with OAML had different degrees of morphological changes in meibomian glands according to tumor location and radiation technique. ""Orbital-type"" lymphoma patients are more likely to experience severe injury to meibomian glands, which eventually leads to persistent dry eye. Patients with ""orbital-type"" lymphoma should be well informed of post-RT damage on meibomian glands and persistent dry eye.",Excluded

684,"Facial involvement in indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and metabolic syndrome-a cross-sectional study Introduction: Face was often thought to be spared in psoriasis possibly due to the protective effect of sebum and low-dose ambient UV radiation exposure. Few have suggested that facial involvement is common and indicates disease severity. There is a paucity of data on this, particularly from India. Psoriatics have a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and, patients with severe disease are at greater risk. Objective(s): We decided to study the frequency, type of facial involvement in Indian psoriatic patients and its association with disease severity and MetS. Material(s) and Method(s): 250 consecutive psoriatic patients were enrolled. Facial psoriatics were divided into peripherofacial(PF), centrofacial(CF) and mixed facial(MF) types. Disease severity was assessed using whole body, scalp, facial Psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores and Nail area psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) scores. Patients were evaluated for the presence of MetS using NCEP-III criteria. All parameters were compared both between facial and non-facial psoriatics and, between cases with different types of face involvement. Result(s): The mean age(p-0.04) and age of onset of disease(p-0.02) was lower and median whole body PASI score higher(p<0.001) in psoriatics with facial involvement than those without. No significant association was found between facial involvement and MetS. MF was the commonest type of facial involvement and there was a significant association of mixed facial involvement with increased total body PASI and head PASI scores. (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Facial involvement in psoriatics is associated with severe disease, but not metabolic syndrome. Mixed facial type might be considered a marker of overall psoriasis disease severity in the Indian population.",Excluded
2235,"Estimating the incidence of leukemia attributable to occupational exposure in Iran Objective: The aim this study was to estimate the fraction of leukemia incidence in Iran attributable to occupational exposure to benzene, ionizing radiation, and ethylene oxide. Method(s): Nationwide exposure to each of these leukemogens was estimated using workforce data available at the ILO (International Labor Organization) website. The prevalence of exposure to leukemogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database. The magnitude of the relative risk of leukemia for each leukemogen was from published literature. Using the Levin's population attributable risk (incidence), fractions of leukemia incidences attributed to workplace leukemogens were then estimated. Result(s): The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census included 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture was the largest sector with 24.5% of the males and 0.27% of the females, and the electricals-related sector was the smallest with 1.16% of the males and 0.66% of the females. After applying the CAREX exposure estimates to each sector, the proportion exposed to leukemogens was 0.016% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 3.6 (95% CI of 3.2-4.2) for high exposure and 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.1) for low exposure and employing the Levin's formula, the fraction of leukemia attributed to leukemogens in the workplaces among females was 3.6% (95% CI of 3.1-4.5) and among males was 7.6% (95% CI of 6.4-9.2). These fractions corresponded to estimated incidences of 0.60 (95% CI of 0.50-0.70) and 0.22 (95% CI of 0.16-0.23) cases of leukemia per 100,000 populations for males and females, respectively. Conclusion(s): The incidence of leukemia due to occupational exposure is very low in Iran, although males are at greater risk than females.",Included
2097,"Impact of low dose myocardial perfusion imaging on patient radiation effective dose and imaging time in real world clinical practice Objectives To demonstrate proof of concept/practicality of reducing medical radiation exposure from myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) by adopting low dose protocols in real world clinical practice. Methods A cohort of 100 consecutive patients who were referred for MPI to our nuclear medicine service was imaged with a low dose rest-stress MPI protocol. Traditionally used doses of 10 millicuries (mCi) or 370 megabecquerel (MBq) at rest and 30 mCi (1110 MBq) at stress were decreased to half for the low dose protocol, 5 mCi (185 MBq) at rest and 15 mCi (555MBq) at stress. This decision was based on the principle of lowering the injected dose as much as practically feasible while obtaining good diagnostic quality images with similar 1 million count threshold for image acquisition in a reasonable, patient comfortable imaging time [1]. All imaging was performed using an ultrafast, high resolution, dedicated cardiac camera (D-SPECT, Spectrum Dynamics) [2] in upright position for rest and stress. An additional supine stress image was additionally acquired [3]. The low dose patient cohort was retrospectively compared to a cohort of 100 consecutive patients referred to our service for MPI who were imaged using the traditional dose protocol immediately preceding the adoption of the low dose protocol. Comparison between the two groups in different protocols was made using the average values of administered doses in mCi, radiation effective dose in millisieverts (mSv) and the imaging time in minutes: seconds for each rest, stress and total MPI. All patients were imaged using a single day, rest-stress protocol with technetium99m-sestamibi using either exercise or pharmacological stress as determined clinically by the cardiology team. Results A total of 200 patients with 100 patients in each cohort were evaluated. Traditional dose patients had an average age of 69.8 years (y), male: female ratio of 59:41, weight of 85 kilograms (kg), received a dose of 10.4 mCi (385 MBq) at rest, 31.1 mCi (1151 MBq) at stress. Low dose patients had an average age of 66.6 y, male: female ratio of 52:48, weighed 83.3 kg, and received a dose of 5.28 mCi (195 MBq) at rest, 16.0 mCi (592 MBq) at stress. High dose imaging time in minutes: seconds was 8:17 (rest), 1:46 (stress) and 10:03 (total). Low dose imaging time was 14:36 (rest), 3:24 (stress) and 18:00 (total). As compared to traditional dose protocols, low dose protocols demonstrated significant reduction in average radiation effective dose of 49.1% in rest, 48.5% in stress and 48.7% in total rest-stress MPI. As expected, an increase in imaging time was noted in the low dose protocol, with an average increase of 07:20 min in rest, 03:14 min in stress and 10:34 min in total imaging time, which did not significantly impact patient throughput. No patient complaints were encountered with regards to imaging time by the imaging team. All images were of diagnostic quality, acquired by identical parameters of 1 million count threshold for image acquisition and deemed clinically interpretable by a team of board certified clinical nuclear medicine providers. Conclusions MPI contributes significantly to medical radiation exposure [4]. Low dose MPI can be easily implemented clinically using newer high resolution cardiac specific cameras to achieve markedly lower radiation effective doses to the patient population without significantly impacting patient throughput or diagnostic quality of images. Low dose MPI leads to decreasing medical radiation exposure to the patients, their caregivers, medical staff [5] and to the community as a whole.",Excluded
3258,"Feasibility and Safety of Ultrasonography Guidance and Flank Position during Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Purpose: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is generally performed using fluoroscopy, which is associated with exposure to radiation. Another drawback of fluoroscopic guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the prone position, which is not suitable for all patients. In this study we evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 603 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 50.9 +/- 13 years were included in this study from December 2010 to July 2016. Access to the collecting system and tract dilation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Perioperative data on the stone-free rate, operative time, length of stay and complication rates were recorded. Result(s): Successful access was achieved in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time was 56.6 +/- 6.5 minutes. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 529 patients (87.7%) and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications were noted in 17 (2.8%). Blood transfusion was necessary in 43 patients (7.1%). However, bleeding was self-limited in all cases and did not require angioembolization. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the largest series of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Unlike in other studies we used this procedure in all patients irrespective of stone burden, renal anomaly and body habitus. Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy has outcomes comparable to those of conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is not associated with radiation exposure. Furthermore, anesthesia while in the flank position might be less harmful in some patients, including those with obesity or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded
2991,"Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: The significance of radiotherapeutic parameters BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between local recurrence and radiotherapeutic parameters, including dose and RT radiotherapy (RT) field. METHODS. The current study included 35 patients who were diagnosed with immunohistochemically confirmed nasal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma between 1976 and 2004. There were 21 males and 14 females, and they ranged in age from 18 years to 76 years (median, 51 yrs). The primary tumor originated in the nasal cavity in 28 patients, and 32 patients had Stage I disease. Seventeen patients received treatment solely with RT, and the remaining 18 patients received a combination of chemotherapy and RT. The median tumor dose was 50 grays (Gy) (range, 22-60 Gy). Twenty-seven patients received RT to include all macroscopic lesions, all paranasal sinuses, the palate, and the nasopharynx. Eight patients received RT to all macroscopic lesions with generous margins. RESULTS. A complete remission (CR) or a CR/unconfirmed was achieved in 28 patients (80%). The 5-year overall survival (OAS) rate, disease-free survival (DFS) rate, and local control probability (LCP) were 47.3%, 42.9%, and 65.2%, respectively. Patients who received RT only to macroscopic lesions fared less well in terms of LCP (LCP 5 years, 71.9% vs. 41.7%; P = 0.007). The difference in RT field also affected both the OAS rate and the DFS rate. Patients who received RT doses >= 50 Gy tended to achieve favorable local control. CONCLUSIONS. In the management of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma, the RT field affected treatment outcomes. RT doses >= 50 Gy resulted in favorable local control. © 2005 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 on days -14, 0, and +14, and 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/m2/d from day -14 to the end of radiation therapy (day 0 is the start of radiation therapy). Radiation therapy consisted of 41.4 Gy in 18 fractions (2.3 Gy per fraction) with Tomotherapy to the tumor and regional lymph nodes (planning target volume, PTV) defined on simulation CT and MRI. After 9 fractions simulation CT and MRI were repeated for the planning of the adaptive phase: PTVadapt was generated by adding a 5-mm margin to the residual tumor. In the last 6 fractions a boost of 3.0 Gy per fraction (in total 45.6 Gy in 18 fractions) was delivered to PTVadapt while concomitantly delivering 2.3 Gy per fraction to PTV outside PTVadapt. Result(s): Three patients experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity; 2 of 3 showed toxicity before the adaptive phase. Full dose of radiation therapy, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil was delivered in 96%, 96%, and 88% of patients, respectively. Two patients with clinical complete response (cCR) refused surgery and were still cCR at 17 and 29 months. For the remaining 23 resected patients, 15 of 23 (65%) showed tumor regression grade 3 response, and 7 of 23 (30%) had pathologic complete response; 8 (35%) and 12 (52%) tumor regression grade 3 patients had <=5% and 10% residual viable cells, respectively. Conclusion(s): An adaptive boost strategy is feasible, with an acceptable grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity rate and a very encouraging tumor response rate. The results suggest that there should still be room for further dose escalation of the residual tumor with the aim of increasing pathologic complete response and/or cCR rates. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1092,"Assessment of cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer's disease by spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging To evaluate the utility of arterial spin-labeled blood flow magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of cerebral blood flow abnormalities in Alzheimer's disease, arterial spin-labeled blood flow images in 16 contiguous 5-mm axial sections were acquired in 18 patients diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease and 11 age-matched controls. Blood flow images from all subjects were transformed to a standard anatomical space for voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis. High quality blood flow images were obtained from all but 1 subject. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant flow decreases relative to control subjects in temporal, parietal, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices. Increased severity of disease, as measured by Mini-Mental State Examination, correlated with posterior parietal and posterior cingulate decreases but not temporal decreases. Arterial spin-labeled magnetic resonance imaging was found to be an effective tool for characterizing flow decreases accompanying Alzheimer's disease. The absence of ionizing radiation or injection and the ability to obtain high quality anatomical images within the same scanning session make arterial spin labeling an attractive technique for the study of Alzheimer's disease, for the evaluation of pharmacological therapies, and, possibly, for early diagnosis.",Excluded
951,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded
1629,"CT-Guided Microcoil Localization of Small Peripheral Pulmonary Nodules to Direct Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Resection without the Aid of Intraoperative Fluoroscopy OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of CT-guided microcoil localization of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) for guiding video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2016 and October 2019, 454 consecutive patients with 501 SPNs who received CT-guided microcoil localization before VATS in our institution were enrolled. The diameter of the nodules was 0.93 +/- 0.49 cm, and the shortest distance from the nodules to the pleura was 1.41 +/- 0.95 cm. The distal end of the microcoil was placed less than 1 cm away from the nodule, and the proximal end was placed outside the visceral pleura. VATS was performed under the guidance of implanted microcoils without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy. RESULT(S): All 501 nodules were marked with microcoils. The time required for microcoil localization was 12.8 +/- 5.2 minutes. Microcoil localization-related complications occurred in 179 cases (39.4%). None of the complications required treatment. A total of 463 nodules were successfully resected under the guidance of implanted microcoils. VATS revealed 38 patients with dislocated microcoils, of which 28 underwent wedge resection (21 cases under the guidance of the bleeding points of pleural puncture, 7 cases through palpation), 5 underwent direct lobectomy, and the remaining 5 underwent a conversion to thoracotomy. In 4 cases, a portion of the microcoil remained in the lung parenchyma. CONCLUSION(S): CT-guided microcoil localization of SPNs is safe and reliable. Marking the nodule and pleura simultaneously with microcoils can effectively guide the resection of SPNs using VATS without the aid of intraoperative fluoroscopy.Copyright © 2021 The Korean Society of Radiology.",Excluded
650,"Gender difference in the development of ischemic heart disease in emergency workers of the Chernobyl accident Objectives: Since women accounted for only 8.7% of the total number of Chernobyl emergency workers (EW), the radiation effect on cardiovascular system was previously studied mainly in men. So the goal of current investigation was to determine the development of ischemic heart disease (IHD) in men and women exposed to ionizing radiation. Method(s): The study included 598 EW of 1986 year (472 men and 126 women) who had no signs of cardiac pathology during they took part in elimination of consequences caused by the Chernobyl accident. For that time women's age was 41+/-6.9 years, but men 37.8+/-8.5 years (p=0.011). The female group was also significantly older than the male at the time of the examination (69.1+/-7.2 versus 63.7+/-10.4, p=0). Patients of both groups in 2012-2016 after admission in our hospital had cardiologist examination, electrocardiography, daily monitoring of electrocardiogram, echocardiography. Result(s): At the time of examination IHD in women was more often combined with arterial hypertension (94.4% compared to 87.7% in men, p=0.001), diabetes mellitus (27.0% vs. 23.9% in men, p=0.828), alimentary obesity (57.1% vs. 39.2%, p=0) and hypercholesterolemia (66.7% versus 60.4%, p=0.239). In both groups, the portion of patients with stroke was practically equal (9.5% and 9.7%) as well as with blockade (2.4% and 2.3%), atrial fibrillation (16.7% and 16.5%), and ventricular extrasystoles (7.9% and 7%). Men were more likely to have supraventricular arrhythmias (13.3% and 1.6%, p=0.042) and higher number of smokers (40.9% and 1.6%, p=0). It was shown that 25% of all male EW developed IHD in 11.7+/-0.5 years after irradiation, while the same number of EW-women after 15.5+/-1.3 years. Exactly half of male group had the diagnosis of IHD after 18.7+/-0.8 years while women after 21.6+/-0.7 years. After 24.7+/-0.4 and 26.8+/-0.5 years, IHD developed in 75% of men and women, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed high reliability of differences in the development of IHD in two examined groups (logrank test: chi<sup>2</sup> = 10.001, p=0,001). The median survival rate fell on the age of 57+/-0.6 years for men and 61.4+/-0.9 years of women. Conclusion(s): The gender specific features of IHD development in EW consisted in its earlier term of onset after irradiation in men than in women. Men developed IHD at younger age than women despite the presence of a greater number of people with risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia and obesity.",Included
1908,"Successful introduction of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention system into Japanese clinical practice: a first-year survey at single center In Japan, a robotic-assisted PCI (R-PCI) system, the CorPath GRX System (Corindus Inc.), has been approved for clinical use in 2018, which is the first introduction of R-PCI into Japan. In this study, the clinical performance of the R-PCI system in the initial year at Kurume University Hospital was evaluated comparing with conventional manual PCI (M-PCI). A total of 30 R-PCI and 77 M-PCI procedures performed between April 2019 and March 2020, were retrospectively included. The primary outcome was the rate of clinical success defined as < 30% residual stenosis without in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The secondary outcomes were fluoroscopy time, dose area product (DAP), amount of radiation exposure to operators and assistants, procedural time, and contrast volume. Propensity-matching technique was used to match each R-PCI lesion to the nearest M-PCI lesion without replacement. After propensity score matching, 30 R-PCI procedures in 28 patients and 37 M-PCI procedures in 35 patients were analyzed. Clinical success rate with R-PCI was favorable and comparable to M-PCI (93.3 vs. 94.6%, p = 0.97), without any in-hospital MACE. The operator radiation exposure was significantly lower in R-PCI (0 vs. 24.5 microSV, p < 0.0001). Radiation exposure to the patients was tended to be reduced by R-PCI (DAP: 77.6 vs. 100.2 Gycm2, p = 0.07). There were no statistically significant differences in radiation exposure to the assistant, fluoroscopy time, procedural time and contrast volume between the two groups (radiation exposure to the assistant: 10.5 vs. 10.0 microSV, p = 0.64, fluoroscopy time: 27.5 vs. 30.1 min, p = 0.55, procedural time: 72.4 vs. 61.6 min, p = 0.23, and contrast volume: 93.2 vs. 102.0 ml, p = 0.36).

81,"The effect of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography on the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma PURPOSE: To assess the effect of positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on the treatment of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 38 patients with newly diagnosed (n = 25) and recurrent (n = 13) cutaneous melanoma who were referred for evaluation with FDG PET imaging at our institution. We compared the PET findings with computed tomography (CT), which was available in 21 (55%) patients, and tabulated the changes in the diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic management that were prompted by PET during a follow-up period of 10 to 36 months., RESULTS: Compared with PET, the extent of disease was underestimated by CT in 5 (13%) patients. Planned surgical resection of metastases was canceled in two of these patients. In another patient, surveillance PET detected an unsuspected hypermetabolic abdominal mass that was noted on a subsequent CT to arise from the small bowel. The mass was found to be jejunal metastatic melanoma at the time of resection. Overall, PET influenced surgical management in 3 (8%) patients, but it did not affect the wait-and-watch strategy or decision to initiate immunotherapy in the others., CONCLUSIONS: FDG PET contributes important information not provided by CT and has a substantial effect on the clinical management of patients with malignant melanoma.",Excluded
366,"A Pilot Study of Safer Radiation Dosage to the Heart and Its Subregions Background and Objectives: The real impact of ionizing radiation on the heart and poorer overall survival for patients with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This study aims to determine the safe dose constraints to the heart's subregions that could prevent patients' early non-cancerous death and improve their quality of life. Methods and Materials: A retrospective cohort study was performed containing 51 consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC and treated using 3D, Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) radiotherapy. For a dosimetric analysis, these structures were chosen: heart, heart base (HB), and region of great blood vessels (GBV). Dose-volume histograms (DVH) were recorded for all mentioned structures. Maximum and mean doses to the heart, HB, the muscle mass of the HB, and GBV were obtained. V10-V60 (%) parameters were calculated from the DVH. After performed statistical analysis, logistic regression models were created, and critical doses calculated. Result(s): The critical dose for developing a fatal endpoint for HB was 30.5 Gy, while for GBV, it was 46.3 Gy. Increasing the average dose to the HB or GBV by 1 Gy from the critical dose further increases the possibility of early death by 22.0% and 15.8%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We suggest that the non-canonical sub-regions of the heart (HB and GBV) should be considered during the planning stage. Additional constraints of the heart subregions should be chosen accordingly, and we propose that the mean doses to these regions be 30.5 Gy and 46.3 Gy, respectively, or less. Extrapolated DVH curves for both regions may be used during the planning stage with care.",Excluded
261,"Temporal trends of fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization in coronary chronic total occlusion revascularization: insights from a multicenter United States registry BACKGROUND: The impact of operator experience on fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) has received limited study., METHODS: We evaluated temporal trends in fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization among 1,363 consecutive CTO PCIs performed at three US institutions between January 2006 and November 2011., RESULTS: Mean age was 65 +/- 11 years, 85% of patients were men, 40% had diabetes, 37% had prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and 42% had prior PCI. The CTO target vessel was the right coronary artery (55%), circumflex (23%), left anterior descending artery (21%), and left main or bypass graft (1%). The retrograde approach was used in 34% of all procedures. The technical and procedural success rates were 85.5 and 84.2%, respectively. The mean procedural time, fluoroscopy time, and contrast utilization were 113 +/- 61 min, 42 +/- 29 min, and 294 +/- 158 mL, respectively. Years since initiation of CTO PCI were independently associated with higher technical success rate (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.52-1.70, P < 0.001), lower fluoroscopy time (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.75-0.95, P = 0.005), and contrast utilization (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.62-0.79, P < 0.001) during the study period., CONCLUSIONS: Among selected US-based institutions performing CTO PCI, we observed a significant reduction in total fluoroscopy time and contrast utilization paralleled with an improved technical success rate over time.

564,"Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry for Measurement of Phalangeal Bone Mineral Density on a Slot-Scanning Digital Radiography System Objective: In this paper, we assess the feasibility of using two detectors in a slot-scanning digital radiography system to acquire images for measuring bone mineral density (BMD) of the middle phalanx of the middle finger using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Method(s): Simulations were used to evaluate the spectral separation of the low- and high-energy spectra and detective quantum efficiency was used for assessing image quality. Scan parameters were chosen to optimize spectral separation, image quality, and radiation dose. We introduce the measurement of volumetric BMD (vBMD) using basis material decomposition. We assess the accuracy of our methods by comparing measurements taken using bone images against reference data derived from subsequent incineration of the bones. In vivo scans were conducted to evaluate the system precision (repeatability) and agreement with a clinical densitometer. Result(s): Average errors for bone mineral content (BMC), areal BMD (aBMD), and vBMD were 4.85%, 5.49%, and 12.77%, respectively. Our system had good agreement with a clinical densitometer based on concordance correlation coefficient values of 0.92 and 0.98 for aBMD and BMC, respectively. Precision studies yielded coefficient of variation (CV) values of 1.35% for aBMD, 1.48% for BMC, and 1.80% for vBMD. The CV values of all measurements were within 2%, indicating that the methods have clinically acceptable precision. Conclusion(s): We conclude that our techniques yield bone measurements with high accuracy, clinically acceptable precision, and good agreement with a clinical densitometer.

2856,"Critical analysis of lumbar interspinous devices failures: A retrospective study Interspinous devices (IDs) were introduced in the 90s. Since then, they have rapidly become very popular for the minimally invasive treatment of lumbar pain disorders. They feature different shapes and biomechanical characteristics, and are used in the spine degenerative pathologies or as motion segment stabilizers (dynamic stabilization) or to obtain the decompression of neurological structures. The indications seem to be rather narrow and still to be verified in terms of their clinical efficacy. However, IDs are being extensively utilized beyond their classical indications with the inevitable risk of a clinical failure. The aim of the present work was to carry out a critical analysis of the causes of failure in a series of 19 patients. From January 2007 to March 2009, 19 patients with residual painful syndrome after the implantation of IDs were observed. The series includes 11 males and 8 females with a mean age of 53.6 years (range 38-84 years) who were operated on elsewhere and who underwent revision surgery at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were low back pain and/or radiculopathy after the device implantation without improvement of the painful symptomatology, radiculopathy with signs of sensory and motor deficit, intermittent neurogenic claudication, and infection. All patients were thoroughly re-assessed with new standard imaging examinations such as MRI and CT scans, considering the following image features: the position of the device with respect to the spinous processes (X-ray), the intervertebral disc disease of the level operated upon or of the adjacent levels (MRI), the segmental instability (dynamic X-rays), the severity of the canal stenosis (CT). The accurate evaluation of the clinical and imaging parameters revealed three main causes of failure: errors of indication, technical errors and the structural failure of the ID. The most frequent cause of failure was a wrong indication. The results of the study are presented and the causes of failure are discussed in detail. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2835,"Octreotide acetate enables the administration of chemoradiotherapy, including the oral anticancer drug S-1, in gastric cancer patients with malignant gastrointestinal obstruction Advanced gastric cancer frequently RESULTS in the inability to ingest food or drink orally, a condition called malignant gastrointestinal obstruction (MGO). MGO is clinically defned as a gastrointestinal outlet obstruction caused by a large tumor, or malignant bowel obstruction with peritoneal dissemination. MGO impacts the quality of life by interfering with oral intake and by causing gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Octreotide acetate (OA) is an analogue of somatostatin which has been increasingly used to relieve gastrointestinal symptoms since it decreases the secretion of digestive juices and increases the absorption of water and electrolytes. In Japan, the oral anticancer drug S-1 was recently adopted as a key chemotherapeutic agent in advanced gastric cancer; however, its oral formulation precludes its utility in the MGO setting. This is a pilot study of chemoradiotherapy plus OA in gastric cancer with MGO. Patients were initially treated with OA to control gastrointestinal symptoms. Following resolution of their symptoms, the patients received chemotherapy with S-1 plus low-dose cisplatin and radiation. Irradiation was targeted at the primary tumor and surrounding lesions, including the lymph nodes. Grade 4 toxicity was observed in only 1 patient, and no treatment-related deaths were noted. After treatment, 3 patients achieved a partial response and 4 achieved stable disease. Of the 9 patients, 8 were able to tolerate solid food orally and were discharged. The outcomes of these cases suggest that OA is a useful adjunctive therapy that enables advanced gastric cancer patients with MGO to receive S-1-containing chemotherapy.",Excluded
1890,"53BP1 Repair Kinetics for Prediction of In Vivo Radiation Susceptibility in 15 Mouse Strains We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.Copyright ©2020 by Radiation Research Society.

Methods Post-processing software was used to simulate C-arm angulations in two dimensions (oblique, cranial/caudal) for appropriate visualisation of distal landing zones at the iliac bifurcation during EVAR. Retrospectively, 27 consecutive EVAR patients (25 men, mean +/- SD age 73 +/- 7 years) were identified; one group of patients (NEW; n = 12 [23 iliac bifurcations]) was compared after implementation of the new method with a group of patients who received a historic method (OLD; n = 15 [23 iliac bifurcations]), treated with EVAR before the method was applied. Results In the OLD group, a median of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-3) digital subtraction angiography runs were needed per iliac bifurcation versus 1.0 (IQR 1-1) runs in the NEW group (p = .007). The median dose area products per iliac bifurcation were 11951 mGy*cm2 (IQR 7308-16663 mGy*cm2) for the NEW, and 39394 mGy*cm2 (IQR 19066-53702 mGy*cm2) for the OLD group, respectively (p = .001). The median volume of contrast per iliac bifurcation was 13.0 mL (IQR: 13-13 mL) in the NEW and 26 mL (IQR 13-39 mL) in the OLD group (p = .007). Conclusion Pre-operative simulation of the appropriate C-arm angulation in two dimensions using dedicated computed tomography angiography post-processing software is feasible and significantly reduces radiation and contrast medium exposure.Copyright © 2016 European Society for Vascular Surgery",Excluded
2871,"Interactions between auditory 'what' and 'where' pathways revealed by enhanced near-threshold discrimination of frequency and position Partially segregated neuronal pathways (""what"" and ""where"" pathways, respectively) are thought to mediate sound recognition and localization. Less studied are interactions between these pathways. In two experiments, we investigated whether near-threshold pitch discrimination sensitivity (d') is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant position differences and likewise whether near-threshold position discrimination sensitivity is altered by supra-threshold task-irrelevant pitch differences. Each experiment followed a 2 x 2 within-subjects design regarding changes/no change in the task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. In Experiment 1, subjects discriminated between 750 Hz and 752 Hz pure tones, and d' for this near-threshold pitch change significantly increased by a factor of 1.09 when accompanied by a task-irrelevant position change of 65 micros interaural time difference (ITD). No response bias was induced by the task-irrelevant position change. In Experiment 2, subjects discriminated between 385 micros and 431 micros ITDs, and d' for this near-threshold position change significantly increased by a factor of 0.73 when accompanied by task-irrelevant pitch changes (6 Hz). In contrast to Experiment 1, task-irrelevant pitch changes induced a response criterion bias toward responding that the two stimuli differed. The collective results are indicative of facilitative interactions between ""what"" and ""where"" pathways. By demonstrating how these pathways may cooperate under impoverished listening conditions, our results bear implications for possible neuro-rehabilitation strategies. We discuss our results in terms of the dual-pathway model of auditory processing.",Excluded
375,"LED photoprevention: reduced MED response following multiple LED exposures BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As photoprotection with traditional sunscreen presents some limitations, the use of non-traditional treatments to increase skin resistance to ultraviolet (UV) induced damage would prove particularly appealing. The purpose of this pilot study was to test the potential of non-thermal pulsed light-emitting diode (LED) treatments (660 nm) prior to UV exposure in the induction of a state of cellular resistance against UV-induced erythema., STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen healthy subjects and two patients with polymorphous light eruption (PLE) were exposed to 5, 6, or 10 LED treatments (660 nm) on an EXPERIMENTAL anterior thigh region. Individual baseline minimal erythema doses (MED) were then determined. UV radiation was thereafter performed on the LED EXPERIMENTAL and CONTROL anterior thigh areas. Finally, 24 hours post-UV irradiation, LED pre-treated MED responses were compared to the non-treated sites., RESULTS: Reduction of erythema was considered significant when erythema was reduced by >50% on the LED-treated side as opposed to CONTROL side. A significant LED treatment reduction in UV-B induced erythema reaction was observed in at least one occasion in 85% of subjects, including patients suffering from PLE. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-related pattern in results. Finally, a sun protection factor SPF-15-like effect and a reduction in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation were observed on the LED pre-treated side., CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that LED based therapy prior to UV exposure provided significant protection against UV-B induced erythema. The induction of cellular resistance to UV insults may possibly be explained by the induction of a state a natural resistance to the skin via specific cell signaling pathways and without the drawbacks and limitations of traditional sunscreens. These results represent an encouraging step towards expanding the potential applications of LED therapy and could be useful in the treatment of patients with anomalous reactions to sunlight.",Excluded
2530,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005) Objective To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort. Methods We analysed 65 719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-Associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors. Results Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/ neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/ Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45). Conclusions Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.",Included
432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded
9,"Integration of magnetoencephalography-generated functional brain maps into dose planning during arteriovenous malformation radiosurgery BACKGROUND: Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can delineate critical regions of the cortex and facilitate conformal stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) dose planning. Despite the substantial role of Gamma Knife R SRS in arteriovenous malformation (AVM) management, MEG-generated maps of critical regions have never been utilized to improve dose planning., PURPOSE: To assess the value of integrating functional brain mapping using MEG with dose planning during treatment of brain AVMs with SRS., METHODS: This case series encompassed 5 patients with motor region AVMs. Noninvasive eloquent cortex mapping was achieved using a whole-head 306-channel Neuromag R Vectorview MEG System 5-10 days before SRS. On the day of SRS, the functional brain maps were integrated onto the intraoperative dose planning magnetic resonance imaging for Leksell GammaPlan R version 10. The median AVM volume treated was 12.7 cm(3), and 18 Gy was the median margin dose., RESULTS: Functional image integration of MEG improved the recognition of critical brain structures adjacent to the AVM. This facilitated anatomical planning designed to reduce the dose to adjacent critical structures while maintaining a therapeutic dose to the AVM target.

1188,"Incidence and nature of tumors induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by gamma-irradiation In our previous studies carried out on inbred rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain (L. Gross and Y. Dreyfuss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76: 5910-5913, 1979), the tumor incidence was increased following irradiation (150 rads, 5 times, at weekly intervals), from 22 to 93% in females and from 5 to 59% in males. Experiments here reported suggest that 2 consecutive total-body gamma-irradiations of 150 rads each are sufficient to induce in rats the development of tumors, some malignant; 18 of 19 females (94.7%) developed tumors at an average age of 11.4 mo, and seven of the 14 males in this group (50%) developed tumors at an average age of 10.4 mo. In the second group, which received 3 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 20 of 23 females (86.9%) and 5 of 13 males (38.4%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.1 and 7.5 mo, respectively. In the third group, among rats which received 4 consecutive gamma-irradiations, 17 of 19 females (89.4%) and 4 of 12 males (33.3%) developed tumors at average ages of 9.4 and 10.5 mo, respectively. The etiology of tumors either developing spontaneously or induced by irradiation in rats remains to be clarified. Our attempts to detect virus particles by electron microscopy in such tumors or lymphomas have not been successful. As a working hypothesis, we are tempted to theorize that tumors or lymphomas developing spontaneously or induced by gamma irradiation in rats are caused by latent viral agents which are integrated into the cell genome and are cell associated, i.e., not separable from the rat tumor cells by conventional methods thus far used.",Included
3174,"Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in laboratory mice experimentally enclosed in the radioactive Chernobyl environment Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy using the protein-coding cytochrome b (Mtcyb) gene was assessed in laboratory mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) exposed to the Chernobyl environment. Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included
897,"Pretreatment with a single, low dose of recombinant human thyrotropin allows dose reduction of radioiodine therapy in patients with nodular goiter In patients with nodular goiter, radioiodine ((131)I) therapy results in a mean reduction in thyroid volume (TV) of approximately 40% after 1 yr. We have demonstrated that pretreatment with a single, low dose of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) doubles 24-h radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) in these patients. We have now studied the safety and efficacy of therapy with a reduced dose of (131)I after pretreatment with rhTSH. Twenty-two patients with nodular goiter received (131)I therapy, 24 h after im administration of 0.01 (n = 12) or 0.03 (n = 10) mg rhTSH. In preceding diagnostic studies using tracer doses of (131)I, 24-h RAIU without and with rhTSH pretreatment (either 0.01 or 0.03 mg) were compared. Therapeutic doses of (131)I were adjusted to the rhTSH-induced increases in 24-h RAIU and were aimed at 100 micro Ci/g thyroid tissue retained at 24 h. Pretreatment with rhTSH allowed dose reduction of (131)I therapy by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.5 in the 0.01-mg and by a factor of 2.4 +/- 0.4 in the 0.03-mg rhTSH group (P < 0.05, 0.01 vs. 0.03 mg rhTSH). Before and 1 yr after therapy, TV and the smallest cross-sectional area of the tracheal lumen were measured with magnetic resonance imaging. During the year of follow-up, serum TSH, free T(4) (FT(4)), T(3), and TSH receptor antibodies were measured at regular intervals. TV before therapy was 143 +/- 54 ml in the 0.01-mg group and 103 +/- 44 ml in the 0.03-mg rhTSH group. One year after treatment, TV reduction was 35 +/- 14% (0.01 mg rhTSH) and 41 +/- 12% (0.03 mg rhTSH). In both groups, smallest cross-sectional area of the tracheal lumen increased significantly. In the 0.01-mg rhTSH group, serum FT(4) rose, after (131)I treatment, from 15.8 +/- 2.8 to 23.2 +/- 4.4 pM. In the 0.03-mg rhTSH group, serum FT(4) rose from 15.5 +/- 2.5 to 23.5 +/- 5.1 pM. Individual peak FT(4) levels, reached between 1 and 28 d after (131)I treatment, were above the normal range in 12 patients. TSH receptor antibodies were negative in all patients before therapy and became positive in 4 patients. Hyperthyroidism developed in 3 of these 4 patients between 23 and 25 wk after therapy. In conclusion, in patients with nodular goiter pretreatment with a single, low dose of rhTSH allowed approximately 50-60% reduction of the therapeutic dose of radioiodine without compromising the efficacy of TV reduction.",Excluded
1473,"Value of a multinational approach in determining the causation of cancer MacMahon and Pugh define epidemiology as the use of knowledge on the frequency and distribution of disease to search for determinants. This paper demonstrates that a multinational approach in cancer epidemiology can be of great value in at least four circumstances: namely, the compilation and standardization of data, the assessment of risk, the pooling of study populations to obtain interpretable results, and the provision of resources for specific epidemiologic investigations. One or two examples are given for each category--the determination of international cancer incidence patterns, the evaluation of the risk posed by chemicals to man, assessment of the effects of low doses of ionizing radiation, determination of the long-term effects of exposure to asbestos substitutes, and studies on the influence of diet on esophageal cancer.",Excluded
1245,"Use of irradiated bone graft for impaction grafting in acetabular revision surgery: a review of fifty consecutive cases Impaction bone grafting is a useful technique in the armament of a revision hip surgeon. Traditionally fresh frozen allograft has been used for this technique. However there are concerns about the transmission of viral proteins and prions through this form of allograft. As a result irradiated bone graft has been favoured in some centres. There is no long term series describing the results of impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone. This paper reviews a consecutive series of 50 cases of acetabular revision surgery performed between 1995 and 2001 and followed up over a mean period of 45 months. The preoperative bone defect was graded by the Paprosky classification. There were 2 cases of type 1a, 9 type 2a, 15 type 2b, 7 type 2c, 10 type 3a and 7 type 3b. All cases were followed up clinically and radiologically. Case notes were reviewed for primary prosthesis, operative details and reason for revision. The radiographs were evaluated for signs of bone incorporation, remodelling, loosening and migration of the acetabular component. There were 5 cases of aseptic loosening at the end of the follow up period. One patient had recurrent dislocation and was revised. 20 cases (40%) showed changes suggestive of bone incorporation, while only 3 cases (6%) showed remodelling. Clinically a good or excellent outcome with absence of pain was achieved in 35 patients (70%). The results suggested that acetabular impaction bone grafting using irradiated bone graft is comparable to fresh frozen allograft. The low percentage of remodelling remains a concern and warrants further studies.",Excluded
2316,"High ambient solar UV correlates with greater beta HPV seropositivity in New South Wales, Australia Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is highly prevalent worldwide and may have a role, with sun exposure, in causing cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Little is known about the relationship of UV exposure and seroprevalence of cutaneous HPVs in the general population. Method(s): Using multiplex serology, we estimated the seroprevalence of 23 beta and 7 gamma HPVs and 7 other antigens (mu HPV1, HPV63, nu HPV41, alpha HPV16; polyomaviruses HPyV7 and MCV; p53) in a population-based sample of 1,161 Australian 45 and Up Study participants with valid data from blood specimens collected from 2010 to 2012. We calculated prevalence ratios (PR) for the association of each antigen with residential ambient solar UV and other UV-related variables. Result(s): Seropositivity for at least one beta or gamma HPV was high at 88% (beta HPVs 74%, gamma HPVs 70%), and less in women than men [e.g., PR beta-2 HPV38 1/4 0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.87; any gamma 1/4 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97]. A high ambient UV level in the 10 years before study enrollment was associated with elevated seroprevalence for genus beta (PRtertile3vs1 any beta 1/4 1.17; 95% CI, 1.07-1.28), and beta-1 to beta-3 species, but not for gamma HPVs. Other UV-related measures had less or no evidence of an association. Conclusion(s): Seroprevalence of cutaneous beta HPVs is higher with higher ambient UV exposure in the past 10 years. Impact: The observed association between ambient UV in the past 10 years and cutaneous HPVs supports further study of the possible joint role of solar UV and HPV in causing skin cancer.Copyright ©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded

Data were collected from 277 proximal femoral fracture fixations. A dynamic hip screw (DHS) was used in 145, and an intra-medullary hip screw (IMHS) was used in 132. There was no difference between the two groups with respect to age, gender or side. Altogether, there were 42% two parts, 35% were three parts and 23% were four parts extra-capsular neck fractures. There was no statistical difference in ionising radiation exposure in closed reduction of these fractures regardless of the fracture configuration or surgical experience of the surgeon. The mean screening time to implant a DHS in two part fractures was 0.48 min, for three part fractures it was 0.45 min and for four part fractures it was 0.46 min. The mean screening time to implant IMHS was 1.02 min for two part fractures, 0.96 min for three part fractures and 1.03 min for four part fractures.

579,"Selecting the best noninvasive imaging test to guide treatment after an inconclusive exercise test Opinion statement: The first step towards approaching a patient with an inconclusive stress test is to identify the initial reason why a stress test was ordered and examine what factors led to inconclusive test results. Next, it is important to ask whether the patient will benefit from further testing, as not all patients with inconclusive test results require additional testing. In patients who are at low-to-intermediate risk, it may be useful to perform coronary CT angiography (CTA) to exclude the presence of obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Among individuals with no prior history of coronary artery disease, a possible advantage of CTA is that if subclinical atherosclerosis is identified, intensification of lifestyle interventions, and often pharmacotherapy, should be advocated. On the other hand, in high-risk patients or individuals that already have coronary artery disease, the primary objective is to quantify the presence and magnitude of ischemia in order to define the potential role of coronary revascularization procedures. This can be achieved by myocardial perfusion imaging using nuclear imaging or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, a functional evaluation to identify stress-induced wall motion abnormalities using stress echocardiography or MRI can be obtained. In selecting which test to obtain, it is important to understand the strengths and limitations of different imaging tests and to consider patient factors (e.g., body habitus) that may influence the accuracy of various tests. In addition, physicians should consider whether there are any other clinical questions that require imaging. For instance, cardiac MRI may be used to evaluate for infiltrative myocardial disease or pericardial disease whereas cardiac CT can evaluate for lung pathology or diseases of the aorta. Finally, any decision regarding what type of additional testing to obtain should also be based on knowing the local expertise and availability of various testing options. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded
3327,"Superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging for early and late radiation-induced hepatic injuries Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MRI was performed in twenty-one patients undergoing proton-beam radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinomas. Patients were divided into two groups: early and late phase hepatic injuries. Each group was investigated 3 to 9 weeks and 4 to 65 months after the start of irradiation, respectively. T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2*-weighted images were obtained before and after SPIO administration. In all postcontrast sequences in the early phase, irradiated livers demonstrated relatively higher intensity than nonirradiated livers and the radiation-to-liver contrast-to-noise ratio (C/N) was improved. Postcontrast T2*-weighted images showed the highest C/N. In the late phase, the irradiated areas showed high intensity on T2-weighted images and low intensity on T1-weighted images without SPIO, while high intensity on T1-weighted images with SPIO. The C/N increased with SPIO in all sequences and postcontrast T2-weighted images showed the highest C/N in the late phase. SPIO-enhanced MRI is useful to evaluate this entity both in the early and late phase of clinical studies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
1137,"A review of the effects of uranium and depleted uranium exposure on reproduction and fetal development Depleted uranium (DU) is used in armor-penetrating munitions, military vehicle armor, and aircraft, ship and missile counterweighting/ballasting, as well as in a number of other military and commercial applications. Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded
2070,"Efficacy of narrowband UVB vs. PUVA in patients with early-stage mycosis fungoides INTRODUCTION: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of the skin that often begins as limited patches and plaques with slow progression to systemic involvement. Narrowband ultraviolet (UV) B therapy has been proven to be an effective short-term treatment modality for clearing patch-stage MF. The effect of psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet A (PUVA) in the treatment of patch- and plaque-type MF has also been thoroughly documented., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of narrowband UVB and PUVA in patients with early-stage MF., METHODS: We analysed the response to treatment, relapse-free survival and irradiation dose in 114 patients with histologically confirmed early-stage MF (stage IA, IB and IIA)., RESULTS: A total of 95 patients were treated with PUVA (83.3%) and 19 with narrowband UVB (16.7%). With PUVA, 59 patients (62.1%) had a complete response (CR), 24 (25.3%) had a partial response (PR) and 12 (12.6%) had a failed response. Narrowband UVB led to CR in 12 (68.4%) patients, PR in 5 (26.3%) patients and a failed response in 1 (5.3%) patient. There were no differences in terms of time to relapse between patients treated with PUVA and those treated with narrowband UVB (11.5 vs. 14.0 months respectively; P = 0.816). No major adverse reactions were attributed to the treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that phototherapy is a safe, effective and well-tolerated, first-line therapy in patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, with prolonged disease-free remissions being achieved. It suggests that narrowband UVB is at least as effective as PUVA for treatment of early-stage MF.",Excluded
2076,"Rapid High-Throughput Diagnostic Triage after a Mass Radiation Exposure Event Using Early Gene Expression Changes Radiological exposure scenarios involving large numbers of people require a rapid and high-throughput method to identify the unexposed, and those exposed to low- and high-dose radiation. Those with high-dose exposure, e.g., >2 Gy and depending on host characteristics, may develop severe hematological acute radiation syndrome (HARS), requiring hospitalization and treatment. Previously, we identified a set of genes that discriminated these clinically relevant groups. In the current work, we examined the utility of gene expression changes to classify 1,000 split blood samples into HARS severity scores of H0, H1 and H2-4, with the latter indicating likely hospitalization. In several previous radiation dose experiments, we determined that these HARS categories corresponded, respectively, to doses of 0 Gy (unexposed), 0.5 Gy and 5 Gy. The main purpose of this work was to assess the rapidity of blood sample processing using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). Peripheral blood samples from two healthy donors were X-ray irradiated in vitro and incubated at 37degreeC for 24 h. A total of 1,000 samples were evaluated by laboratory personnel blinded to the radiation dose. Changes in gene expression of FDXR, DDB2, POU2AF1 and WNT3 were examined with qRT-PCR as positive controls. Targeted NGS (TREX) was used on all samples for the same four genes. Agreement using both methods was almost 78%. Using NGS, all 1,000 samples were processed within 30 h. Classification of the HARS severity categories corresponding to radiation dose had an overall agreement ranging between 90-97%. Depending on the end point, either a combination of all genes or FDXR alone (H0 HARS or unexposed) provided the best classification. Using this optimized automated methodology, we assessed 100x more samples approximately three times faster compared to standard cytogenetic studies. We showed that a small set of genes, rather than a complex constellation of genes, provided robust positive (97%) and negative (97%) predictive values for HARS categories and radiation doses of 0, 0.5 and 5 Gy. The findings of this study support the potential utility of early radiation-induced gene expression changes for high-throughput biodosimetry and rapid identification of irradiated persons in need of hospitalization.",Excluded
2247,"Association between SNPs in defined functional pathways and risk of early or late toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pathways involved in the ROS pathway, DNA repair, or TGFB1 signaling on acute or late normal toxicity as well as individual radiosensitivity., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients receiving breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy were examined either for erythema (n = 83), fibrosis (n = 123), or individual radiosensitivity (n = 123). The 17 SNPs analyzed are involved in the ROS pathway (GSTP1, SOD2, NQO1, NOS3, XDH), DNA repair (XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC6, ERCC2, LIG4, ATM) or TGFB signaling (SKIL, EP300, APC, AXIN1, TGFB1). Associations with biological and clinical endpoints were studied for single SNPs but especially for combinations of SNPs assuming that a SNP is either beneficial or deleterious and needs to be weighted., RESULTS: With one exception, no significant association was seen between a single SNP and the three endpoints studied. No significant associations were also observed when applying a multi-SNP model assuming that each SNP was deleterious. In contrast, significant associations were obtained when SNPs were suggested to be either beneficial or deleterious. These associations increased, when each SNP was weighted individually. Detailed analysis revealed that both erythema and individual radiosensitivity especially depend on SNPs affecting DNA repair and TGFB1 signaling, while SNPs in ROS pathway were of minor importance., CONCLUSION: Functional pathways of SNPs may be used to form a risk score allowing to predict acute and late radiation-induced toxicity but also to unravel the underlying biological mechanisms.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional ethics committee approved this study. After imformed consent was obtained, twenty-three patients suffering from a total of 65 HCC lesions were treated with I-125 seed permanent interstitial implantation under the guidance of a 1.5 T conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The FSE T2WI, T1 FSPGR, FIESTA 2D, 3D Dyn T1WI sequences were used to guide an 18G MR-compatible needle inserted into the lesions to introduce the I-125 seeds. The response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) were used to evaluate the curative effect. Result(s): The needle and I-125 seed were seen clearly on MRI images. The final dose delivered to total decay was 173.46 +/- 32.44 Gy (range, 110-270 Gy) as calculated by postoperative TPS. The complete response (CR) was seen in 22 lesions (33.8%), partial response (PR) in 24 lesions (36.9%), stable disease (SD) in 9 lesions (13.8%), and progressive disease (PD) in 10 lesions (15.4%).

The purpose of this study was to report on patterns of palliative RT of bone metastasis in a severely low-capacity setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patient and treatment characteristics of patients irradiated for palliation of symptomatic bone metastasis were extracted from a retrospective database of patients treated between May 2015 and January 2018. This database included a random sample of 1,823 of the estimated 4,000 patients who were treated with RT within in the study period. Associations between the applied RT schedule and patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated with the chi2 test. Hypothetical savings of RT sessions and time were compared in the case of a single-fraction policy. RESULTS From the database, 234 patients (13%) were treated for bone metastasis. Most patients were <= 65 years of age (n = 189; 80%) and female (n = 125; 53%). The most common primary sites were breast (n = 82; 35%) and prostate (n = 36; 15%). Fractionated regimens were preferred over single fraction: 20 Gy in 5 fractions (n = 192; 82.1%), 30 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 7; 3%), and 8 Gy in 1 fraction (n = 28; 12%). Factors associated with single-fraction RT included nonaxial sites of bone metastasis (P, .01) and an address outside Addis Ababa (P <= .01). If single-fraction RT would have been given uniformly for bone metastasis, this would have resulted in a 78% reduction in the number of RT sessions and 76% reduction in total RT time. CONCLUSION The pattern of palliative RT for bone metastasis in Ethiopia favors fractionated regimens over single fraction. Efforts should be made to adopt evidence-based and cost-effective guidelines.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded
2133,"Corneal Nerve and Epithelial Cell Alterations in Corneal Allodynia: An In Vivo Confocal Microscopy Case Series Purpose To investigate morphological changes of the corneal epithelium and subbasal nerves in patients with corneal allodynia using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Design Case-control study of patients with corneal allodynia and healthy controls. Methods Ten eyes of six patients were diagnosed with corneal allodynia at a single center and compared to fifteen healthy eyes. IVCM of the central cornea was performed on all subjects and controls. Images were retrospectively analyzed numbers of total corneal subbasal nerves, main trunks and branches, total nerve length and density, nerve branching, and tortuosity, superficial and basal epithelial cell densities, and superficial epithelial cell size. Results Corneal allodynia was seen in patients with dry eye disease, recurrent corneal erosion syndrome, exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and Accutane use. Compared to controls, patients with corneal allodynia had a significant decrease in the total numbers of subbasal nerves (P=.014), nerve branches (P=.006), total nerve length (P=.0029), total nerve density (P=.0029) and superficial and basal epithelial cell densities (P=.0004, P=.0036) with an increase in superficial epithelial cell size (P=.016). There were no statistically significant differences in the number of subbasal nerve main trunks (P=.09), nerve branching (P=.21), and nerve tortuosity (P=.05). Conclusions Corneal IVCM enables near-histological visualization and quantification of the cellular and neural changes in corneal allodynia. Regardless of etiology, corneal allodynia is associated with decreased corneal epithelial cell densities, increased epithelial cell size, and decreased numbers and lengths of subbasal nerves despite an unremarkable slit-lamp examination. Therefore, IVCM may be useful in the management of patients with corneal allodynia.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
690,"Comparison of Machine Learning Optimal Classification Trees With the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network Head Trauma Decision Rules Importance: Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is the standard for the rapid diagnosis of intracranial injury, but it is costly and exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rules for identifying children with minor head trauma who are at very low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) are widely used to triage CT imaging. Objective: To examine whether optimal classification trees (OCTs), which are novel machine-learning classifiers, improve on PECARN rules' predictive accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants: A secondary analysis of prospective, publicly available data on emergency department visits for head trauma used by the PECARN group to develop their tool was conducted to derive OCT-based prediction rules for ciTBI in a development cohort and compare their predictive performance vs the PECARN rules in a validation cohort among children who were younger than 2 years and 2 years or older. Data on 42412 children with head trauma and without severely altered mental status who were examined between June 1, 2004, and September 30, 2006, were gathered from 25 emergency departments in North America participating in PECARN. Data analysis was conducted from September 15, 2016, to December 18, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcome was ciTBI, with predictive performance measured by estimating the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio for the OCT and the PECARN rules. The OCT and PECARN rules' performance was compared by estimating ratios for each measure. Results: Of the 42412 children (15 996 [37.7%] girls) included in the analysis, 10718 were younger than 2 years (25.3%; mean [SD] age, 11.6 [0.6] months) and 31694 were 2 years or older (74.7%; age, 9.1 [4.9] years). Compared with PECARN rules, OCTs misclassified 0 vs 1 child with ciTBI in the younger and 10 vs 9 children with ciTBI in the older cohort, and correctly identified more children with very low risk of ciTBI in the younger (7605 vs 5701) and older (20 594 vs 18 134) cohorts. In the validation cohorts, compared with the PECARN rules, the OCTs had statistically significantly better specificity (in the younger cohort: 69.3%; 95% CI, 67.4%-71.2% vs 52.8%; 95% CI, 50.8%-54.9%; in the older cohort: 65.6%; 95% CI, 64.5%-66.8% vs 57.6%; 95% CI, 56.4%-58.8%), positive predictive value (odds ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively), and positive likelihood ratio (risk ratios, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.36-1.74 and 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30, in younger and older children, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity, negative predictive value, and negative likelihood ratio between the 2 sets of rules. Conclusions and Relevance: If implemented, OCTs may help reduce the number of unnecessary CT scans, without missing more patients with ciTBI than the PECARN rules.",Excluded
1150,"The age-dependent effect of high-dose X-ray radiation on NFkappaB signaling, structure, and mechanical behavior of the intervertebral disc Purpose: Ionizing radiation damages tissue and provokes inflammatory responses in multiple organ systems. We investigated the effects of high-dose X-ray radiation on the molecular inflammation and mechanical function of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Methods: Functional spine units (FSUs) containing the vertebrae-IVDs-vertebrae structure extracted from 1-month, 6-month, and 16-month-old NFkappaB-luciferase reporter mice and from 6-month-old myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-null mice. After a preconditioning period in culture, the FSUs were subjected a single dose of ionizing X-ray radiation at 20 Gys, and then NFkappaB expression was monitored. The IVDs were then subjected to mechanical testing using dynamic compression, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, and histological analyses. Results: In the 1-month-old FSUs, the NFkappaB-driven luciferase activity was significantly elevated for 1 day following the exposure to radiation. The 6-month-old FSUs showed increased NFkappaB activity for 3 days, while the 16-month-old FSUs sustained elevated levels of NFkappaB activity throughout the 10-day culture period. All irradiated groups showed significant loss of disc height, GAG content, mechanical function and changes in structure. Ablation of MyD88 blunted the radiation-mediated NFkappaB signaling, and preserved GAG content, and the IVDs' structure and mechanical performance. Conclusions: These results suggest that high-dose radiation affects the IVDs' NFkappaB-dependent inflammatory processes that subsequently lead to functional deterioration. Blocking the transactivation potential of NFkappaB via MyD88 ablation preserved the structure and mechanical function of the FSUs. The long-term effects of radiation on IVD homeostasis should be considered in individuals susceptible to occupational and medical exposure.",Included
1263,"Imaging Findings Within the First 12 Months of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Purpose: To correlate the imaging findings of treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with explant pathology and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response. Methods and Materials: From 2007 to 2015, of 146 patients treated with liver SBRT for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage A hepatocellular carcinoma, 10 were identified with inclusion criteria and had regular interval follow-up magnetic resonance imaging/triple phase computed tomography and explant pathology or declining AFP values for radiology-pathology response correlation. Reference standards for successful response were >90% necrosis on explant pathology or pretreatment AFP >75 ng/mL normalizing to <10 ng/mL within 1 year after SBRT without other treatment. Subjects were treated with 24 to 50 Gy in 3 to 5 fractions. Multiphasic magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after SBRT was compared with pretreatment imaging by 2 expert radiologists. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Result(s): There were 10 subjects with 10 treated HCCs, classified as 3 Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) 5a, 4 OPTN 5b, and 3 OPTN 5x. All had successfully treated HCCs, according to explant pathology or declining AFP. Four of 10 HCCs had persistent central arterial hyperenhancement 3 to 12 months after SBRT; persistent wash-out was common up to 12 months (9 of 10). Of 10 treated HCCs, 9 exhibited decreased size at 12 months. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the lesion showed early (3-6 months) hyperemia followed by late (6-12 months) capsular retraction and delayed enhancement. No patient had a significant decline in liver function. Conclusion(s): In the absence of increasing size, persistent central arterial hyperenhancement and wash-out can occur within the first 12 months after SBRT in successfully treated HCCs and may not represent residual viable tumor. Liver parenchyma adjacent to the treated lesion showed inflammation followed by fibrosis, without significant change in hepatic function. Until a radiologic signature of tumor control is determined, freedom from local progression seems to be the best measure of HCC control after SBRT.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2190,"Clinical efficacy of 2-phase versus 4-phase computed tomography for localization in primary hyperparathyroidism BACKGROUND: Four-dimensional computed tomography is being used increasingly for localization of abnormal glands in primary hyperparathyroidism. We hypothesized that compared with traditional 4-phase imaging, 2-phase imaging would halve the radiation dose without compromising parathyroid localization and clinical outcomes., METHODS: A transition from 4-phase to 2-phase imaging was instituted between 2009 and 2010. A pre-post analysis was performed on patients undergoing operative treatment with a parathyroid protocol computed tomography, and relevant data were correlated with operative findings. Sensitivity, positive predictive value, technical success, and cure rates were calculated. The Fisher exact test or chi(2) test assessed the significance of 2-phase and 4-phase imaging and operative findings., RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients had traditional four-dimensional computed tomography and 35 had modified 2-phase computed tomography. Effective radiation doses were 6.8 mSy for 2-phase and 14 mSv for 4-phase. Four-phase computed tomography had a sensitivity and positive predictive value of 93% and 96%, respectively. Two-phase computed tomography had a comparable sensitivity and positive predictive value of 97% and 94%, respectively. Eight patients with discordant imaging had an average parathyroid weight of 240 g compared with 1,300 g for all patients. Technical surgical success (90% for 4-phase computed tomography versus 91% 2-phase computed tomography) and normocalcemia rates at 6 months (88% for both) did not differ between computed tomography protocols. Computed tomography correctly predicted multiglandular disease and localization for reoperations in 88% and 90% of cases, respectively, with no difference by computed tomography protocol., CONCLUSION: With regard to surgical outcomes and localization, 2-phase parathyroid computed tomography is equivalent to 4-phase for parathyroid localization, including small adenomas, reoperative cases, and multiglandular disease. Two-phase parathyroid computed tomography for operative planning should be considered to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1496,"Decline of natural killer cell activity in sublethally irradiated mice Spleen cells of (C57BL/6 X C3H/He)F1 mice were assayed for natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 and FBL-3 lymphoma targets at several intervals after total-body exposure to a high sublethal dose of 137Cs or 60Co gamma-rays. NK cell activity did not decline for the first 12 days but decreased sharply thereafter and remained low until day 24. The recovery of splenic NK cell activity was delayed. Beginning on day 28, the activity was slowly increased, reaching near-normal levels (80% of controls) 41-59 days after irradiation. Suppressor cells detectable during the period of lowest NK cell activity, i.e., on days 17 and 19, may have been responsible for the delayed and slow recovery. These studies indicated that a) mature effectors of natural cytotoxicity are relatively radioresistant renewable cells with a lifespan of about 2 weeks whose progenitors are radiosensitive cells b) the kinetics of decline and especially of recovery of NK cell activity may be influenced by suppressor cells. Should NK cell activity confer resistance to autochthonous lymphomas in vivo, it may be a significant consideration for strategies of tumor therapy by cytotoxic agents that reconstitution of the NK cell pool is a slow process and that suppressor cell function must be overcome for full recovery.",Included
2541,"Long-term results of radiation therapy for pituitary adenoma Purpose. Local control for pituitary adenomas treated with external beam radiation therapy was retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of radiation. Materials and methods. Thirty-eight patients treated with radiation therapy between 1979 and 1994 were analyzed. The median age was 46. Nineteen newly diagnosed tumors were treated with surgery and radiation therapy, while the others were recurrent cases. Twenty-two tumors were non-functioning, while 10 produced growth hormone (GH) and three each were prolactin-, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-producing tumors. The median radiation dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Results. Non-functioning adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were completely controlled, judging from the absence of tumor progression on neuroimaging studies and clinical symptoms, and normalization of the serum prolactin level (< 25 ng/ml). On the other hand, local control was obtained in only one of the 3 patients with ACTH-producing adenomas, and the control rate at 10 years was only 46% for GH-producing adenomas. Panhypopituitarism developed in 35% of the patients after radiation therapy. No other serious complications were noted. Conclusion. Non-functioning pituitary adenomas and prolactin-producing adenomas were well controlled with external radiation therapy combined with surgery. However, dose escalation might be necessary to control GH- or ACTH-producing tumors. It is important to replace corticosteroid hormone and thyroid hormone in many patients.",Excluded
3075,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with capecitabine and sorafenib in patients with advanced KRAS-mutated rectal cancer: A phase I/II trial (SAKK 41/08) Background KRAS mutation occurs in ~40% of locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs). The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has radiosensitising effects and might improve outcomes for standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC. Methods Adult patients with KRAS-mutated T3/4 and/or N1/2M0 LARC were included in this phase I/II study. The phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine plus sorafenib and radiotherapy was followed by a phase II study assessing efficacy and safety. Primary end-points were to: establish the maximum tolerated dose of the regimen in phase I; determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in phase II defined as Dworak regression grade 3 and 4. Results Fifty-four patients were treated at 18 centres in Switzerland and Hungary; 40 patients were included in the single-arm phase II study. Recommended doses from phase I comprised radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily x 33 plus sorafenib 400 mg/d. Median daily dose intensity in phase II was radiotherapy 100%, capecitabine 98.6%, and sorafenib 100%. The pCR rate (Dworak 3/4) was 60% (95% CI, 43.3-75.1%) by central independent pathologic review. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 89.5%, R0 resection in 94.7%, and downstaging in 81.6%. The most common grade 3 toxicities during phase II included diarrhoea (15.0%), skin toxicity outside radiotherapy field (12.5%), pain (7.5%), skin toxicity in radiotherapy field, proctitis, fatigue and cardiac ischaemia (each 5%). Conclusions Combining sorafenib and standard chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine is highly active in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC with acceptable toxicity and deserves further investigation. www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00869570.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
2607,"Lower urinary tract function after intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy for invasive bladder cancer BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as a bladder-sparing regimen for invasive bladder cancer is highly promising for selected patients. However, lower urinary tract function after this treatment has not been fully investigated. METHOD(S): The urodynamic effects of intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy were retrospectively evaluated in 14 patients with organ-confined invasive bladder cancer. The post-treatment urodynamic findings were compared with the pretreatment ones (n = 7), and a comparison was made between the serial urodynamic findings after the treatment in another seven patients who were able to undergo the pretreatment urodynamic study (UDS). RESULT(S): The median follow-up period up to the latest UDS was 34 months. Of the 14 patients, the latest UDS revealed some storage dysfunctions in 11 (79%) and some emptying dysfunctions in three (23%). Uninhibited detrusor contraction and decreased bladder compliance were recorded in 29 and 43% at the pretreatment UDS and approximately 50-60 and 20-60% in the serial follow-up studies, respectively (n = 7). Impaired detrusor contractility lasted in one patient. In the seven patients without the pretreatment UDS, decreased maximum cystometric capacity and decreased compliance were recorded in approximately 50-60 and 20-60% at the serial UDS, respectively. Detrusor contractility was aggravated in one patient and completely lost in one with time. CONCLUSION(S): The urodynamic findings indicate that the bladder-sparing regimen might result in perpetuating the lower urinary tract dysfunctions due to invasive bladder cancer itself and/or transurethral surgery and might injure the infrasacral autonomic nerves and the bladder itself.",Excluded
1216,"Effect of combined misonidazole and accelerated neon ions on a human melanoma transplanted into nude mice The response to accelerated neon ions of human Nall melanomas growing in nude mice was measured by an in vitro colony-forming assay following in situ tumor irradiation in the midposition of a 10-cm extended-peak ionization region. Values of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for peak neon ions compared with 60Co gamma radiation were 3.2 and 3.4, respectively, at the 1% and 10% survival levels. Following irradiation with peak neon ions, the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLD) was comparable to that observed after gamma irradiation. When misonidazole (1 mg/g intraperitoneal dose) was administered in combination with extended-peak neon ions, the drug enhancement ratio (ER) at the 1% survival level was 1.5 if the tumors were removed and plated in vitro immediately following irradiation, and 1.9 if tumor excision and plating were delayed for greater than 6 hours. Administration of misonidazole completely inhibited PLD repair following either gamma irradiation or extended-peak neon-ion irradiation.",Included

Most post-radiotherapy NPC patients experience oropharyngeal dysphagia that results in pharyngeal residue. Pharyngeal residue is thought to be a risk factor for aspiration-penetration. Objective(s): Examining the correlation between pharyngeal residue and penetration-aspiration in postradiotherapy NPC patients. Method(s): Participants have been identified since 2018 to find out the total number of NPC patients. In the period January-October 2019, identification of NPC patients was performed according to participant criteria. Participants were examined for fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), pharyngeal residue using the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale (YPR-SRS), and penetration-aspiration using Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). Statistical tests were used Spearman correlation test with p<0.05. Result(s): The highest participant's pharyngeal residue appeared in vallecula when given soft bolus (96.55%), and in pyriform sinus when given thick liquid bolus (72.41%). Most participants with soft bolus had the highest negative penetration (72.59%) and positive penetration in thick liquid bolus (51.72%), while most had negative aspirations with the lowest value (89.66%). There is aspiration in 10.34% of patients when given a dilute liquid. There was a significant correlation between pharyngeal residue in vallecula and pyriform sinus with penetration-aspiration (p<0.05). There was a positive association with the use of soft bolus (r=0.623), thick liquid bolus (r=0.631), and dilute liquid bolus (r=0.891).

468,"The tumor-stroma ratio is an independent predictor for survival in nasopharyngeal cancer Background: The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) has been identified as a new and practicable prognostic histological characteristic of solid tumors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the TSR in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Patients and Methods: A total of 93 patients who presented with NPC from 2004 to 2007 were studied. Radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy was administered according to their Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages. The TSR was assessed visually on hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections of biopsy specimens by 2 independent observers. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 66.67% and 54.91%, respectively, in the stroma-poor group and 40.48% and 33.33%, respectively, in the stroma-rich group. Both the 5-year OS and DFS rates in the stroma-poor group were significantly better than those in the stroma-rich group (p < 0.05). In a multivariate analysis, the TSR was identified as a highly significant prognostic factor for the 5-year OS (hazard ratio (HR) 1.999; p = 0.030) and the 5-year DFS (HR 1.925; p = 0.042).

1491,"Effects of variable power on tissue ablation dynamics during magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy with the Visualase system Purpose: Magnetic resonance-guided laser-induced thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various intracranial pathologies. This study investigated the effects of variable power on maximal estimated thermal damage during ablation and duration required to reach maximal ablation. Materials/Methods: All ablations were performed using the Visualase Thermal Therapy System (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota), which uses a 980 nm diffusing tip diode laser. Cases were stratified into low, medium and high power. Maximal thermal damage estimate (TDEmax) achieved in a single plane and time to reach maximal damage (ttdemax) were measured and compared between groups using a 2x3 Fixed Factor Analysis of Covariance. Ablation area change for cases in which an initial thermal dose was followed by a subsequent dose, with increased power, was also assessed. Result(s): We used real-time ablation data from 93 patients across various intracranial pathologies. ttdemax (mean +/- SEM) decreased linearly as power increased (low: 139.2 +/- 10.4 s, medium: 127.5 +/- 4.3 s, high: 103.7 +/- 5.8 s). In cases where a second thermal dose was delivered at higher power, the TDE expanded an average of 51.4 mm2 beyond the initial TDE generated by the first ablation, with the second ablation approaching TDEmax at a higher rate than the initial ablation. Conclusion(s): Increased power results in a larger TDEmax and an increased ablation rate. In cases where an initial thermal dose does not fully ablate the target lesion, a second ablation at higher power can increase the area of ablation with an increased ablation rate.Copyright © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
1071,"Biopsy of pleural thickenings with pocket size ultrasound device Introduction:Pleural pathology diagnosis is based on the collection of cytological and histological samples. The use of image techniques is becoming more popular to increase accuracy and safety. TAC-guided thoracic biopsy is the most commonly used method but thoracic ultrasound offers some advantages like: absence of ionizing radiations and bedside exploration. Our aim was to analyze effectiveness and safety of the ultrasound-guided pleural biopsies using a pocket size ultrasound device (PSUD). Method(s): A prospective, one-year study from January 2016 to January 2017 was carried out. We included all patients with pleural thickening greater than 3 mm. Pleural biopsy was performed with a 14G gauge automatic needle (Acecut. TSK). Biopsy was completely echo-guided. Result(s):The samples were tagged as adequate sample (AS) or non-adequate sample (NAS) depending on the presence of mesothelium evidenced by the pathologist. Adequate samples (AS) were also tagged as diagnostic samples (DAS) or non-diagnostic samples (NDAS). We enrolled 32 patients. 68.8% were males, mean age of 53 (ED: 31). Biopsy was performed without need of hospitalization in 50 % of the cases. We obtained 26 AS (84.4%). 96.4% of them were diagnostic (DAS). Only one case showed further evidence of pleural involvement in a negative biopsy (mediastinal pleura). The only complication in all the biopsies performed was a pneumothorax without clinical repercussion in a pleural nodule biopsy without pleural effusion.

54,"Effects on human skin of repetitive ultraviolet-A1 (UVA1) irradiation and visible light Background: Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) has a variety of effects on human skin. Best known are the effects of UVB (290-320 nm) and UVA2 (320-340 nm), which cause DNA damage and increased risk of cancer. However, the effects of UVA1 (340-400 nm) have been not completely investigated. Method(s): The effects of repetitive low doses of UVA1 and visible light were studied in 12 healthy individuals. A part of the buttock was exposed to 20 J/cm2 UVA1 and another part to 126 J/cm2 of visible light three times a week for 4 weeks. Repeated punch biopsies were taken during the 4 weeks of treatment and also 2 weeks after the last irradiation. The avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique was used to investigate the expression of p53, p21WAF, bcl-2, Ki67 and cyclin A. Result(s): By comparison to untreated skin, an increased expression of p53 but not p21WAF in keratinocytes was seen. The bcl-2 protein expression increased slightly after both UVA1 and visible light. An increased staining with Ki67 and cyclin A after UVA1 but not after visible light was observed as a sign of increased proliferation. Conclusion(s): These results suggest that suberythemal doses of UVA1 and even visible light may cause DNA damage.",Excluded
876,"Evaluation of [18F]Mefway biodistribution and dosimetry based on whole-body PET imaging of mice PURPOSE: [(18)F]Mefway is a novel radiotracer specific to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor class. In preparation for using this tracer in humans, we have performed whole-body PET studies in mice to evaluate the biodistribution and dosimetry of [(18)F]Mefway.
METHODS: Six mice (three females and three males) received IV injections of [(18)F]Mefway and were scanned for 2 h in an Inveon-dedicated PET scanner. Each animal also received a high-resolution CT scan using an Inveon CT. The CT images were used to draw volume of interest on the following organs: the brain, large intestine, stomach, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, bone, spleen, testes, thymus, gallbladder, uterus, and urinary bladder. All organ time-activity curves without decay correction were normalized to the injected activity. The area under the normalized curves was then used to compute the residence times in each organ. Data were analyzed using PMOD and Matlab software. The absorbed doses in mouse organs were computed using the RAdiation Dose Assessment Resource animal models for dose assessment. The residence times in mouse organs were converted to human values using scale factors based on differences between organ and body weights. OLINDA/EXM 1.1 software was used to compute the absorbed human doses in multiple organs for both female and male phantoms.
RESULTS: The highest mouse residence times were found in the liver, urinary bladder, and kidneys. The largest doses in mice were found in the urinary bladder (critical organ), kidney, and liver for both females and males, indicating primary elimination via urinary system. The projected human effective doses were 1.21E - 02 mSv/MBq for the adult female model and 1.13E - 02 mSv/MBq for the adult male model. The estimated human biodistribution of [(18)F]Mefway was similar to that of [(11)C]WAY 100,635, a 5-HT1A tracer for which dosimetry has been evaluated in humans.
CONCLUSIONS: The elimination of radiotracer was primarily via the kidney and urinary bladder with the urinary bladder being the critical organ. Whole-body mouse imaging can be used as a preclinical tool to provide initial estimates of the absorbed doses of [(18)F]Mefway in humans.",Excluded
2928,"Comparison of safety and effectiveness between the right and left radial artery approach in percutaneous coronary intervention Introduction and objectives: There is a paucity of data comparing the left radial approach (LRA) and right radial approach (RRA) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in all-comers populations and performed by operators with different experience levels. Thus, we sought to compare the safety and clinical outcomes of the RRA and LRA during PCI in ""real-world"" patients with either stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Method(s): To overcome the possible impact of the nonrandomized design, a propensity score was calculated to compare the 2 radial approaches. The study group comprised 18 716 matched pairs with stable angina and 46 241 with ACS treated with PCI and stent implantation between 2014 and 2017 in 151 tertiary invasive cardiology centers in Poland (the ORPKI Polish National Registry). Result(s): The rates of death and periprocedural complications were similar for the RRA and LRA in stable angina patients. A higher radiation dose was observed with PCI via the LRA in both clinical presentations (stable angina: 1067.0 +/- 947.1 mGy vs 1007.4 +/- 983.5 mGy, P = .001; ACS: 1212.7 +/- 1005.5 mGy vs 1053.5 +/- 1029.7 mGy, P = .001). More contrast was used in LRA procedures but only in ACS patients (174.2 +/- 75.4 mL vs 167.2 +/- 72.1 mL, P = .001). Furthermore, periprocedural complications such as coronary artery dissection (0.16% vs 0.09%, P = .008), no-reflow phenomenon (0.65% vs 0.49%, P = .005), and puncture site bleeding (0.09% vs 0.05%, P = .04) were more frequently observed with the LRA in ACS patients. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups (P = .90). Conclusion(s): Our finding of poorer outcomes with the LRA may be related to lower operator experience with this approach. While both the LRA and RRA are safe in the setting of stable angina, the LRA was associated with a higher rate of periprocedural complications during PCI in ACS patients.

339,"Prediction of survival by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing definitive chemoradiation therapy: results of the ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 trial In this prospective National Cancer Institute-funded American College of Radiology Imaging Network/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group cooperative group trial, we hypothesized that standardized uptake value (SUV) on post-treatment [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) correlates with survival in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients received conventional concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy without surgery; postradiotherapy consolidation chemotherapy was allowed. Post-treatment FDG-PET was performed at approximately 14 weeks after radiotherapy. SUVs were analyzed both as peak SUV (SUVpeak) and maximum SUV (SUVmax; both institutional and central review readings), with institutional SUVpeak as the primary end point. Relationships between the continuous and categorical (cutoff) SUVs and survival were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards multivariate models. Of 250 enrolled patients (226 were evaluable for pretreatment SUV), 173 patients were evaluable for post-treatment SUV analyses. The 2-year survival rate for the entire population was 42.5%. Pretreatment SUVpeak and SUVmax (mean, 10.3 and 13.1, respectively) were not associated with survival. Mean post-treatment SUVpeak and SUVmax were 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. Post-treatment SUVpeak was associated with survival in a continuous variable model (hazard ratio, 1.087; 95% CI, 1.014 to 1.166; P = .020). When analyzed as a prespecified binary value (<= v > 3.5), there was no association with survival. However, in exploratory analyses, significant results for survival were found using an SUVpeak cutoff of 5.0 (P = .041) or 7.0 (P < .001). All results were similar when SUVmax was used in univariate and multivariate models in place of SUVpeak. Higher post-treatment tumor SUV (SUVpeak or SUVmax) is associated with worse survival in stage III NSCLC, although a clear cutoff value for routine clinical use as a prognostic factor is uncertain at this time.",Excluded
2334,"Radiographic joint damage and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients: 20 years survival study Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased mortality and reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. This mortality gap has increased in the last years since mortality rates for RA have remained constant throughout time while mortality rates for the general population have decline. Excess mortality has been associated with disease activity. Radiographic joint destruction reflects the cumulative burden of inflammation and it is conceived as an objective measure of RA severity. Objectives The objective of our study is to analyze the influence of radiological joint damage in the mortality rate in a cohort of RA patients. Methods We included 783 RA patients in a retrospective longitudinal study, from May 1993 to November 2013, attending the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid, Spain). Subjects were included at the moment of their first X-ray, until October 2012, and followed until patients' death, loss of follow up or November 2013. Clinical records were examined and demographic and clinical data was collected. Radiographic joint damage of hands and wrists was assessed with the Sharp vand-der-Heijde score [total (SHS), erosion (ES) and narrowing/(sub)luxation (NSLS) components]. Survival techniques were applied to estimate the mortality rate (MR; expressed per 1000 patients-years with a 95% of Confidence Interval [95% CI]). Cox bivariate and multivariate regression models were conducted to examine risk factors for death. Interaction terms between radiological damage and rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, and the elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, were introduce in the models. Proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Results Most of the patients included were women (74%), with a median age of 61 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 47-71), 67% were RF positive, and the median (IQR) elapsed time between RA symptoms onset and the X-ray was 2 (0-7) years. The median (range) followed up time per patient was 5 [0.4-20] years. 92 patients died during a follow up time of 4758 person-years. Mortality rate was 19 per 1000 patient-year [95% CI 16-24]. We observed in the bivariate analysis that older age, male sex, higher elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, SHS, ES, NSLS, number of hospital admissions (used as a surrogate measure of comorbidity), basal Health Assessment Questionnaire, RF positivity, earlier RA onset (in calendar time), and no treatment with biological therapy, were associated with a higher MR. 3 multivariate models were constructed, using SHS, ES or NSLS as measures for joint destruction, and adjusted by the previous variables. In none of the models radiographic damage was associated with MR. However, we observed that the interaction between ES and RF positivity and with elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray were both significant (p=0.001, p=0.03, respectively): the lower elapsed time, the greater the effect of ES in the MR. On the other hand, ES was associated to MR only in RF negative patients. Conclusions Erosive joint damage seems to be a risk factor for all cause mortality among RF negative RA patients. Early radiographic damage seems to better predict mortality.",Excluded
435,"Assessment of Corneal Backward Light Scattering in Diabetic Patients OBJECTIVES: To analyze corneal backward light scattering differences in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus., METHODS: We enrolled 43 eyes from 43 diabetic patients and 40 eyes from 40 healthy controls. Corneal backward light scattering was evaluated using densitometry measurements from different corneal layers and zones obtained using Scheimpflug tomography (PentacamHR)., RESULTS: When densitometry values were divided by depth, anterior layer of diabetic corneas displayed significantly higher corneal backward light scattering values than controls (32.05, 95% confidence intervals [CI], 31.02-33.08 vs. 29.18, 95% CI, 27.60-30.76, P=0.024). Corneal densitometry measurements were also significantly higher in diabetic eyes compared with control eyes, when considered by concentric zones of total cornea in the 0 to 2 mm (21.65, 95% CI, 20.28-23.01 vs. 18.87 95% CI, 18.49-19.25, P=0.020), and anterior layer in the 0 to 2 mm (27.3, 95% CI, 25.04-29.56 vs. 22.31, 95% CI, 20.57-24.05, P<0.001), 2 to 6 mm (26.2, 95% CI, 24.99-27.41 vs. 22.4, 95% CI, 20.18-24.62, P<0.001) and 6 to 10 mm (32.19, 95% CI, 29.98-34.40 vs. 27.2, 95% CI, 25.39-29.01, P=0.022). There was excellent positive correlation between anterior total corneal densitometry measurements and duration of diabetes (r=0.802, P<0.001), although no significant correlation was observed with anterior total corneal densitometry measurements and hemoglobin A1c levels (r=0.080, P=0.621) in diabetic eyes., CONCLUSIONS: Backward light scattering values from the anterior layer of the cornea is greater in diabetic eyes than in controls. Anterior total corneal densitometry measurements show positive correlation with the duration of diabetes.",Excluded
638,"Dose-response study of intracoronary beta-radiation with 32P in balloon- and stent-injured coronary arteries in swine Purpose: A dose-response study was performed in swine to investigate the vascular effects of 32P over a broad range of doses in order to define the therapeutic window of intracoronary radiotherapy (ICR) with 32P. Methods and Materials: A total of 131 porcine arteries were subjected to balloon injury or stenting followed by 0-36 Gy of ICR from a centered 32P source wire to 1 mm beyond lumen surface or a sham ICR procedure. Animals were euthanized at 4 weeks, and vessels were harvested for histomorphometry. Result(s): In the balloon-injured arteries, doses of 7 and 9 Gy did not impact restenosis. At doses of 14-36 Gy, neointima was markedly reduced, with mild dilatation at the highest dose, 36 Gy. In the stent-injured arteries, the lowest dose of 9 Gy failed to reduce neointimal growth, while 14-26 Gy showed the most favorable response. Conclusion(s): ICR with 32P features a broad therapeutic window. Doses of 14-26 Gy to 1 mm beyond lumen surface provided an optimal combination of efficacy and safety. Doses of 7 and 9 Gy were generally ineffective, suggesting a minimum threshold for ICR with 32P to effectively inhibit restenosis. Copyright © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
2604,"Hepatic toxicity after radioembolization of the liver using 90Y-microspheres: Sequential lobar versus whole liver approach Purpose: 90Y-radioembolization (RE) is a promising technique for delivering high doses of radiation to liver tumors but may result in compromise of liver function. To gain further perspective, we evaluated the toxicity rates of sequential lobar versus whole liver 90Y-radioembolization. Method(s): Thirty-four patients with liver malignancy in noncirrhotic livers were included; 90Y-radioembolization was performed as either whole liver or sequential lobar treatment in 17 patients each. Standard clinical and liver specific laboratory parameters as well as MR imaging before treatment and at follow-up (6 and 12 weeks) after radioembolization were evaluated for toxicity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Volumetry of the liver, tumor, and spleen and measurement of portal vein diameter also were performed. Result(s): Three months after whole liver RE, 14 liver-related grade 3/4 events were recorded versus 2 events after sequential lobar treatment (P < 0.05). Three patients treated with whole liver RE suffered from radioembolization-induced liver disease (REILD). Pathological increases in bilirubin at 3 months were observed for the whole liver group only (52.3 vs. 18.7 mumol/l, P = 0.012). Total liver volume did not change significantly in either group, but shrinkage of the initially treated hepatic lobe with compensatory hypertrophy of the subsequently treated lobe was observed in the sequential lobar group (P < 0.05). Portal vein diameter increased significantly in whole liver-treated patients only (+17% vs. +6.6%, P = 0.043). Conclusion(s): Noncirrhotic patients undergoing sequential lobar radioembolization had less hepatic toxicity compared to whole liver embolization. The sequential approach should be the preferred strategy. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Excluded
1257,"Efficacy of sonography as a guidance technique for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes OBJECTIVE: In the United States, CT is generally considered the guidance technique of choice for biopsy of abdominal, pelvic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of sonography for this purpose., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We attempted 26 sonographically guided biopsies of five abdominal, six pelvic, and 12 retroperitoneal lymph nodes in 23 patients. The patients included 19 women and four men who were 26-76 years old (mean, 50 years old). The nodes were less than 2 cm in 16 patients, 2-3 cm in four patients, and greater than 3 cm in three patients. Biopsies were considered successful if the nodes could be visualized and biopsied using sonographic guidance and the pathologist's final report indicated that the tissue specimens obtained were adequate for diagnosis. The length of the procedures and the number of complications were recorded., RESULTS: Lymph nodes were visualized and biopsied with sonographic guidance in 23 (88%) of the 26 attempts. Three biopsies could not be performed with sonography because of poor visualization of the nodes. Adequate tissue for cytologic or histologic evaluation was obtained in 21 (91%) of the 23 sonographically guided procedures. In the 21 successful procedures, clinical and imaging follow-up showed no evidence of false-negative diagnoses. The time from the placement of the patient in the interventional sonography room to completion of the procedure ranged from 25 to 60 min (mean, 35 min) for sonographically guided biopsies. We had no procedure-related complications., CONCLUSION: Sonography is an accurate and safe guidance technique for lymph node biopsies in the abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum. This technique is efficacious for deep nodes as small as 1 cm in diameter. The advantages of sonography over CT include no need for ionizing radiation, portability, shorter procedure time, and real-time visualization of the needle throughout the procedure. These advantages, and the fact that sonography costs less than CT, suggest that sonography is a more appropriate guidance technique in this era of cost containment.",Excluded
3192,"Raw data-based iterative reconstruction in body CTA: evaluation of radiation dose saving potential OBJECTIVE: To evaluate prospectively, in patients undergoing body CTA, the radiation dose saving potential of raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to filtered back projection (FBP)., METHODS: Twenty-five patients underwent thoraco-abdominal CTA with 128-slice dual-source CT, operating both tubes at 120 kV. Full-dose (FD) images were reconstructed with FBP and were compared to half-dose (HD) images with FBP and HD-images with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE), both reconstructed using data from only one tube-detector-system. Image quality and sharpness of the aortic contour were assessed. Vessel attenuation and noise were measured, contrast-to-noise-ratio was calculated., RESULTS: Noise as image quality deteriorating artefact occurred in 24/25 (96%) HD-FBP but not in FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction datasets (p < 0.001). Other artefacts occurred with similar prevalence among the datasets. Sharpness of the aortic contour was higher for FD-FBP and HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction as compared to HD-FBP (p < 0.001). Aortoiliac attenuation was similar among all datasets (p > 0.05). Lowest noise was found for HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (7.23HU), being 9.4% lower than that in FD-FBP (7.98HU, p < 0.05) and 30.8% lower than in HD-FBP images (10.44HU, p < 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio was lower in HD-FBP (p < 0.001) and higher in HD-raw data-based iterative reconstruction (p < 0.001) as compared to FD-FBP., CONCLUSION: Intra-individual comparisons of image quality of body CTA suggest that raw data-based iterative reconstruction allows for dose reduction >50% while maintaining image quality. Key Points * Raw data-based iterative reconstruction reduces image noise and improves image quality as compared to filtered back projection * At a similar radiation dose, raw data-based iterative reconstruction improves the sharpness of vessel contours * In body CTA a dose reduction of >50% might be possible when using raw data-based iterative reconstructions, while image quality can be maintained.",Excluded
2577,"[Acquisition of age- and sex-dependent patient data for the calculation of annual radiation exposure in nuclear medicine: a German pilot study] AIM: A pilot study for estimation of radiation exposure due to diagnostic procedures in nuclear medicine using routine data of hospitals and practices in Germany., METHODS: Hospitals and practices willing to participate in the study supplied data of one year (1997), containing information on patients' identification number, age, sex, type of diagnostic procedure, radiopharmaceutical, administered activity, type of health insurance (private/public), inpatient/outpatient status, and so-called Leistungsziffer, which describes the type of medical performances in Germany. The effective dose per examination was calculated according to ICRP 80. Mean, standard deviation, median, 5th and 95th percentiles of the effective dose were calculated, stratified by type of organ system and also by sex and age, including patients of > or = 18 years., RESULTS: 82,039 examinations from patients of 9 hospitals and practices were analyzed. The median (5-95(th) percentiles) of the effective dose per examination for all patients was 2.9 mSv (0.4-8.5 mSv); 1.2 examinations per patient and year were performed on average. The three most frequent examinations were bone scans (median 3.4 mSv; 2.9-5.1), thyroid (0.9 mSv; 0.4-2.2) and cardiovascular studies (7.3 mSv; 3.8-20.2). The median effective dose for 18 to 40 years old women was 1.0 mSv (0.4-5.8), for women between 41 and 65 years 2.2 mSv (0.4-7.3) and for women older than 65 years 2.4 mSv (0.5-7.6). The corresponding values for men were 2.6 mSv (0.3-7.6); 3.3 mSv (0.4-9.1), and 3.4 mSv (0.5-8.8)., CONCLUSION: It was possible to gain an accurate determination of radiation exposure of diagnostic procedures in nuclear medicine by routine data.",Excluded
3198,"Retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma: low-dose neoadjuvant radiation therapy followed by surgery with or without intraoperative radiotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy Background: We describe the clinical history, outcome, and toxicity of five patients with high-grade retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS) who were treated with neoadjuvant low-dose radiotherapy (RT) followed by resection with or without intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), followed by adjuvant RT. We aim to provide additional evidence for the various treatment options that exist for this rare tumor entity. Method(s): Most patients presented with mild abdominal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Additional imaging was done by sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). All patients were treated with neoadjuvant RT of 19.8Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions followed by resection and postoperative RT up to 45Gy with a median interval between resection and start of postoperative RT of 5 weeks. Two patients received additional IORT. Median follow-up was 61 months. Result(s): One patient developed a local recurrence that was diagnosed 30 months after the start of the first therapy. He was treated with a salvage resection and had no evidence of disease at the last follow-up. Another patient developed a right-sided RSTS on the contralateral side from the primary radiation field with pelvic bone infiltration 56 months after the start of RT. He was treated again by RT and resection and was without evidence of disease at last follow-up. Radiotherapy was well tolerated without major toxicity. Conclusion(s): The treatment of RSTS by low-dose neoadjuvant RT, resection with IORT and adjuvant RT seems to be a feasible and effective treatment approach. Further studies comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant RT are necessary to find the best treatment option.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): In 36 patients (4 female, 32 male, mean age 65 years; range 33 88) with a pulmonary nodule, we performed CT-guided biopsy using a 18G Tru-cut needle (Cardinal Health, Dublin, UK) in a 64 row dual-source CT scanner (Somatom Definition, Siemens, Forchheim, Germany) using intermittent imaging of the needle. In half of the patients (2 female, 16 male, mean age 67 years), an interactive breath-hold control system (IBC) (Mayo Clinic Medical Devices, USA) was applied. No additional device was used in the control group. Result(s): The biopsy was visually successful in all patients. The diameter of the target lesion was comparable in both groups (IBC: 30 +/- 19 mm; control: 28 +/- 15 mm). The number of imaging steps was significantly smaller (p < 0.05) and the intervention time was significantly shorter (p < 0.05) in the IBC group (IBC: 9 +/- 5 steps 17 +/- 10 min; control: 13 +/- 5 steps 26 +/- 12 min).

270,"Automated synthesis and dosimetry of 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF): A radiotracer for imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer 6-Deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-D-fructose (6-[18F]FDF) is a promising PET radiotracer for imaging GLUT5 in breast cancer. The present work describes GMP synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF in an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and dosimetry calculations to determine radiation doses in humans. GMP synthesis and dosimetry calculations are important prerequisites for first-in-human clinical studies of 6-[18F]FDF. The radiochemical synthesis of 6-[18F]FDF was optimized and adapted to an automated synthesis process using a Tracerlab FXFN ASU (GE Healthcare). Starting from 30 GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride, 2.9 +/- 0.1 GBq of 6-[18F]FDF could be prepared within 50 min including HPLC purification resulting in an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14 +/- 3% (n = 11). Radiochemical purity exceeded 95%, and the specific activity was greater than 5.1 GBq/mumol. Sprague-Dawley rats were used for biodistribution experiments, and dynamic and static small animal PET experiments. Biodistribution studies served as basis for allometric extrapolation to the standard man anatomic model and normal organ-absorbed dose calculations using OLINDA/EXM software. The calculated human effective dose for 6-[18F]FDF was 0.0089 mSv/MBq. Highest organ doses with a dose equivalent of 0.0315 mSv/MBq in a humans were found in bone. Injection of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of 6-[18F]FDF results in an effective whole body radiation dose of 3.3 mSv in humans, a value comparable to that of other 18F-labeled PET radiopharmaceuticals. The optimized automated synthesis under GMP conditions, the good radiochemical yield and the favorable human radiation dosimetry estimates support application of 6-[18F]FDF in clinical trials for molecular imaging of GLUT5 in breast cancer patients.",Excluded

Median age at RT was 76 years (range 30-92), including 27 patients (41%) aged >= 80 years. Median RT dose was 58.05 Gy (range 37.5-67.5), all delivered in 15 daily fractions. Thirty-two patients received proton RT and 34 patients received photon RT., RESULTS: Median follow-up times from diagnosis and RT start were 21 months and 14 months, respectively. In total, five patients (7.6%) developed local failure. The 2-year outcomes were 84% local control (LC) and 58% OS. Among the 51 patients treated with definitive intent, the 2-year LC rate was 93% and the OS rate was 62%. On multivariate analysis for LC, older age was associated with a lower risk of local failure [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91; p = 0.02], while prior surgery (HR 16.5; p = 0.04) and macrovascular invasion (HR 123.93; p = 0.02) were independently associated with an increased risk of local failure. On multivariate analysis for OS, female sex (HR 0.33; p = 0.001) and prior chemotherapy (HR 0.38; p = 0.003) remained significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis for OS, compared with photon RT, there was a trend towards improved survival with proton RT (HR 0.50; p = 0.05). The rate of overall grade 3 + toxicity was 11%. One patient developed radiation-induced liver disease and was treated with corticosteroids., CONCLUSIONS: HF-RT yields high rates of local control and is an effective modality to optimize biliary control for unresectable/locally recurrent ICC.",Excluded
3330,"The in situ repair kinetics of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in human skin types I and II We assessed the in situ time-dependent loss of epidermal thymine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in skin types I and II after exposure to two minimal erythema doses of solar-simulating radiation on previously unexposed buttock skin. Using quantitative image analysis, we evaluated biopsy sections stained with monoclonal antibodies. We then made comparisons, in the same volunteers, with unscheduled DNA synthesis, which is a direct marker of overall excision repair. Removal of thymine dimers was slow (half-life = 33.3 h), with high levels of lesions still present 24 h post-irradiation; some lesions were still present at 7 d. In contrast, removal of 6-4 photoproducts was rapid (half-life = 2.3 h), the decay kinetics of which correlated better with the decline in epidermal unscheduled DNA synthesis (half-life = 7.1 h). These data show that as in mouse, monkey, and in vitro models, the 6-4 photolesion is repaired preferentially in human epidermis in situ. They also raise the possibility that poor thymine dimer repair may be a feature of skin types I and II, who are more prone to skin cancer than are types III and IV. There was an inverse relationship between the onset of erythema and 6-4 photoproduct repair, suggesting that this repair process initiates erythema.",Excluded
282,"Isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis by use of 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine-treated cells Irradiated McCoy cells have provided a useful technique for the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis strains, among which are found the etiological agents of trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded
1050,"Influence of chronic UV exposure and lifestyle on facial skin photo-aging--results from a pilot study In order to better understand the effect of chronic sun exposure on facial skin photo-aging and to identify the factors affecting it, we planned a study in two areas in Japan, Akita and Kagoshima, which correspond to the low and high sun exposure environments, respectively. As a first step, we conducted a pilot study in the two areas, examining 195 subjects. Hyper-pigmentation and wrinkling were measured with a high-resolution digital video imaging system. As expected, people in Kagoshima had darker skin, higher visual grades of facial hyper-pigmentation, and more facial wrinkles than people in Akita, reflecting the difference of UV exposure levels in the two areas. Both the grades of hyper-pigmentation and number of wrinkles increased in a roughly linear fashion with the advancement of age. On the other hand, the effect of gender was different in those two skin photo-aging parameters. Women had higher hyper-pigmentation grades (P = 0.012) and less wrinkles (P = 0.004) than men. Interestingly, post-menopausal women had higher grades of hyper-pigmentation than pre-menopausal women. Neither sun exposure index for darkness nor wrinkling showed any significant differences by menopausal status. In this pilot study, we collected information on various factors, including life-styles. The results of detail analysis will be presented elsewhere. In the present analysis, we found that the grade of hyper-pigmentation was not related to total hours spent outside in life but was affected by various factors, including toe-nail zinc levels. On the other hand, the number of wrinkles was significantly related to total hours spent outside in life. The most important risk factors of non-melanoma skin cancer are chronic sun exposure, age and male sex. All of them are strongly related to higher levels of UV exposure. The present study confirmed that chronic sun exposure, age and male sex were strong risk factors of the wrinkle number. The number of wrinkles was significantly related to total hours of sun exposure in life, increased in a roughly linear fashion with the advancement of age, and was larger in men than in women. In epidemiological studies of UV-related skin cancer, the number of wrinkles, which can be easily measured with a high-resolution digital video imaging system as shown in this study, may be a good marker of total sun exposure in life.",Excluded

At follow-up, visual memory performance had deteriorated, while verbal memory remained more stable.",Included
1803,"HOPE for Rational Statin Allocation for Primary Prevention: A Coronary Artery Calcium Picture Is Worth 1000 Words Allocation of statin therapy for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in borderline- and intermediate-risk patients has traditionally been based on population-based global risk assessment and other clinical and laboratory characteristics. Patient-specific treatment decisions are needed to provide maximal benefit and avoid unnecessary treatment. Guideline-based lipid management proposes that coronary artery calcium scoring is reasonable to implement in patients with a 10-year risk of 5.0% to 19.9% (borderline to intermediate risk) by using the pooled cohort equations when the decision about whether to initiate statin therapy is uncertain. We report data from both observational studies and a large primary prevention randomized controlled trial that support the position that this decision is, in fact, uncertain in about half of such patients because of risk misclassification. Such misclassification can be largely avoided by more widespread implementation of coronary calcium scoring, which helps to identify those with coronary artery calcium scores of 0, a finding associated with a less than 5.0% 10-year probability of an ASCVD event. Deferral of statin therapy in such patients, in the absence of smoking, diabetes, or a family history of premature ASCVD, provides more individualized and appropriate care and avoids the expense and potential adverse effects of statin therapy in those with low potential for absolute risk reduction. A rationale is also provided for the importance of coronary artery calcium scoring in women 50 years and older, possibly in place of 1 screening mammogram in women at least 55 years of age to avoid incremental radiation exposure, on the basis of the substantially higher lifetime risk of morbidity and mortality from ASCVD than from breast cancer. In patients with borderline or intermediate ASCVD risk, coronary artery calcium scoring should be used, whenever possible, as an aid to rational statin allocation for the primary prevention of ASCVD.

668,"Stage I-II non-small-cell lung cancer treated using either stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) or lobectomy by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS): outcomes of a propensity score-matched analysis BACKGROUND: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) are both used for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer. We carried out a propensity score-matched analysis to compare locoregional control (LRC).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: VATS lobectomy data from six hospitals were retrospectively accessed; SABR data were obtained from a single institution database. Patients were matched using propensity scores based on cTNM stage, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity score, lung function and performance score. Eighty-six VATS and 527 SABR patients were matched blinded to outcome (1:1 ratio, caliper distance 0.025). Locoregional failure was defined as recurrence in/adjacent to the planning target volume/surgical margins, ipsilateral hilum or mediastinum. Recurrences were either biopsy-confirmed or had to be PET-positive and reviewed by a tumor board.
RESULTS: The matched cohort consisted of 64 SABR and 64 VATS patients with the median follow-up of 30 and 16 months, respectively. Post-SABR LRC rates were superior at 1 and 3 years (96.8% and 93.3% versus 86.9% and 82.6%, respectively, P = 0.04). Distant recurrences and overall survival (OS) were not significantly different.
CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis found a superior LRC after SABR compared with VATS lobectomy, but OS did not differ. Our findings support the need to compare both treatments in a randomized, controlled trial.",Included
2865,"Evaluation of gait speed after applying kinesio tape on quadriceps femoris muscle in patients with knee osteoarthritis BACKGROUND: Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease, known as the most common cause of difficulty walking in older adults and subsequently is associated with slow walking. Functional decline, increased risk of falls and the presence of pain are, in many studies, related to the muscle weakness caused by osteoarthritis especially weakness of the quadriceps muscles. Many studies have shown that the strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle can affect gait, by improving or weakening it. Kinesio Tape is a physiotherapeutic technique, which reduces pain and increases muscular strength by irritating the skin receptors. AIM: This study aimed to verify if the application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle increases gait speed while decreasing the time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test in patients with knee osteoarthritis and also in subjects without knee osteoarthritis. METHOD(S): In this study, we observed the change of gait speed with the help of the 10-meter walk test before, one day and three days after the application of Kinesio Tape in quadriceps femoris muscle. We compared the results of the time needed to perform the 10-meter walk in two groups. In the first group, the Patients group, participated 102 out-patients with a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis, while in the second group, the Control group, participated 73 subjects with a main excluding criterion a clinical diagnosis of primary knee osteoarthritis. RESULT(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease of time needed to perform the 10-meter walk test in both groups three days after application of Kinesio Tape on quadriceps femoris muscle. However, there was not a significant change one day after the application of Kinesio Tape compared before its application in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Our results indicated that there was a significant decrease in time needed to accomplish the 10-meter walk test. Kinesio Tape is a technique that can be used especially when changing walking stereotypes is a long-term goal of the treatment.Copyright © 2018 Klejda Tani, Irena Kola, Vjollca Shpata, Fregen Dhamaj.

1206,"Effect of early risedronate treatment on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation: A prospective single-center study The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of risedronate (RIS) on bone loss and bone turnover markers after liver transplantation (LT). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis within the first month after LT were randomized to receive RIS 35 mg/week plus calcium 1000 mg/day and vitamin D3 800 IU/day (n = 45) or calcium and vitamin D3 at same dosages (n = 44). Primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density (BMD) 6 and 12 months after LT. Secondary endpoints included changes in serum beta-CrossLaps (beta-CTX) and procollagen type 1 amino-terminal peptide (P1NP) and fracture rate. Spine X-rays were obtained at baseline and after 12 months. There was no significant difference in BMD changes between both treatment groups at any sites; either at 6 or 12 months. Spine BMD increased in both groups at 12 months vs. baseline (P = 0.001). RIS patients had a significant increase in intertrochanteric BMD at 12 months (P < 0.05 vs. baseline). Serum beta-CTX decreased in both groups (P < 0.01), with significant differences between groups at 3 months. No significant difference in vertebral fracture incidence was found. After 12 months, BMD improved at lumbar spine and did not change at hip in both groups. Significant differences between both groups were not found. Other factors (calcium and vitamin D replacement, early prednisone withdrawal) seem to have also positive effects in BMD. © 2011 The Authors Transplant International © 2011 European Society for Organ Transplantation.",Excluded
2487,"Quantitative impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry using a Beer-Lambert absorbance model It is well known that red blood cell scattering has an impact on whole blood oximetry as well as in vivo retinal oxygen saturation measurements. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry for scattering angles found in retinal oximetry light paths. Transmittance spectra of whole blood were measured in two different experimental setups: one that included small angle scatter in the transmitted signal and one that measured the transmitted signal only, at absorbance path lengths of 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 microm. Oxygen saturation was determined by multiple linear regression in the 520-600 nm wavelength range and compared between path lengths and experimental setups. Mean calculated oxygen saturation differences between setups were greater than 10% at every absorbance path length. The deviations to the Beer-Lambert absorbance model had different spectral dependences between experimental setups, with the highest deviations found in the 520-540 nm range when scatter was added to the transmitted signal. These results are consistent with other models of forward scatter that predict different spectral dependences of the red blood cell scattering cross-section and haemoglobin extinction coefficients in this wavelength range.",Excluded
2742,"MediGuide in supraventricular tachycardia: Initial experience from a multicentre registry AimsCurrently, fluoroscopy-based catheter visualization is the standard modality in invasive electrophysiological procedures. Recently a new technology for non-fluoroscopic visualization of diagnostic (since 2010) and ablation catheters (since May 2012) has been introduced. The MediGuideTM-Technology (MediGuide) projects catheter tips on prerecorded cine loops in a high time resolution.Methods and resultsWe report on MediGuide-based supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) cases [atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT), atrioventricular reentry tachycardia (AVRT), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) and typical atrial flutter) from two European centres. In all patients, diagnostic and/or ablation catheters with a special sensor were used to perform the ablation procedures. All procedural data such as acute success, duration of the procedure, fluoroscopy time, and dose and patients' characteristics were analyzed and compared with conventionally ablated patients (n = 1865). Procedure-related complications during the hospital stay were recorded. A total of 24 consecutive patients were analyzed: no significant difference to the control group was seen in the baseline characteristics. The MediGuide patients were predominantly male (66%), aged 58 +/- 14 years and were ablated for 6 AVNRT (25%), 4 AVRT/WPW (17%), 1 EAT (4%), and 13 typical atrial flutter (54%). The acute success rate was 100% (98% in the control group, n.s.). The median fluoroscopy time was 0.5 +/- 1.4 min (10.2 +/- 9.6 in the control group, P < 0.001), the median fluoroscopy dose was 187 +/- 554 cGy cm2 (996 +/- 2593 cGy cm2, P < 0.05). Mean procedure time was 70 +/- 25 min (60 +/- 36 min, n.s.). No complications during the hospital stay were recorded.ConclusionIn several different forms of supraventricular tachycardias the MediGuide-Technology contributed to a dramatic reduction in irradiation exposure. With a median fluoroscopy time of 30 s all SVT cases were effectively performed with no complications; the fluoroscopy burden can be significantly reduced not only for the patient but also for the nurses and the physicians performing the case. The overall procedure times are not prolonged due to the use of MediGuide Technology compared with a control group of >1800 patients undergoing conventional ablation procedures. © 2013 The Author.",Excluded
1677,"Low-dose multidetector-row CT-angiography of abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular repair PURPOSE: To investigate the possibility of reducing radiation dose exposure while maintaining image quality using multidetector computed tomography angiography (MDCTA) with high-concentration contrast media in patients undergoing follow-up after endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) to treat abdominal aortic aneurysm., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single center, intra-individual study, patients underwent two consecutive MDCTA scans 6 months apart, one with a standard acquisition protocol (130 mAs/120 kV) and 120 mL of iomeprol 300, and one using a low dose protocol (100 mAs/80 kV) and 90 mL of iomeprol 400. Images acquired during the arterial phase of contrast enhancement were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively for image noise and intraluminal contrast enhancement., RESULTS: Thirty adult patients were prospectively enrolled. Statistically significantly higher attenuation values were measured in the low-dose acquisition protocol compared to the standard protocol, from the suprarenal abdominal aorta to the common femoral artery (p<0.0001; all vascular segments). Qualitatively, image quality was judged significantly (p=0.0002) better with the standard protocol than with the low-dose protocol. However, no significant differences were found between the two protocols in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) (13.63+/-6.97 vs. 11.48+/-8.13; p=0.1058). An overall dose reduction of up to 74% was observed for the low-dose protocol compared with the standard protocol., CONCLUSION: In repeat follow-up examinations of patients undergoing EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm, a low-dose radiation exposure acquisition protocol provides substantially reduced radiation exposure while maintaining a constant CNR and good image quality.

3114,"Clinical and Sialographic Imaging Features of 131I Radiation-induced Submandibular Gland Sialadenitis Purpose: 131I radiation-induced sialadenitis is the most frequent complication of 131I treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma, but little is known about 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast the clinical and sialographic imaging features of 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis to 131I radiation-induced parotitis. Patients and Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included patients with 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis. Clinical records and sialographic image features were evaluated. The predictor variables included age at the time of diagnosis, gender, course of the disease, site of symptoms, and sialographic image grades. The outcome variable was the location of sialadenitis. A student t-test was conducted to analyze the associations between predictor variables and the outcome. Result(s): The sample was composed of 4 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis (100% female), 28 with parotitis (85.7% female), and 1 with submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (P <.05). The occurrence of bilateral glands dysfunction was less often in submandibular glands (SMG: 1/4; PG: 19/28). The age and course of disease were not different between submandibular gland sialadenitis and parotitis (Age, SMG: 46.00 +/- 13.59 years; PG: 50.04 +/- 10.71 years, P >.05; Course of the disease, SMG: 11.00 +/- 16.69 months; PG: 6.96 +/- 11.18 months, P >.05). Radiographically, 7 of 16 patients with parotitis were identified as grade 2 and 9 patients as grade 3. In 3 patients with submandibular gland sialadenitis, 1 patient was identified as grade 2 and 2 patients as grade 3. The postoperative pathological results showed that the proliferation of glandular tissue from the hilum of the submandibular gland caused duct stenosis. Conclusion(s): The results suggest 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis has a lower incidence compared with parotitis and 131I radiation-induced submandibular gland sialadenitis might be related to duct stenosis caused by proliferative glandular tissue after 131I radiation treatment.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",Excluded
654,"Is computed tomography cystography indicated in children with pelvic fractures? Purpose: Pelvic fracture evaluation with abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) and formal CT cystography for rule out of urine bladder injury have been commonly employed in pediatric trauma patients. The additional delayed imaging required to obtain optimal CT cystography is, however, associated with increased doses of ionizing radiation to pelvic organs and represent a significant risk in the pediatric population for future carcinogenic risk. We hypothesized that avoidance of routine CT cystography among pediatric pelvic fracture victims would not result in an appreciable rate of missed bladder injuries and would aid in mitigating the radiation exposure risk associated with these additional images. Method(s): A retrospective cohort study involving blunt trauma pelvic fractures among pediatric trauma patients (age<14) between the years 1997 and 2016 was conducted utilizing the Israeli National Trauma Registry. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS statistical software version 9.4 via the tests of Chi-square test and two-sided Fisher's exact test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): A total of 1072 children were identified from the registry for inclusion. Mean age of patients was 7.7 years (range 0-14) and 713 (66.5%) were male. Overall mortality in this population was 4.1% (44/1072). Only 2.1% (23) of pediatric patients with pelvic fractures had bladder injury identified, with just 9 children having intraperitoneal bladder rupture (0.8% of all the patients). Conclusion(s): The vast majority of blunt pediatric trauma victims with pelvic fractures do not have urine bladder injuries. Based on our study results we do not recommend the routine utilization of CT cystography in this unique population. Copyright © 2019 Chinese Medical Association",Excluded
1812,"Impact of treatment interruptions due to toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy alone We investigated the effect of treatment interruptions due to high-grade (> or =3) toxicity on outcome of patients with early stage (I/II) non-small-cell lung cancer treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (Hfx RT). Of 116 patients treated with total tumour doses of 69.6 Gy, 1.2 Gy b.i.d. fractionation, 44 patients refused surgery while 72 patients were medically inoperable due to existing co-morbid states. Patients who were medically inoperable had worse KPS (P=0.0059) and more pronounced weight loss (P=0.0005). Among them, 12 patients experienced high-grade toxicity and 11 of them with either acute (n=6) or ""consequential"" late (n=5) high-grade toxicity requested interruption in the Hfx RT course (range, 12-25 days; median, 17 days). Superior survival (OS) was observed in patients who refused surgery when compared to those who were medically inoperable (P=0.0041), as well as superior local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) (P=0.011), but not different distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.14). Cause-specific survival (CSS) also favoured patients who refused surgery (P=0.004). Multivariate analysis showed independent influence of the reason for not undergoing surgery on OS (P=0.035), but not on LRFS (P=0.084) or CSS (P=0.068). Patients who refused surgery did not experience high-grade toxicity (0/44), whereas 11 of 72 patients with medical inoperability and co-morbid states experienced high-grade toxicity and had treatment interruptions to manage toxicity (P=0.0064). Patients without treatment interruptions had significantly better OS (P=0.00000), LRFS (P=0.00000) and CSS (P=0.00000) than those with treatment interruptions. When corrected for treatment interruptions, the reason for not undergoing surgery independently influenced OS (P=0.040), but not LRFS (P=0.092) or CSS (P=0.068). In contrast to this, treatment interruption was independent prognosticator of all three endpoints used (P=0.00031, P=0.0075 and P=0.00033, respectively). When 11 patients with treatment interruptions were excluded, the reason for not undergoing surgery still affected OS (P=0.037) and CSS (P=0.039) but not LRFS (P=0.11). Multivariate analyses using OS, CSS and LRFS showed that the reason for not undergoing surgery affected OS (P=0.0436), but neither CSS (P=0.083) nor LRFS (P=0.080).",Excluded
2898,"Pembrolizumab with or without radiotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a pooled analysis of two randomised trials Background: Radiotherapy might augment systemic antitumoral responses to immunotherapy. In the PEMBRO-RT (phase 2) and MDACC (phase 1/2) trials, patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly allocated immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) with or without radiotherapy. When the trials were analysed individually, a potential benefit was noted in the combination treatment arm. However, owing to the small sample size of each trial, differences in response rates and outcomes were not statistically significant but remained clinically notable. We therefore did a pooled analysis to infer whether radiotherapy improves responses to immunotherapy in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. Method(s): Inclusion criteria for the PEMBRO-RT and MDACC trials were patients (aged >=18 years) with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and at least one unirradiated lesion to monitor for out-of-field response. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients had previously received chemotherapy, whereas in the MDACC trial, patients could be either previously treated or newly diagnosed. Patients in both trials were immunotherapy-naive. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) and stratified by smoking status (<10 vs >=10 pack-years). In the MDACC trial, patients were entered into one of two cohorts based on radiotherapy schedule feasibility and randomly assigned (1:1). Because of the nature of the intervention in the combination treatment arm, blinding to radiotherapy was not feasible in either trial. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously (200 mg every 3 weeks) with or without radiotherapy in both trials. In the PEMBRO-RT trial, the first dose of pembrolizumab was given sequentially less than 1 week after the last dose of radiotherapy (24 Gy in three fractions), whereas in the MDACC trial, pembrolizumab was given concurrently with the first dose of radiotherapy (50 Gy in four fractions or 45 Gy in 15 fractions). Only unirradiated lesions were measured for response. The endpoints for this pooled analysis were best out-of-field (abscopal) response rate (ARR), best abscopal disease control rate (ACR), ARR at 12 weeks, ACR at 12 weeks, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The intention-to-treat populations from both trials were included in analyses. The PEMBRO-RT trial (NCT02492568) and the MDACC trial (NCT02444741) are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov. Finding(s): Overall, 148 patients were included in the pooled analysis, 76 of whom had been assigned pembrolizumab and 72 who had been assigned pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy. Median follow-up for all patients was 33 months (IQR 32.4-33.6). 124 (84%) of 148 patients had non-squamous histological features and 111 (75%) had previously received chemotherapy. Baseline variables did not differ between treatment groups, including PD-L1 status and metastatic disease volume. The most frequently irradiated sites were lung metastases (28 of 72 [39%]), intrathoracic lymph nodes (15 of 72 [21%]), and lung primary disease (12 of 72 [17%]). Best ARR was 19.7% (15 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 41.7% (30 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR] 2.96, 95% CI 1.42-6.20; p=0.0039), and best ACR was 43.4% (33 of 76) with pembrolizumab versus 65.3% (47 of 72) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (2.51, 1.28-4.91; p=0.0071). Median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (IQR 2.9-5.9) with pembrolizumab alone versus 9.0 months (6.8-11.2) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67, 95% CI 0.45-0.99; p=0.045), and median overall survival was 8.7 months (6.4-11.0) with pembrolizumab versus 19.2 months (14.6-23.8) with pembrolizumab plus radiotherapy (0.67, 0.54-0.84; p=0.0004). No new safety concerns were noted in the pooled analysis. Interpretation(s): Adding radiotherapy to pembrolizumab immunotherapy significantly increased responses and outcomes in patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. These results warrant validation in a randomised phase 3 trial. Funding(s): Merck Sharp & Dohme.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1623,"Low-dose computed tomography versus plain abdominal radiography in the investigation of an acute abdomen Background: To compare low-dose abdominal computed tomography (LDCT) with plain abdominal radiography (AR) in the primary investigation of acute abdominal pain to determine if there is a difference in diagnostic yield, the number of additional investigations required and hospital length of stay (LOS). Method(s): This randomized controlled trial was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained. Patients presenting to the emergency department with an acute abdomen and who would normally be investigated with AR were randomized to either AR or LDCT. The estimated radiation dose of the LDCT protocol was 2-3mSv compared to 1.1mSv for AR. Pearson's chi-square and the independent samples t-test were used for the statistical analysis. Result(s): A total of 142 patients were eligible, and after exclusions and omitting those with incomplete data, 55 patients remained for analysis in the AR arm and 53 in the LDCT arm. A diagnosis could be obtained in 12 (21.8%) patients investigated with AR compared to 34 (64.2%) for LDCT (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight (50.9%) patients in the AR group required further imaging during their admission compared to 14 (26.4%) in the LDCT group (P= 0.009). There was no difference in the median hospital LOS (3.84 days for AR versus 4.24 days for LDCT, P= 0.83). Conclusion(s): LDCT demonstrates a superior diagnostic yield over AR and reduces the number of subsequent imaging tests for a minimal cost in radiation exposure. However, there is no difference in the overall hospital LOS between the two imaging strategies. © 2011 The Authors. ANZ Journal of Surgery © 2011 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Excluded
1407,"Correlation of physical exam findings with fever in patients with skin and soft tissue infections Introduction: The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of fever in adult ED patients with skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) and to determine which, if any, physical exam, radiograph and laboratory test findings were associated with fever. Method(s): We conducted a prospective, observational study at an urban county trauma center of adults who presented to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. ED providers measured area of erythema and induration using a tape measure, and completed data sheets indicating comorbid conditions and the presence or absence of physical exam findings. Fever was defined as any recorded temperature > 38degreeC during the first six hours of ED evaluation. Result(s): Of the 734 patients enrolled, 96 (13.1%) had fever. Physical and laboratory exam findings associated with the presence of a fever in multivariable logistic regression were the area of erythema, particularly the largest quartile of area of erythema, 144-5,000 cm2, (odd ratio [OR] = 2.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.6-5.2]) and leukocytosis (OR = 4.4, 95% CI [2.7-7.0]). Bullae, necrosis, streaks, adenopathy, and bone involvement on imaging were not associated with fever. Conclusion(s): Fever is uncommon in patients presenting to the ED for evaluation of suspected SSTI. Area of erythema and leukocytosis were associated with fever and should be considered in future decision rules for the evaluation and treatment of SSTI.Copyright © 2017 Mongelluzzo et al.",Excluded
36,"CT findings of KUB injury in Hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury patients with microscopic hematuria Background: According to controversial guideline for management in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Most of the patients could be omitted for abdominal computed tomography (CT). Despite high sensitivity and specificity of abdominal CT, in addition to high medical cost, there are risks from radiation exposure and adverse reaction from use of contrast media. Objective(s): To evaluate the prevalence of KUB injury on abdominal CT in case of hemodynamically stable blunt abdominal injury with microscopic hematuria. Material(s) and Method(s): Forty-one studies of abdominal CT performed during 1 January 2010 and 30 June 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for KUB injury (categorized by AAST organ injury scale) by consensus of two experienced radiologists. Result(s): KUB injury was found in 36.6% from all selected CT studies. Almost all cases could be managed conservatively. The cutoff point of microscopic hematuria at 20 cells/hpf has sensitivity 80% and specificity 46.15%. Conclusion(s): One-third of the patients have KUB injury but almost all of them could be conservatively managed. We proposed that the cutoff point of hematuria be equivalent to or greater than 20 cells/hpf to be one of the indicators for predicting KUB injury that needs radiological evaluation; but it should be carefully considered along with clinical information.Copyright © 2015 Medical Association of Thailand.

2118,"Ultrasonographic Features of the Major Salivary Glands after Radioactive Iodine Ablation in Patients with Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma The aim of this study was to evaluate the ultrasonographic features of the major salivary glands (MSGs) after post-operative radioactive iodine ablation (RIA) in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The study population comprised 202 consecutively registered PTC patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy, RIA and follow-up neck ultrasonography. The ultrasonographic features of the MSGs in each patient were retrospectively evaluated by a single radiologist, and the presence of post-RIA changes was determined by direct comparisons of pre- and post-RIA follow-up ultrasonographic scans. Of the 202 patients, 94 (46.5%) had post-RIA changes in the MSGs on follow-up ultrasonography. RIA dose was closely associated with the prevalence of post-RIA changes. Post-RIA changes were more common in the parotid glands (n = 93, 46.0%) than in the submandibular glands (n = 7, 3.5%). Common ultrasonographic findings representing post-RIA changes in MSGs included coarse echotexture, decreased echogenicity, lobulated margin and decreased gland size.

1158,"Long term effects of radiation exposure on telomere lengths of leukocytes and its associated biomarkers among atomic-bomb survivors Ionizing radiation (IR) is a major source of cellular damage and the immediate cellular response to IR has been well characterized. But the long-term impact of IR on cell function and its relationship with aging are not known. Here, we examined the IR effects on telomere length and other biomarkers 50 to 68 years post-exposure (two time points per person) in survivors of the atomic bombing at Hiroshima during WWII. We found that telomere length of leukocytes was inversely correlated with the dose of IR (p=0.008), and this effect was primarily found in survivors who were exposed at younger ages; specifically those <12 years old (p=0.0004). Although a dose-related retardation of telomere shortening with age was observed in the cross-sectional data, longitudinal follow-up after 11 years did not show IR exposure-related alteration of the rate of telomere shortening with age. In addition, IR diminished the associations between telomere length and selected aging biomarkers that were observed in survivors with no dose. These included uric acid metabolism, cytokines, and blood T cell counts. These findings showed long-lasting detrimental effects of IR on telomere length of leukocytes in both dose- and age-at-exposure dependent manner, and on alterations of biomarkers with aging.",Included
1527,"Diagnostic accuracy of 1.5-t unenhanced whole-heart coronary MR Angiography Performed with 32-Channel Cardiac Coils: Initial single-center experience Purpose: To compare the imaging time and image quality obtained with whole-heart coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and determine the accuracy of MR angiography performed with 32-channel coils in the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials andMethods: The institutional review board approved the study protocol, and all participants provided written informed consent. The authors studied 10 healthy subjects and 67 patients suspected of having CAD who were scheduled for coronary angiography. Unenhanced 1.5-T coronary MR angiography was performed with fi ve- and 32-channel coils in healthy subjects and with 32-channel coils in patients. Clinicallysignifi cant CAD was defi ned as a diameter reduction of at least 50% at coronary angiography. The sensitivity and specifi city of coronary MR angiography were calculated. Result(s): The mean imaging time was substantially reduced from 2.3 minutes 6 4.2 (standard deviation) with fi ve-channel coils to 6.3 minutes 6 2.2 with 32-channel coils, with equivalent image quality scores. Acquisition of MR angiograms was completed in all 67 patients, with a mean imaging time of 6.2 minutes 6 2.8. The prevalence of CAD in he study population was 58% (39 of the 67 patients). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves determined at vessel- and patient-based analyses were 0.91 and 0.90, respectively; the sensitivity and specifi city at vessel-based analysis were 86% and 93%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Whole-heart coronary MR angiography performed at 1.5 T with 32-channel coils permits noninvasive detection of CAD with substantially reduced imaging time. This noninvasive approach can be an alternative to multidetector computed tomographic coronary angiography for ruling out obstructive CAD in patients who have a contraindication to contrast material and in young subjects who are at higher risk from ionizing radiation. © RSNA, 2011.",Excluded
2937,"Models to study gravitational biology of Mammalian reproduction Mammalian reproduction evolved within Earth's 1-g gravitational field. As we move closer to the reality of space habitation, there is growing scientific interest in how different gravitational states influence reproduction in mammals. Habitation of space and extended spaceflight missions require prolonged exposure to decreased gravity (hypogravity, i.e., weightlessness). Lift-off and re-entry of the spacecraft are associated with exposure to increased gravity (hypergravity). Existing data suggest that spaceflight is associated with a constellation of changes in reproductive physiology and function. However, limited spaceflight opportunities and confounding effects of various nongravitational factors associated with spaceflight (i.e., radiation, stress) have led to the development of ground-based models for studying the effects of altered gravity on biological systems. Human bed rest and rodent hindlimb unloading paradigms are used to study exposure to hypogravity. Centrifugation is used to study hypergravity. Here, we review the results of spaceflight and ground-based models of altered gravity on reproductive physiology. Studies utilizing ground-based models that simulate hyper- and hypogravity have produced reproductive results similar to those obtained from spaceflight and are contributing new information on biological responses across the gravity continuum, thereby confirming the appropriateness of these models for studying reproductive responses to altered gravity and the underlying mechanisms of these responses. Together, these unique tools are yielding new insights into the gravitational biology of reproduction in mammals.",Excluded
2845,"A review of forty-five years study of Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Thyroid cancer: reports up to date and a review Evidence to date from a number of studies, indicates that there is an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among A-bomb survivors, and that the incidence rises with increase of dose and is especially predominant in females exposed at younger ages. Although 45 years have elapsed since A-bomb exposure, there are still some questions about the development of thyroid cancer: 1) Is the incidence now decreasing? 2) What factors, other than radiation exposure, are involved? 3) What is the incidence of multiple cancer, including thyroid cancer? With these questions in mind, it is apparent that studies in this field must continue for some time to come.",Included
2724,"The Artemis Program: An Overview of NASA's Activities to Return Humans to the Moon NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars. 2020 IEEE.",Excluded
3309,"Damage of nasal mucociliary movement after intensity-modulated radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radiation usually results in paranasal sinusitis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), which influences patients' quality of life. This study aimed to determine the relationships between dose distribution in the nasal cavity and nasal mucous injury in patients with NPC treated by intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and to find the tolerable radiation dose for the nasal mucous., METHODS: Sixty-six patients with NPC treated by IMRT between October 2006 and November 2008 were enrolled. The irradiation dose in the nasal cavity was determined by the computer with the IMRT work platform. Mucociliary transport rate (MTR) was detected by modified saccharine test before IMRT, at the end of IMRT, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after IMRT., RESULTS: The data were available for 129 nasal cavities. The cavities receiving a mean dose below or equal to 37 Gy showed substantial preservation of nasal mucous after IMRT. The MRT decreased to (62.82 +/- 38.59)%, (56.78 +/- 37.79)%, (64.05 +/- 39.37)%, and (71.13 +/- 39.55)% of pre-IMRT value at 4 time points after IMRT, with significant differences among the data (P < 0.05). In contrast, when the cavities received a mean dose higher than 37 Gy, no significant differences in MTR among the time points were observed. At 3 months after IMRT, the MTR was the lowest (38.27% of pre-RT value)., CONCLUSIONS: A mean radiation dose of <= 37 Gy for the nasal cavity is an optimal dose to protect the nasal cavity function.",Excluded
192,"Apparent migration of implantable port devices: normal variations in consideration of BMI PURPOSE: To evaluate the extent of normal variation in implantable port devices between supine fluoroscopy and upright chest x-ray in relation to body mass index (BMI) based on three different measurement methods.
METHODS: Retrospectively, 80 patients with implanted central venous access port systems from 2012-01-01 until 2013-12-31 were analyzed. Three parameters (two quantitative and one semi-quantitative) were determined to assess port positions: projection of port capsule to anterior ribs (PCP) and intercostal spaces, ratio of extra- and intravascular catheter portions (EX/IV), normalized distance of catheter tip to carina (nCTCD). Changes were analyzed for males and females and normal-weight and overweight patients using analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparison.
RESULTS: PCP revealed significantly greater changes in chest x-rays in overweight women than in the other groups (p&lt;0.001, F-test). EX/IV showed a significantly higher increase in overweight women than normal-weight women and men and overweight men (p&lt;0.001). nCTCD showed a significantly greater increase in overweight women than overweight men (p = 0.0130). There were no significant differences between the other groups. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was high (Cronbach alpha of 0.923-1.0) and best for EX/IV.
CONCLUSIONS: Central venous port systems show wide normal variations in the projection of catheter tip and port capsule. In overweight women apparent catheter migration is significantly greater compared with normal-weight women and with men. The measurement of EX/IV and PCP are straightforward methods, quick to perform, and show higher reproducibility than measurement of catheter tip-to-carina distance.",Excluded
1155,"Segmental Differences in Radiation-Induced Alterations of Tight Junction-Related Proteins in Non-Human Primate Jejunum, Ileum and Colon Dysfunction of the intestinal epithelial barrier and leakage of luminal antigens and bacteria across the barrier have been linked to various human diseases. Intestinal permeability is regulated by intercellular structures, termed ""tight junction"" (Tj), which are disrupted after total-body irradiation (TBI). In this study, we investigated radiation-induced alterations in Tj-related proteins in the jejunum, ileum and colon of a non-human primate (NHP) model. NHPs were total-body irradiated with 6.7 and 7.4 Gy and intestines were procured at day 4, 7 and 12. Radiation exposure was found to induce significant increases in claudin-10 mRNA early (day 4) in all three gut segments and claudin-4 mRNA levels were repressed through day 12. TNF-alpha was highly induced in the jejunum and colon at early time points, but little induction was found in the ileum. Claudin-1 was induced only in the colon on day 4 postirradiation. Unlike the colon and jejunum, the ileum levels of claudin-7 were significantly downregulated through day 12 postirradiation. Western blot analysis revealed increased levels of claudin-2 on day 4 and of JAM-1 on day 7 postirradiation in all three gut segments. E-cadherin was downregulated on day 4 postirradiation in all segments, but remained reduced in the jejunum only until day 12. Taken together, these data suggest that exposure to radiation causes segment-specific alterations in the expression of Tj-related proteins. Interruption of Tjs may be a key factor contributing to injury to the intestinal mucosal barrier and increased intestinal permeability.",Included
2483,"Biological effects of low-dose chest CT on chromosomal DNA Background: Although the National Lung Screening Trial reported a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality when low-dose (LD) CT chest examinations are used for a diagnosis, their biologic effects from radiation exposure remain unclear. Purpose(s): To compare LD CT and standard-dose (SD) CT for DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations (CAs) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Material(s) and Method(s): Between March 2016 and June 2018, 209 participants who were referred to a respiratory surgery department for chest CT studies were prospectively enrolled in this study. Individuals were excluded if they had undergone radiography examinations within the last 3 days or had undergone chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Peripheral blood samples were obtained before and 15 minutes after CT. The number of g-H2AX foci and unstable CAs in lymphocytes was quantified by immunofluorescent staining of g-H2AX and by fluorescence in situ hybridization by using peptide nucleic acid probes for centromeres and telomeres, respectively. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for statistical analysis. Bonferroni correction was applied for multiple comparisons. Result(s): Of the 209 participants (105 women, 104 men; mean age, 67.0 years 6 11.3 [standard deviation]), 107 underwent chest LD CT and 102 underwent chest SD CT. Sex distribution, age, and body size metrics were similar between the two groups. The median effective dose of LD CT and SD CT was 1.5 and 5.0 mSv, respectively. The number of double-strand breaks and CAs increased after a SD CT examination (g-H2AX, P , .001; CAs, P = .003); the number of double-strand breaks and CAs before and after LD CT was not different (g-H2AX, P = .45; CAs, P = .69). Conclusion(s): No effect of low-dose CT on human DNA was detected. In the same setting, DNA double-strand breaks and chromosome aberrations increased after standard-dose CT.Copyright © RSNA, 2020.",Included
1973,"Irradiation-resistance conferred by superoxide dismutase: possible adaptive role of a natural polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster The toxic effects of ionizing radiation to DNA are thought to be due to the generation of the superoxide radical, 02-. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), which scavenges 02-., has been invoked as a protecting enzyme against ionizing radiation in viruses, bacteria, mammalian cells in culture, and live mice. We now demonstrate that SOD is involved in the resistance of Drosophila melanogaster against irradiation. The protection is greatest when flies carry the S form of the enzyme (which exhibits highest in vitro specific activity), intermediate when they carry the F form of the enzyme, and lowest when they are homozygous for N, an allele that reduces the amount of the enzyme to 3.5% of the normal level. Natural selection experiments show that the fitness of the high-activity S allele is increased in an irradiated population relative to the nonirradiated control. These results point towards a possible adaptive function of the S/F polymorphism found in natural populations of D. melanogaster.",Included
1389,"Treatment of recurrent bronchial carcinoma: the role of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy PURPOSE: This study's aim was to assess outcome and toxicity of high-dose-rate endoluminal brachytherapy (HDREB) for recurrent bronchial carcinoma., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1987 to 2005, 41 patients were treated with HDREB for symptomatic recurrent bronchial carcinoma. All patients had previously undergone external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with a median dose of 56 Gy (range, 30-70 Gy). The median HDREB dose applied was 15 Gy (range, 5-29 Gy). The median time interval between primary EBRT and reirradiation was 9 months (range, 2-54 months)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 6.7 months, the 6-, 12-, and 24-month overall survival rates were 58%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The median overall survival time was 6.7 months. Local remission was achieved in 73% of patients (n = 30). A total of 24% of patients (n = 10) showed no response or progressive disease within 8 weeks after treatment. In 1 patient, treatment response was not documented. The 6-, 12-, and 24-month local control rates were 38%, 17%, and 3%, respectively. The median local progression-free survival time was 4 months (range, 1-23 months). Prognostic factors were a total dose of >or=15 Gy of HDREB (p = 0.029) and a Karnofsky performance score of >or=80% (p = 0.0012). The cause of death was locoregional progression in 27% of patients (n = 11), distant metastases in 24% of patients (n = 10), fatal hemorrhage in 15% of patients (n = 6), and other causes in 29% of patients (n = 12). None of the patients with locally controlled disease showed grade 3 or 4 late effects., CONCLUSIONS: Palliative treatment of symptomatic, locally recurrent bronchial carcinoma with HDREB can effectively relieve symptoms in the majority of patients while causing only few complications. Still, time to progression is short. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
969,"Tryptophan metabolism in the non-tumoral hemisphere: A pet study of 99 glioma patients BACKGROUND: Positron emission tomography (PET) with alpha[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan (AMT) can track serotonin synthesis (in brain) and also the immunosuppressive kynurenine pathway (often activated in gliomas). Tumoral AMT uptake can predict tumor type and distinguish radiation injury from glioma recurrence.Now we analyzed clinical correlates of decreased AMT uptake in the contralateral hemisphere of glioma patients (reported recently: Juhasz et al. Clin Nucl Med, 2012;37:838-42). METHOD(S): We analyzed 99 (46/53 pre-/post-treatment) AMT-PET scans of patients (mean age: 52 years) with WHO grade II-IV glioma. Standardized uptake values (SUV) and unidirectional AMT uptake (K-complex, a measure of brain serotonin synthesis; available in 93 cases) were quantified in cortical and subcortical regions of the non-tumoral hemisphere. The effect of gender, age, tumor grade, and treatment on cortical/subcortical AMT uptake, and associations with survival (in the post-treatment group), were analyzed. RESULT(S): AMT K-complex was higher in females than males in the thalamus (p = .012, t-test) and frontal cortex (p = .047) in the whole group and in post-treatment patients (p = .017 and p = .009, respectively). Females also had higher thalamic SUV than males in the whole group (p = .029). AMT K-complex in the thalamus showed a moderate decline with age in the whole group (Pearson's r = -0.24; p = .009) and in the post-treatment subgroup (r = -0.34; p = .023). There was no difference in AMT-PET parameters between the pre- and post-treatment subgroups, and no correlation was found between cortical/subcorticalAMT-PET parameters and tumor grade. Higher thalamic and putaminal SUV predicted shorter survival (log-rank: p = 0.003, p = 0.013, respectively), but not independently from tumoral SUV. CONCLUSION(S): While glioma grade and treatment do not appear to directly affect tryptophan metabolism in the non-tumoral hemisphere, an age-related decline and gender differences, in subcortical structures and/or frontal cortex, may occur, particularly post-treatment. This could indicate remote serotonergic abnormalities whose relation to clinical symptoms (e.g., glioma-associated depression) and clinical outcome warrants further studies.",Excluded

2862,"Acute phase response before treatment predicts radiation esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation esophagitis (RE) represents an inflammatory reaction to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that aspects of the physiologic acute phase response (APR) predicts RE., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 285 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation. The primary analysis was the association of pretreatment lab values reflective of the APR with symptomatic (grade 2) RE. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to test associations of clinical and pretreatment lab values with RE. Optimal cutpoints and multivariable risk stratification groupings were determined via recursive partitioning analysis., RESULTS: Pretreatment platelet counts were higher and hemoglobin levels lower in patients who developed RE (P<0.05). Based on these two pre-treatment risk factors, an APR score was defined as 0 (no risk factors), 1 (either risk factor), or 2 (both risk factors). APR score was significantly associated with RE in both univariate (OR = 2.3 for each point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.4, P = 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4, P = 0.002) analyses., CONCLUSIONS: The APR score may represent a novel metric to predict RE. However, pending validation in an independent dataset, caution is advised when interpreting these results given their retrospective and thus exploratory nature. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3201,"Intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a rhenium-188 filled balloon catheter in restenotic lesions of native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts Purpose: We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in a randomised trial including de novo lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventions in restenotic lesions and in stenoses of venous bypass grafts are characterised by a high recurrence rate for restenosis and re-interventions. Against this background, we wanted to assess the impact of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Method(s): In 243 patients, beta-brachytherapy with 22.5 Gy was applied at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm. Patients were followed up angiographically after 6 months and clinically for 12 months. The primary clinical endpoint was the incidence of MACE (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Secondary angiographic endpoints were late loss and binary restenosis rate in the total segment. Result(s): All irradiation procedures were successfully performed. A total of 222 lesions were in native coronary arteries; 21 were bypass lesions. Mean irradiation length was 41.6+/-17.3 mm (range 20-150 mm) in native coronary arteries and 48.1+/-33.9 mm (range 30-180 mm) in bypass lesions; the reference diameter was 2.57+/-0.52 mm and 2.83+/-0.76 mm, respectively. There was no vessel thrombosis during antiplatelet therapy. Angiographic/clinical follow-up rate was 84%/100%. MACE rate was 17.6% in the native coronary artery group and 38.1% in the CABG group (p<0.03). Binary restenosis rate was 22.5% and 55.6% (p<0.01), and late loss was 0.38+/-0.72 mm and 1.33+/-1.11 mm (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that intracoronary beta-brachytherapy with a liquid 188Re-filled balloon using 22.5 Gy at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm in restenotic lesions is safe. It is associated with a low binary restenosis rate, resulting in a low occurrence rate of MACE within 12 months in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries but not in vein grafts. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
2244,"Definitive chemoradiotherapy of limited-disease small cell lung cancer: Retrospective analysis of new predictive factors affecting treatment results The aim of this study was to evaluate potential predictive factors in the treatment of limited-disease small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). A total of 33 patients with LD-SCLC who underwent definitive chemoradiotherapy at our institute between April 1996 and May 2007 were enrolled in our retrospective study. The relationship between a range of potential predictive factors and the initial response, time to progression and pattern of failure was analyzed. The factors evaluated included the tumor markers Pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (Pro-GRP) and neuron-specific enolase; net tumor size (sum of each lesion mass on computed tomography at 1-cm intervals); total radiation dose; biological effective dose (BED); overall treatment time (OTT); time between the start of any type of treatment and the end of radiation therapy (SER). In addition, the novel factors of radiation dose-intensity (RDI = BED/OTT) and RDI/NTS (= RDI/net tumor size) were defined. Of the 33 patients evaluated in our study, 22 (67%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 27 (82%) experienced treatment failure or recurrence. High RDI/NTS values showed a significant correlation with CR (P=0.043). Prolonged OTT and lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with recurrence within 12 months (P=0.022, 0.033 and 0.015, respectively). The lower values of RDI and RDI/NTS showed a significant correlation with distant metastasis as a first failure site (P=0.038 and 0.044, respectively). Patients with RDI/NTS =0.08 had a more favorable prognosis (P=0.045). Thus, RDI and RDI/NTS may become beneficial predictive factors in the treatment of LD-SCLC. However, further studies are required to confirm our preliminary results.",Excluded
2826,"Cerebral metastases pathology after radiosurgery: a multicenter study BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, comprehensive human pathologic investigations that explore fundamental radiosurgical effects on metastatic brain tumors are sparse in the literature. The objective of this study was to analyze histopathologic findings in a set of clinically recurrent cerebral metastases after patients underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)., METHODS: In a series of 7500 patients who underwent radiosurgery, 2020 patients (27%) harbored cerebral metastases. Eighteen of 2020 patients (0.9%) underwent subsequent craniotomy for tumor removal anywhere from 1 month to 59 months after they received high-dose irradiation. Histologic and immunohistochemical investigations were performed on the surgically resected tissue specimens. These specimens were within the radiosurgical treatment volume of the metastatic tumor., RESULTS: Light microscopy revealed 3 basic categories of histologic responses: acute-type, subacute-type, and chronic-type tissue reactions. A moderate-to-intense inflammatory cell reaction was seen in the tissue responses of well controlled neoplasms (i.e., in patients who had neoplasms that required craniotomy for recurrent disease > 5 months after SRS), whereas the inflammatory reaction was missing or sparse in poorly controlled neoplasms (patients who required craniotomy for recurrent disease < 5 months after SRS). This reaction was seen within the irradiated tumor volume and not in the peritumoral area nor in areas remote from the radiosurgical treatment volume. Immunohistochemical characterization demonstrated the presence of prominent CD68-positive macrophage and CD3-positive T-lymphocyte populations. A progressively severe vasculopathy also was observed with increasing time after radiosurgery., CONCLUSIONS: Although causality has not been established, a brisk inflammatory response and more severe vasculopathy were observed in lesions in which recurrences were more delayed.

3351,"Surgeon-performed Ultrasound for the Staging of Acute Diverticulitis: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study INTRODUCTION: Although contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CEACT) is still considered the gold standard for the assessment of suspected acute diverticulitis, in recent years the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been spreading more and more in this setting. The aim of this study is to compare CEACT to POCUS for the diagnosis and staging of suspected acute diverticulitis. METHOD(S): This is a prospective study conducted on 55 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of two Italian Hospitals with a clinical suspicion of acute diverticulitis between January 2014 and December 2017. All the patients included underwent POCUS first and CEACT immediately afterwards, with the diagnosis and the staging reported according to the Hinchey (H) classification modified by Wasvary et al. Three surgeons performed all the POCUS and the same two radiologists retrospectively analyzed all the CEACT images. The radiologists were informed of the clinical suspicion but unaware of the POCUS findings. The CEACT was used as the gold standard for the comparison. RESULT(S): The final cohort included 30 (55%) females and 25 (45%) males. The median age was 62 (24-88) and the median body mass index was 26 (19-42).Forty-six out of 55 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis on both POCUS and CEACT, whereas in seven patients the diagnosis was not confirmed by both methods. POCUS sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS accuracy was 96%.POCUS classified 33 H1a, 11 H1b, 1 H2 and 1 H3 acute diverticulitis. This staging was confirmed in all patients but three (93%) by CEACT. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care ultrasound appeared a reliable technique for the diagnosis and the staging of clinically suspected H1 and H2 acute diverticulitis. It could contribute in saving time and resources and in avoiding unnecessary radiation exposure to most patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.

At presentation, males reported severe erectile dysfunction that was significantly associated with age. However, only in sexual desire was the difference between baseline and phase 3 significant. In females, an improvement was observed in all parameters of FSFI between phase 1 and 3. Females with stage III disease achieved lower scores in almost all parameters of FSFI than those with stage II. Finally, although a quarter of patients reported elevated depression scores, depression was not related to sexual function., CONCLUSION: A significant proportion of cancer patients experience intense levels of sexual dysfunction and depression throughout radiotherapy and the subsequent year.

1410,"Overexpression of AIB1 predicts resistance to chemoradiotherapy and poor prognosis in patients with primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is frequently overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the significance of AIB1 expression in chemoradiotherapy (CRT) sensitivity and its effect on prognosis are still unclear. In this study, the expression of AIB1 was examined by immunohistochemistry in 98 biopsy specimens of primary ESCC patients treated with definitive CRT. AIB1 overexpression was found in 63/98 (64.3%) of the ESCCs. There was a significant association between AIB1 overexpression and distant lymph node metastases (P = 0.011), but not regional lymph node metastases. In the M0 subgroup, overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in stage T4 than in stage T2-3 (66.7%vs 38.5%, P = 0.031). In addition, AIB1 expression was the only factor that showed a significant correlation with CRT response, in which overexpression of AIB1 was observed more frequently in the CRT resistant group than in the CRT effective group (86.5%vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). Univariate analysis revealed that AIB1 overexpression was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (P < 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (P <0.001). Furthermore, AIB1 expression could stratify patient survival in stages T2-3, T4, N1, and M0 (P < 0.05), as well as in the CRT effective group (P < 0.05), and AIB1 overexpression and CRT resistance were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors for both PFS and DSS in multivariate analysis. These findings suggest that overexpression of AIB1 is a useful predictor of CRT resistance and an independent molecular marker of poor prognosis for ESCC patients.",Excluded
3422,"Low dose ionizing radiation exposure and cardiovascular disease mortality: cohort study based on Canadian national dose registry of radiation workers OBJECTIVES: The purpose of our study was to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a Canadian cohort of 337 397 individuals (169 256 men and 168 141 women) occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation and included in the National Dose Registry (NDR) of Canada. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, such as those received during radiotherapy, leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. The emerging evidence of excess risk of CVDs after exposure to doses well below those previously considered as safe warrants epidemiological studies of populations exposed to low levels of ionizing radiation. In the present study, the cohort consisted of employees at nuclear power stations (nuclear workers) as well as medical, dental and industrial workers. The mean whole body radiation dose was 8.6 mSv for men and 1.2 mSv for women. RESULT(S): During the study period (1951-1995), as many as 3 533 deaths from cardiovascular diseases have been identified (3 018 among men and 515 among women). In the cohort, CVD mortality was significantly lower than in the general population of Canada. The cohort showed a significant dose response both among men and women. Risk estimates of CVD mortality in the NDR cohort, when expressed as excess relative risk per unit dose, were higher than those in most other occupational cohorts and higher than in the studies of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. CONCLUSION(S): The study has demonstrated a strong positive association between radiation dose and the risk of CVD mortality. Caution needs to be exercised when interpreting these results, due to the potential bias introduced by dosimetry uncertainties, the possible record linkage errors, and especially by the lack of adjustment for non-radiation risk factors.",Included
3144,"Predicting late effects of pelvic radiotherapy: is there a better approach? PURPOSE: Significant chronic symptoms following pelvic radiotherapy occur more frequently than commonly realized. Predictive factors for the development of late symptoms are poorly defined. Moderate sustained acute (cumulative) toxicity might predict severe late effects better than peak reaction., METHODS AND MATERIALS: To determine prospectively whether peak or cumulative gastrointestinal (GI) acute symptoms better predict late symptoms in patients receiving pelvic radiotherapy. Symptom scores were measured weekly from the start of radiotherapy, and at 1 year using the Modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire-Bowel subset. The possible prognostic impact of patient-related factors was explored., RESULTS: Three hundred and eight patients were recruited. 100 were excluded due to lack of follow-up data at one year resulting from death, too ill, stoma, relapsed, non-response or withdrawal. A further 15 were excluded for incomplete data, leaving 193 patients with evaluable data. Of these, 28 had GI, 101 urological, and 64 gynecological cancers. Patients' median age was 65 years (range, 23-82), and they were treated with median 60 Gy dose for a median of 6 weeks. Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between cumulative acute symptom scores and scores at 1 year (p < 0.001), which was dose-independent (p < 0.001). Acute peak and 1-year scores were not associated (p = 0.431). The correlation coefficient between cumulative acute symptoms and symptoms at 1 year was 0.367 and for peak acute symptoms was weaker at 0.057. Patients with an abnormal body mass index and current smokers were more likely to experience worse symptoms at 1 year., CONCLUSION: Cumulative acute symptoms are more predictive of late symptoms than peak acute changes in score. This association is independent of the radiotherapy dose delivered and is suggestive of a consequential late effect. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1449,"Narrow band ultraviolet B 311 nm in the treatment of vitiligo: Two right-left comparison studies Aim: Evaluation of narrow band ultraviolet B (NB UVB 311 nm) in the treatment of vitiligo by two independent studies. The first study compared NB UVB with a well-established therapeutic modality, psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA), and the second study was conducted to find out whether psoralen might add to its efficacy. Method(s): In the first study, 15 patients were exposed on the left half of their body to UVB 311 nm and then exposed on their right half to UVA after ingestion of psoralen. In the second study, 20 patients were exposed to UVB 311 nm on the left side of the body, followed by ingestion of psoralen and exposure to NB UVB 311 nm 90 min later to the right side of the body. In both studies, while exposing one side, the other was protected by an UV-proof gown. Thus two right-left comparative studies were carried out simultaneously, namely: UVB 311 nm vs. PUVA and UVB 311 nm vs. PUVB 311 nm. Result(s): In the first study, comparison of PUVA and NB UVB 311 nm showed no difference either in the degree of response or in the incidence of complications. In the second study, comparison of PUVB and UVB showed equal clinical improvement on both sides. The cumulative dose needed to achieve the same response on the PUVB side was lower than that on the UVB side, but the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of phototoxic reactions was significantly higher on the PUVB treated body half. Conclusion(s): NB UVB 311 nm has similar repigmentary effects as PUVA. The addition of psoralen does not increase its efficacy. Copyright © Blackwell Munksgaard 2006.",Excluded
1740,"Graft versus host disease-related secretory immunoglobulin A deficiency in bone marrow transplant recipients. Findings in labial saliva Graft versus host disease-dependent decreases in salivary IgA levels were sought in labial gland saliva samples from bone marrow transplant recipients. Transplantation-associated, irradiation-related effects were also present, but these could be avoided if analyses were performed at 1 year or later after transplantation. Sampling of minor gland saliva eliminated the possibility of contamination with IgA-rich serum transudates arising from gingival or mucosal pathways which obscured results from previous studies using whole saliva samples. Patients with active extensive clinical disease had significantly depressed levels of salivary IgA. Since labial saliva is a principal source of total salivary IgA, the present findings may explain why patients with graft versus host disease are susceptible to infection via the sinobronchial portal.",Excluded

2718,"Phosphorylation of Ser312 contributes to tumor suppression by p53 in vivo The tumor suppressor p53 is a master sensor of stress, and posttranslational modifications are key in controlling its stability and transcriptional activities. p53 can be phosphorylated on at least 23 Ser/Thr residues, the majority of which are phosphorylated by stress-related kinases. An exception is Ser315 in human p53 (Ser312 in mouse), which is predominantly phosphorylated by cell cyclerelated kinases. To understand the biological importance of Ser312 phosphorylation in vivo, wegenerated p53Ser312Ala knock-in mice. We show here that, although Ser312 is not essential for mouse life span under normal physiological conditions, Ser312Ala mutation dampens p53's activity during embryonic development. This is evident from its partial rescue of embryonic lethality caused by Mdm4 deletion. In agreement with the notion that Ser312 mutation weakens p53 function, Ser312Ala mice are alsomore susceptible to tumorigenesis following a sublethal ionizing radiation dose. Importantly, in the cohort studied, Ser312 mutation predisposes mice to develop thymic lymphomas and liver tumors, partly due to p53Ser312Ala's inability to fully induce a set of p53 target genes including p21 and cyclin G1. Thus, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser312 is required for p53 to function fully as a tumor suppressor in vivo.",Excluded
639,"Is treatment of hemorrhagic radiation cystitis with hyperbaric oxygen effective? Objective: We report our own experience with the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) for the management of postradiation hemorrhagic cystitis. Method(s): We reviewed retrospectively 14 patients from 2001 to 2007 with different pelvic organ malignancies who developed radiation cystitis after irradiation. Patients received 100% oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber at a pressure of 2.5 atmospheres absolute, 60 min bottom time, once a day, 7 days a week for at least 1 month. In principle, 30 HBO treatments per course were performed. After every course of HBO treatments, therapeutic effect was evaluated. The mean duration of follow-up of all patients was 18 months (range: 1-6 years). Result(s): Patients were divided into 2 groups, group 1 (treatment group, n = 10) and group 2 (without treatment, n = 4). The mean duration between the onset of hematuria and the beginning of HBO therapy was 8.9 months (range: 3-34). Group 2 did not receive HBO because they were not healthy enough. Only 2 patients (20%) of group 1 recovered from their hemorrhagic cystitis. Group 1 had a significantly lower cure rate of postirradiation hemorrhagic cystitis in comparison to group 2. Conclusion(s): Our experience with the use of HBO did not yield favorable results. Randomized well-controlled studies are needed. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
3291,"Survival outcomes and patterns of failure after D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer: A retrospective study objective: The goal of the study was to analyze the incidence and patterns of failure in patients with gastric cancer who received D2 dissection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Method(s): From January 2004 to October 2015, 324 patients with gastric cancer who underwent radical D2 resection followed by postoperative CRT were enrolled. Clinicopathological characteristics and patterns of failure were retrospectively reviewed to identify factors associated with survival and recurrence. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survival rates of these patients were 60.3 and 51.1%, respectively. 117 patients had recurrence or metastasis, with peritoneal recurrence as the most frequent (20.7%), followed by distant metastasis (14.2%). The most commonly involved distant organs were the liver (5.9%) and bone (4.9%). Locoregional failure occurred in 39 patients (12.0%), with isolated regional failure occurring in only 23 (7.1%). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed N stage to be an independent risk factor for distant failure-free survival (p = 0.012). Independent risk factors for peritoneal metastasis were tumor differentiation (p = 0.022), T stage (p =0.035) and vascular invasion (p = 0.016). conclusion: Postoperative CRT has a potential effect on optimizing locoregional control, resulting in only 12.0% of locoregional failure. In patients after D2 resection and adjuvant CRT, peritoneal metastasis was the leading pattern of failure, followed by distant metastasis.Copyright © 2018 British Institute of Radiology.

3408,"Predictors of the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on radiation-induced optic neuropathy following nasopharyngeal carcinoma Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RION) is a severe visual complication resulting from radiotherapy of the head and neck, which mostly occurs in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the southern part of China. The mechanism of RION is unclear. Therefore, identifying risk factors for RION is an important step towards enhancing our understanding. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed patients with NPC who were admitted to Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital for visual loss between 2006 and 2017. The study included 38 participants (68 eyes) in the corticosteroid-effective group and 35 participants (64 eyes) in the corticosteroids-ineffective group. We analyzed potential risk factors for RION and developed a prediction model for the therapeutic effect of corticosteroid effect based on a random forests method. The prediction model showed a high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.932 (95% confidence interval = 0.889-0.975). Our results revealed that blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly associated with RION and that RION patients with higher BUN levels responded better to corticosteroid treatment. Altogether, these results suggest that a prediction model, based on clinical factors, could be applied to estimate the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids on RION. Further investigation, however, is needed to confirm the study conclusion.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
360,"Factors associated with presence and extent of coronary calcium in those predicted to be at low risk according to Framingham risk score (from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) Even among asymptomatic persons at low risk (<10%) according to the Framingham risk score, high coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores signify a greater predicted risk of coronary heart disease events. We sought to determine the noninvasive factors (without radiation exposure) significantly associated with CAC in low-risk, asymptomatic persons. In a cross-sectional analysis, we studied 3,046 participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis at a low 10-year predicted risk (Framingham risk score <10%) of coronary heart disease events. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association of novel markers with the presence of any CAC (CAC >0) and advanced CAC (CAC >= 300). A CAC level of >0 and of >= 300 was present in 30% and 3.5% of participants, respectively. Factor VIIIc, fibrinogen, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were each associated with the presence of CAC (p <= 0.02), and C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and the carotid intima-media thickness with advanced CAC (p <= 0.03). The base model combining the traditional risk factors had excellent discrimination for advanced CAC (C-statistic 0.808). The addition of the 2 best-fit models combining the biomarkers with or without carotid intima-media thickness improved the c-statistic to 0.822 and 0.820, respectively. All 3 models calibrated well but were similar in estimating the individual risk probabilities for advanced CAC (prevalence 9.97%, 10.63%, and 10.10% in the greatest quartiles of predicted probabilities vs 0.26%, 0.26%, and 0.26% in the lowest quartiles, respectively). In conclusion, in low-risk persons, the traditional risk factors alone predicted advanced CAC with high discrimination and calibration. The biomarker combinations with and without carotid intima-media thickness were also significantly associated with advanced CAC; however, the improvement in the prediction and estimation of the clinical risk were modest compared to the traditional risk factors alone.

2841,"Proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for locally advanced tongue cancer Background: The standard treatment for locally advanced tongue cancer is surgery. However, the patient's quality of life is lost. As a newly non-operative treatment, we report the efficacy and toxicity of proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) for locally advanced tongue cancer. Method(s): Between February 2009 and August 2012, 45 cases of stage III-IV(M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (28 men and 17 women) were treated by PBT-IACT at Southern TOHOKU Proton Therapy Center. Median age was 58 years (range:24-83 years), and clinical stage III/IVA/IVB were 11/32/2 respectively. In case of surgery, the patients required subtotal or total resection of the tongue. Initially, 2 courses of systemic chemotherapy and prophyractic whole neck irradiation (36Gy/20fr.) were performed. Subsequently, for gross tumor targets, PBT (33Gy/15fr.) and IACT were administered via the superficial temporal artery by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulphate. For PBT, 1 or 2 portals of 210 MeV proton beam were arranged in optimal angles to avoid overdosing the risk organ. Systemic chemotherapy was performed only for age of 70 years or younger. Result(s): The median follow-up was 27 months (range:8-48 months). Over all survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local control (LC) rates at 2 years were 88%,78%, 80%, respectively. LC of cervical lymph node metastases at 2 years was 86%. As the early toxic event, grade 3 mucositis (32/45) and blood/bone marrow toxicity (22/45) were observed. Within 6 months after this therapy, mandibular osteomyelitis occurred in 1 case. Conclusion(s): PBT-IACT appeared to be safe and has a good LC rate for locally advanced tongue cancer. Furthermore, it is not inferior to surgery and can be one of the new effective treatment options for locally advanced tongue cancer.",Excluded
3270,"Renal atrophy after stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell carcinoma BACKGROUND: Renal atrophy is observed in an irradiated kidney. The aim of this study was to determine dose-volume histogram parameters and other factors that predict renal atrophy after 10-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)., METHODS: A total of 14 patients (11 males, 3 females) who received SBRT for RCC at Tohoku University Hospital between April 2010 and February 2014 were analyzed. The median serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dl and two patients had a single kidney. Nine patients were implanted with fiducial markers. The median tumor diameter was 30 mm. SBRT was delivered at 70 Gy in 10 fractions for 7 tumors, at 60 Gy in 10 fractions for 2 tumors, and at 50 Gy in 10 fractions for 5 tumors with 6 and/or 15 MV X-ray using 5 to 8 multi-static beams. Renal atrophy was assessed using post-SBRT CT images after 12-24 months intervals. Correlations were examined by Spearman rank correlation analysis. Differences between two groups were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test, and pairwise comparisons were made by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test., RESULTS: The median tumor volume shrunk from 14.8 cc to 10.6 cc (p = 0.12), and the median irradiated kidney volume changed from 160.4 cc to 137.1 cc (p < .01). The median peak creatinine level was 1.6 mg/dl after treatment (p < .01). Percentage volumes of the irradiated kidney receiving at least 10 Gy (V10, p = 0.03), V20 (p < .01), V30(p < .01), V40 (p = 0.01), mean irradiated kidney dose (p < .01), and magnitude of overlap between PTV and kidney volume (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with post-treatment irradiated kidney volume in percent, and V20-V30 had strong correlation (r < -0.70, p < .01). Patients with implanted fiducial markers showed a significantly lower ratio of renal atrophy (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant renal atrophic change was observed. Dose distribution of SBRT at 20-30 Gy had a strong correlation with renal atrophy when irradiation was performed in 10 fractions.",Excluded
1147,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1+/-150.5mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2+/-204.6mSv and 150.5+/-211.2mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133, rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) . Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Included
459,"Angiotensin receptor blockade: a novel approach for symptomatic radiation necrosis after stereotactic radiosurgery Preclinical evidence suggests angiotensin blockade therapy (ABT) decreases late radiation toxicities. This study aims to investigate the association between ABT and symptomatic radiation necrosis (SRN) following stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Resected brain metastases (rBM) and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients treated with SRS from 2002 to 2015 were identified. Patients in the ABT cohort were on therapy during SRS and at 1-month follow up. Kaplan Meier method and cumulative incidence model were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and intracranial outcomes. 228 consecutive patients were treated with SRS: 111 with rBM and 117 with AVM. Overall, 51 (22.4%) patients were in the ABT group: 32 (28.8%) in the rBM and 19 (16.2%) in AVM cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher Graded Prognostic Analysis (3-4) in the rBM (ABT: 25.0% vs. non-ABT: 49.0%, p = 0.033) and median age in the AVM (ABT: 51.4 vs. non-ABT: 35.4, p < 0.001) cohorts. In both populations, OS and intracranial efficacy (rBM-local control; AVM-obliteration rates) were statistically similar between the cohorts. ABT was associated with lower 1-year SRN rates in both populations: rBM, 3.1 versus 25.3% (p = 0.003); AVM, 6.7 vs. 14.6% (p = 0.063). On multivariate analysis, ABT was a significant predictive factor for rBM (HR: 0.17; 95% CI 0.03-0.88, p = 0.035), but did not reach statistical significance for AVM (HR: 0.36; 95% CI 0.09-1.52, p = 0.165). ABT use appears to be associated with a reduced risk of SRN following SRS, without detriment to OS or intracranial efficacy. A prospective trial to validate these findings is warranted.",Excluded

Method and materials: In the prospective randomised study, 21 patients with cholangiocarcinoma were treated with implantation of percutaneous stents followed with intraluminal Ir-192 brachytherapy (mean dose 30 Gy) and external radiotherapy (mean dose 50 Gy) and 21 patients were treated only with stents insertion. We did not find any statistically significant differences in age and tumor localization between these two groups of patients. Result(s): All the patients died. In the group of patients treated with brachytherapy and with stent implantation, the mean survival time was 387.9 days. In the group of patients treated only with stent insertion the mean survival was 298 days. In effort to eliminate possible effect of external radiotherapy we treated the control group of eight patients with cholangiocarcinoma by stent insertion and brachyterapy only.

75,"Targeted alpha particle immunotherapy for myeloid leukemia Unlike beta particle-emitting isotopes, a emitters can selectively kill individual cancer cells with a single atomic decay. HuM195, a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody, specifically targets myeloid leukemia cells and has activity against minimal disease. When labeled with the beta-emitters 131I and 90Y, HuM195 can eliminate large leukemic burdens in patients, but it produces prolonged myelosuppression requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at high doses. To enhance the potency of native HuM195 yet avoid the nonspecific cytotoxicity of beta-emitting constructs, the alpha-emitting isotope 213Bi was conjugated to HuM195. Eighteen patients with relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were treated with 10.36 to 37.0 MBq/kg 213Bi-HuM195. No significant extramedullary toxicity was seen. All 17 evaluable patients developed myelosuppression, with a median time to recovery of 22 days. Nearly all the 213Bi-HuM195 rapidly localized to and was retained in areas of leukemic involvement, including the bone marrow, liver, and spleen. Absorbed dose ratios between these sites and the whole body were 1000-fold greater than those seen with beta-emitting constructs in this antigen system and patient population. Fourteen (93%) of 15 evaluable patients had reductions in circulating blasts, and 14 (78%) of 18 patients had reductions in the percentage of bone marrow blasts. This study demonstrates the safety, feasibility, and antileukemic effects of 213Bi-HuM195, and it is the first proof-of-concept for systemic targeted a particle immunotherapy in humans. © 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.",Excluded

Coronary artery segments were assessed for image quality and significant luminal diameter narrowing. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), negative predictive values (NPV), and accuracy of both CTCA groups were determined using conventional catheter angiography (CCA) as reference standard. Radiation dose values were calculated., RESULTS: Both groups were comparable regarding gender, body weight, cardiovascular risk profile, severity of CAD, mean heart rate, heart rate variability, and Agatston score (all p>0.05). There was no significant difference in the rate of non-assessable coronary segments between group 1 (1.6%, 24/1404) and group 2 (1.4%, 19/1385; p=0.77); non-diagnostic image quality was significantly (p<0.001) more often attributed to stair step artifacts in group 1. Segment-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 98%, 98%, 88%, 100%, and 100% among group 1; 96%, 99%, 90%, 100%, and 98% among group 2, respectively. Parameters of diagnostic performance were similar (all p>0.05). Mean effective radiation dose of prospectively ECG-gated CTCA (2.2+/-0.4 mSv) was significantly (p<0.0001) smaller than that of retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA (8.1+/-0.6 mSv)., CONCLUSION: Prospectively ECG-gated CTCA yields similar image quality, performs as accurately as retrospectively ECG-gated CTCA in patients having heart rates <=70 bpm while being associated with a lower mean effective radiation dose.

3360,"Irradiation of male mammary gland for the prevention of hormone induced gynecomastia Treatment of carcinoma of the prostate with female sex hormones causes not only impotence but also swollen, painfully mammary glands. The radiobiological response of the mammary glands renders it possible to prevent hormone induced gynecomastia by means of radiotherapy. On this indication, 121 patients treated with female sex hormones between 1961 and 1972 for carcinoma of the prostate were subjected to irradiation of both mammary glands. On 4 successive days, daily doses of 300 r surface dose were administered to each mammary gland, corresponding to a focal dose of 840 r at 3 cm tissue depth. The parameters were: roentgen radiation, 150 kV, 20 mA, 0.5 mm Cu, focus skin distance 40 cm, field size 6 x 6 m. 84 patients could be followed up more than 6 mth after the treatment. In 67 cases (79.8%), development of gynecomastia was completely suppressed, while in 16 cases, a slight degree of gynecomastia had occurred in spite of the irradiation. In one case, the gynecomastia that had already been completely developed at the time of the radiotherapy, had remained uninfluenced apart from a mitigation of the sensation of tension. In 6 of the patients who were free from gynecomastia (8.9%) the hormone treatment had been started prior to the radiotherapy. This proportion was considerably larger among the patients with mild gynecomastia, viz. 75% (12 cases). The lesser effect of the radiotherapy is considered to be correlated with the duration and dosage of the hormone treatment started prior to the radiotherapy, and may also be correlated with the duration of the interval between the end of the hormone treatment and the start of the irradiation.",Excluded

Patients with NSCLC treated with induction CCRT (chemotherapy: cisplatin and docetaxel; radiotherapy: 2.0 Gy fractions once daily for a total of 46 Gy) before surgery were reviewed. We calculated the percentage of lung volume receiving at least 20 Gy (V20) and the mean lung dose (MLD) for the total lung volume and the lung remaining after resection. Factors affecting the incidence of RP at grade 2 or higher (>= G2 RP) were analyzed. Eighteen of 49 patients (37%) experienced >=G2 RP. The V20 and MLD for the lung remaining after resection (V20r and MLDr) were significant predictors according to the multivariate analysis (p=0.007 and 0.041, respectively). The incidence of >=G2 RP was 8% in patients with V20r<10%, and 13% in patients with MLDr<5.6 Gy, respectively. The optimal approach to reduce the rate of postoperative RP in patients with induction CCRT for NSCLC is to keep the V20r below 10% and/or the MLDr below 5.6 Gy in the radiotherapy planning.",Excluded

This review addresses the factors that contribute to the increasing incidence and considers environmental, and patient-based and clinician-led influences. Articles addressing the causes of the increased incidence were critically reviewed. A complex interplay of environmental, medical, and social pressures has resulted in increased awareness of the thyroid disease risk, increased screening of thyroid cancers, and increased diagnosis of thyroid cancers. Although there is evidence to suggest that the true disease incidence may be changing slightly, most of the increase is related to factors that promote early diagnosis of low-risk lesions, which is resulting in a significant phenomenon of overdiagnosis. An improved understanding of these pressures at a global level will enable healthcare policymakers to react appropriately to this challenge in the future.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
2346,"Ultra-high resolution whole body prototype CT scanner: Influence of image matrix and slice thickness on image quality in the lung Purpose: To evaluate the effect of 0.25mm slice thickness and 1k image matrix on image quality in HR-CT of the lung. Material(s) and Method(s): 59 subsequent patients underwent a CT of the chest on a clinical prototype scanner (TSX-304R, Toshiba) with the following scanning parameters: 0.25mm slice thickness (128 rows), 0.5 seconds rotation time, target SD at 25HU (AEC), 120 kV, AIDR-3D with FC81. Six series of images were reconstructed as follows (slice thickness in mm/image matrix): 0.25/1k, 0.25/512, 0.5/1k, 0.5/512, 2/1k, and 2/512. By using forced ranking, 2 readers (21, 4 y on staff) blinded to the reconstruction method evaluated the series (6 on 1, random order, 4K monitor) in the categories: (1) definition of bronchioli, (2) conspicuity of vasculature, (3) visibility of fissures/septa, (4) blurriness, (5) noise texture, (6) artifacts, and (7) overall preference. The readers also graded their preference on a free scale from 1=excellent quality to 10=low quality. Image noise (SD in ROI) was measured on all reconstructions within the aorta and in air, radiation dose was recorded. All values were statistically analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA for main and interaction effects, and Kendall's W coefficient of concordance for inter-observer agreement on rankings. Result(s): The image matrix size and slice thickness main effects and their interaction were statistically significant at P<0.05 in all cases, with matrix size generally having a stronger effect than slice thickness. In the categories 1-3, the 1k matrix ranked preferably over 512, and 0.25mm was preferred over 0.5 and 2mm for both readers (forced ranking method). 2mm slices at 1k were preferred for noise texture and artifacts, 0.25mm at 512 ranked the lowest in both categories. On free scale ranking in category 7, both readers preferred 0.5mm at 1k (n.s.) and ranked the 2mm 512 matrix the lowest (P<0.001). The inter-observer agreement (Kendall's W) ranged from 0.89 to 0.93 for categories 1-3, and 0.66 to 0.83 for categories 4-7. The mean DLP was 377.9. SD of image noise varied from 58.1HU (0.25/1k) to 25.8HU (2/512) in air. Conclusion(s): For high-resolution CT of the lung, 1k image matrix provides superior image quality compared with 512 matrix, and 0.25mm slices thickness is mostly preferred over 0.5 and 2 mm.",Excluded
786,"Delayed imaging in routine CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis: Is it worth the additional cost of radiation and time? OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the potential benefits of delayed phase imaging series in routine CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Routine contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scans of 1000 consecutively examined patients (912 men, 88 women; average age, 60 years; range, 22-94 years) were retrospectively evaluated, and the added benefits of the delayed phase series through the abdomen were recorded for each examination. Examinations performed for indications requiring multiphasic imaging were excluded. Images were reviewed by two fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists, who were blinded to official CT reports. All examinations were performed between July 2008 and February 2010 at a single institution. Radiation doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure. RESULTS. Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no benefit. In addition, use of the delayed phase resulted in a mean 59.5% increase in effective CONCLUSION. An additional delayed phase through the abdomen in routine contrastenhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis is of low yield, particularly if reliable follow-up imaging to further elucidate uncertain findings is available. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
2532,"Hemostatic radiation therapy for malignant tumorsda retrospective analysis of bleeding resolution rate Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate if hemostatic radiation therapy was effective in resolving the bleeding and to analyze the factors associated with treatment success. Materials/Methods: Records from patients treated with hemostatic radiation therapy between May 2012 and May 2014 in a single institution were reviewed. The endpoints analyzed were: initial bleeding control rate, re-bleeding incidence and final bleeding control (after salvage treatment of initial treatment failures or re-bleeding). Biological equivalent dose (BED) was categorized (<30 Gy10 vs >/Z 30 Gy10). The statistics were done using Kaplan-Meier representation of re-bleeding events in time and Fisher Exact test as hypothesis test for categorical variables using SPSS V2.0 software. The study was previously approved by IRB. Result(s): In total, eighty patients were treated during the period studied. Information concerning symptom response was available for 72 of 80 patients. The overall initial bleeding control rate was 81.9% (59/72). It was 85.7% (12/14), 100% (4/4), 76.5% (13/17), 78.3% (18/23), 77.8% (7/9), and 100% (5/5) in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. Re-bleeding incidence was 25.4% (15/59) of the patients with initial bleeding control, and when it occurred the median time was 8 weeks after the irradiation (range: 1 e 96 weeks). With salvage treatment, the final bleeding control was 64.3%, 100%, 76.5%, 78.3%, 75%, and 100% in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. BED less than 30 Gy10 was not associated with a significant lower control (75.6% vs 92.3%, P = 0.113). Treatment interruptions due to death or worsening of clinical condition (8 cases) were more common in schedules with more than 5 fractions (20% vs 4%, P = 0.047). Conclusion(s): Independently of the fractionation used, radiation therapy was effective in resolving the bleeding from malignant tumors in the urgency scenario, with more than 80% of resolution. However, the probability of treatment discontinuation was greater with the use of more protracted schedules (more than five fractions).",Excluded
2100,"Decreased radiation doses to oral cavity with stick-out tongue position comparing to neutral tongue position in patients treated with intensity modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Case report Purpose/Objective(s): To compare changes in oral cavity (OC) shapes and radiation dose to OC with different tongue positions in intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Materials/Methods: 13 patients with HNSCC underwent CT-simulations with neutral tongue position and stick-out tongue for planning IMRTs (IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively). Planning objectives were to deliver 70 Gy, 63 Gy, and 56 Gy in 35 fractions to 95% of PTVs using simultaneously integrated boost technique, with mean radiation doses (Dmean) of < 26 Gy to the parotid gland, < 30 Gy to the submandibular gland, and < 36 Gy to OC. For other organs at risk (OARs), Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) recommended dose constraints were applied. Planning was optimized to minimize doses to OARs without compromising coverage of PTVs. Radiation doses to OC in IMRT-N and IMRT-S was compared. Data are presented as mean >= standard deviation. Result(s): OC volumes were similar in IMRT-N and IMRT-S (129 >= 34.0 cm3 and 130.8 >= 38.8 cm3, respectively, P = 0.25). Tongue volume in outside of mouth was 7.1 >= 3.8 cm3 (5.4 >= 2.6% of entire OC and 7.8 >= 3.1% of oral tongue) in IMRT-S. Anterior tip of lips to gingiva was 0.9 >= 0.4 cm in IMRT-S and 0.1 >= 0.2 cm in IMRT-N (P<0.001). Distance from base of tongue (BOT) to pharyngeal constrictor (PC) was 1.5 >= 0.5 cm in IMRT-N and 2.0 >= 0.6 cm in IMRT-S (p<0.001). IMRT-N and IMRT-S showed equivalent radiation targets coverages with sparing OARs, except OC. Dmean of OC was 34.9 >= 8.0 Gy and 31.4 >= 8.7 Gy with IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). OC volume receiving >= 36 Gy (V36) was 40.6 >= 16.9% using IMRT-N compared to 33.0 >= 17.0% with IMRT-S (P<0.001). Dmean of oral tongue was 38.1 >= 7.9 Gy and 32.8 >= 8.8 Gy in IMRT-N and IMRT-S, respectively (P<0.001). Dmean of lips was 16.0 >= 3.7 Gy in IMRT-N and 13.5 >= 4.0 Gy in IMRT-S (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): IMRT-S for patients with HNSCC has significant decreased radiation dose to OC and increased distance from BOT to PC and from dorsal surface of tongue to palate than IMRT-N. The use of IMRT-S rather than IMRT-N can significantly decrease radiation dose to OARs in OC or pharynx, which may potentially reduce RT related toxicity in OC or pharynx in patients RT for HNSCC.",Excluded
1746,"Tumorigenicity of human malignant lymphoblasts: comparative study with unmanipulated nude mice, antilymphocyte serum-treated nude mice, and X-irradiated nude mice The ability of unmanipulated, antilymphocyte serum (ALS)-treated, and X-irradiated nude BALB/c female mice (in their 13th backcross generation) to serve as hosts for 10 human lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as for peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy humans was compared. The 10 lymphoma lines included 7 previously characterized and reported in the literature. Significant differences with respect to both latency period for tumor appearance and success rate for tumor transplantation were detected among the 3 experimental groups. The unmanipulated mice were poor recipients for lymphoma heterotranplants, and tumors were produced in only two instances. In contrast, 6 tumor lines were successfully transplanted in mice inoculated with ALS, and all 10 lines were successfully transplanted in X-irradiated recipients. Although tumors were readily produced in ALS-treated and X-irradiated mice, no gross or histologic evidence of focal or distant metastases was apparent. Human lymphoblastoid cells were recultured, essentially unchanged, from the heterotransplants from 6 of 7 tumors tested. Although the tumor line HT 1460, originally from a human lymphoma, was successfully transplanted in all 3 groups, only mouse cells were recultured. The use of X-irradiation, rather than ALS, to immunosuppress nude mice offers a more standardized method for heterotransplanting human tumor cell lines and permits ready comparisons between laboratories. Furthermore X-radiation permits transplantation and subsequent study of lymphoblastoid tumors that are otherwise difficult to successfully transplant in nude mice.",Included
3108,"Tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle OBJECTIVE: To investigate the result of tissue flap transferring for wound repair of the clavicle. METHOD(S): From 1994 to 2000, 3 patients (1 with clavicle osteosynthesis, 1 with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis, and 1 with radioactive ulcer in clavicular region accompanied by chronic osteomyelitis of clavicle) were reconstructed with turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris, and myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal respectively. The outcome was observed. The operation principles of tissue flaps transferring for wound repair of the clavicle were summarized. RESULT(S): Follow-ups were done for 2 months to 7 years. All tissue flaps survived well and the wounds in clavicular region were healed well. There was no recurrence of chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. CONCLUSION(S): Turnover adipofascial flap, myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are often used for wound repair of the clavicle. Most of the wounds of the clavicle can be repaired by turnover adipofascial flap. Myocutaneous flap of pectoris and latissimus dorsal are more suitable for wound repair with chronic clavicle osteomyelitis. In the case of radioactive ulcer of the clavicular region, myocutaneous flap of latissimus dorsal transposition is a better alternative for wound repair.",Excluded
140,"Translocation Frequency in Patients with Repeated CT Exposure: Comparison with CT-Naive Patients Epidemiologic studies using clinical indicators are limited in the assessment of the biological effects of low-dose ionizing radiation for medical purposes. We evaluated the biological effect of low-dose radiation by comparing translocation frequencies in patients with repeated computed tomography (CT) exposure and CT-naive patients. The goal of this prospective case-control study was to determine whether repeated CT exposure is associated with increased frequency in chromosomal translocations. Two cohorts, comprised of case patients with a history of repeated CT exposure and age- and sex-matched CT-naive control patients (n = 48 per cohort), were consecutively enrolled in this single-institution study. CT-radiation exposure was estimated using dose-length products, and translocation frequencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes were assessed using whole chromosome paints by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Comparison of translocation frequencies between cases and controls was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test (paired samples), and the relationship between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency was assessed using a partial correlation analysis. Translocation frequencies were significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.0003). The median translocation frequency was 7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6, 8] for cases and 4 (95% CI: 3, 6) for controls. By using cumulative radiation exposure as the effect variable and translocation frequency as the response variable, we found a significant correlation between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency (r = 0.6579, P < 0.0001). Chromosomal translocations were more frequent with repeated CT-exposed patients than in CT-naive patients, and a positive dose-response relationship was present between cumulative radiation exposure and translocation frequency.",Included
1428,"Preoperative isolated limb infusion of doxorubicin and external irradiation for limb-threatening soft tissue sarcomas Background: At present, limb-sparing surgery is the most appropriate and acceptable treatment option for soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. To increase the number of limb-sparing resections in the treatment of locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities, preoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy are often used. Isolated limb perfusion of cytostatic agents is an effective alternative option but technically complex. Isolated limb infusion, essentially a low-flow isolated limb perfusion without oxygenation via a percutaneous catheter, had been developed as a simple alternative. Objective(s): The objective of this study was to achieve limb-sparing surgery in patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities that would otherwise have required an amputation or a functionally mutilating surgery by performing preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin and external beam irradiation to obtain local control and make limb-sparing surgery feasible. Method(s): A total of 40 patients with locally advanced soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities were evaluated between 2002 and 2005. Tumors were located in the lower limb in 28 patients (70%) and in the upper limb in 12 patients (30%). All of these patients were felt to be unresectable and were referred because amputation was considered the only available treatment option. They underwent preoperative isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg for the upper and lower limbs, respectively). Preoperative external beam radiotherapy started within 3-7 days after isolated limb infusion was administered. The total dose was 35 Gy in ten fractions. After 3-7 weeks, surgery was performed aiming at limb preservation. Result(s): Tumor response was seen in 85% of patients, rendering these large sarcomas resectable in most cases. The mean values of pretreatment tumor volume and post-treatment volume were 2797 cm3 and 1781 cm3, respectively, with a significant p value of 0.0001. Histologic response was seen in 80% of patients. At a median followup of 15 months (range = 5-35), limb salvage was achieved in 82.5%. Procedure-related complications were limited and easily managed. Conclusion(s): Isolated limb infusion with doxorubicin is a simple and safe method of regional chemotherapy. The addition of preoperative external beam irradiation helped to increase the rate of limb salvage in patients with large and/or high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. © 2006 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded

The zinc level is different in patients with thalassemias. This study aimed to determine the zinc status and its relationship with demographic factors and chelation therapy in beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) patients. This cross-sectional study was conducted on 102 beta-thalassemia (beta-thal), patients. Zinc level was evaluated in subjects using the atomic absorption method. The results were analyzed through descriptive statistics, chi 2 and Mann-Whitney U tests. Of 102 cases, 92 patients were eligible and evaluated. The mean age was 23 (minimum 11, maximum 43) years. Forty-six percent of cases were males and 54.0% were females. Of the 92 patients taking iron chelators, 29.3% used deferoxamine (DFO), 16.3% deferasirox (DFX), 20.6% DFO and deferiprone (DFP), and 33.8% DFO and DFP. All cases had zinc deficiency, 89.1% had zinc levels <40.0 mg/dL, and 10.9% with zinc levels >40.0 mg/dL. There was a significant relationship between gender and group with zinc levels greater than 40.0 mg/dL and those with less than 40.0 mg/dL. Zinc deficiency is highly prevalent among patients with thalassemia in the city of Yasuj, Iran. There was a significant relationship between zinc levels and gender although no significance was observed between zinc level and age, body mass index (BMI), ferritin, and chelation factors; it is recommended that these patients be periodically evaluated for zinc level. In case of a lack of laboratory evaluation, the use of prophylactic zinc supplementation should be considered for these patients.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded

A dose of 3000 rads of betatron X-rays produced a mutation rate of 4.36 X 10(-8) per rad/locus. Among the mutations observed, 66% were recessive lethals and 34% viable when homozygous. Only one of the 24 viable mutations was associated with a chromosome aberration. Among the 47 recessive lethals, no two-break aberrations were detected in 48.9% of the lethals, deletions were associated with 42.2%, inversions with 6.7% and translocations with 2.2%.-When these genetic results are compared to those for 250 KV X-rays, the mutation rate for betatron treatments was slightly lower (.76), the recessive lethal rate among induced mutations was higher, and the chromosome aberrations among lethal mutations were slightly lower than with 250 KV X-rays.

753,"Postoperative chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancer-a phase I-II study of radiotherapy with dose escalation of weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine chemotherapy Background: Postoperative chemoradiotherapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil improves gastric cancer outcome. We previously demonstrated that chemoradiotherapy with a more intensified-and therefore potentially more effective-schedule with daily cisplatin and oral capecitabine is feasible. Because such an intensive schedule requires an extensive logistic infrastructure which is not available in every hospital, we additionally investigated the tolerability of this combined regimen with weekly instead of daily cisplatin in a dose-escalation study. Patients and Methods: After R0 or R1 resection, treatment initiated with capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 b.i.d. for 2 weeks and 1-week rest. Subsequently, patients received capecitabine (575-650 mg/m2 orally b.i.d., 5 days/week) and cisplatin (20-25 mg/m2 i.v., once weekly) according to a predefined dose-escalation schedule concurrent with radiation. Radiotherapy was given to a fixed total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. Result(s): Thirty-one patients were eligible and started treatment. During chemoradiotherapy, seven patients developed 10 items of grade III and one episode of grade IV (mainly hematological) toxicity (National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0). The maximum tolerable dose was determined to be for cisplatin 20 mg/m2 i.v. weekly and for capecitabine 575 mg/m2 b.i.d. orally. Conclusion(s): This phase I-II study demonstrated that postoperative chemoradiotherapy with weekly cisplatin and daily capecitabine is feasible in gastric cancer at the defined dose level.

483,"Occupational risk factors and reproductive health of women BACKGROUND: This in-depth review summarizes and interprets the available recent epidemiologic evidence on the relationship between occupational exposures and negative reproductive outcome among women workers. METHODS: The studies examined by the review include those published in the international scientific literature since 1990, and were identified through the search of relevant data banks using selected keywords. RESULTS: From the examination of studies dealing with exposures of women to chemical agents, pesticides, physical agents, ergonomic factors and stress, it appears that at present the evidence is sufficient to warrant the maximum protection of pregnant women to several well-documented occupational risk factors. These include exposures to anaesthetic gases, antineoplastic drugs, heavy metals, solvents, heavy physical work and irregular work schedules. For other work risks, such as exposure to non-ionizing radiation and psychosocial work stress, the evidence is often suggestive but not conclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Policy makers and health professionals should advise women and employers to avoid exposure to the well-known occupational risk factors, while epidemiologic research should pursue methodological improvements and provide more insight into the magnitude of exposures responsible for detrimental effects.

354,"Left bundle branch block and suspected myocardial infarction: Does chronicity of the branch block matter? Background: Our aim was to investigate if patients with suspected myocardial infarction (MI) and a new or presumed new left bundle branch block (nLBBB) were treated according to the ESC reperfusion guidelines and to compare them with patients having a previously known LBBB (oLBBB). Furthermore, we investigated the prevalence of ST-segment concordance in this population. Method(s): Retrospective data was collected from the Swedeheart registry for patients admitted to the cardiac care unit at Orebro University Hospital with LBBB and suspected MI during 2009 and 2010. The patients were divided in two age groups; <80 or >=80 years and analysed for LBBB chronicity (nLBBB or oLBBB), MI, and reperfusion treatment. We also compared our data with the national Swedeheart database for 2009. Result(s): A total of 99 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A diagnosis of MI was significantly more common in the group >=80 years compared to the group <80 years (53.8 vs. 25%, p=0.007). The rate of MI was similar in the groups with nLBBB and oLBBB (33 and 37% respectively, p=0.912). Of the 36 patients with a final diagnosis of MI, only eight (22%) had nLBBB. Reperfusion treatment, defined as an acute coronary angiography with or without intervention, was significantly more often performed in patients with nLBBB compared to patients with oLBBB (42 vs. 8%, p<0.001). The rate of MI and reperfusion treatment did not differ between our institution and the Swedish national data. ST-concordance was present in only two cases, one of which did not suffer an MI. Conclusion(s): The proportion of patients receiving reperfusion treatment was low, but higher in nLBBB, reflecting a partial adherence to the guidelines. We found no correlation between LBBB chronicity and MI. Furthermore, only a minority of the MIs occurred in patients with nLBBB. ST-concordance was found in only one of 36 MI cases, indicating lack of sensitivity for this test. © The European Society of Cardiology 2013.",Excluded
1854,"Severity of radiation pneumonitis, from clinical, dosimetric and biological features: a pilot study Background and objective: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) could be a lethal complication of lung cancer treatment. No reliable predictors of RP severity have been recognized. This prospective pilot study was performed to identify early predictors of high grade lung toxicity and to evaluate clinical, biological or dosimetric features associated with different grades of toxicity. Method(s): Sixteen patients with non-small cell lung cancer with indication of concurrent chemoradiotherapy using 60 Gy/2 Gy/fraction starting at cycle one of platinum based chemotherapy were included. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), pulmonary function testing (PFT), and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron-emission tomography was performed before radiotherapy (RT), after three weeks of treatment, and two months post-RT. For analysis, patients were grouped by grade (low [G1-G2] vs. high [G3-G5]). The two groups were compared to identify predictors of RP. Protein expression BAL and lung tissue metabolism was evaluated in two patients (RP-G1 vs. RP-G3). Categorical variables such as comorbidities, stages and locations were summarized as percentages. Radiation doses, pulmonary function values and time to RP were summarized by medians with ranges or as means with standard deviation. Longitudinal analysis PFT was performed by a T-test. Result(s): All 16 patients developed RP, as follows: G1 (5 pts; 31.3%); G2 (5 pts; 31.3%); G3 (5 pts; 31.3%); and G5 (1 pts; 6.1%). Patients with high grade RP presented significant decrease (p = 0.02) in diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) after three weeks of RT. No correlation between dosimetric values and RP grades was observed. BAL analysis of the selected patients showed that CXCL-1, CD154, IL-1ra, IL-23, MIF, PAI-1 and IFN-gamma were overexpressed in the lungs of the RP-G3 patient, even before treatment. The pre-RT SUVmax value in the RP-G3 patient was non-significantly higher than in the patient with RP-G1. Conclusion(s): RT induces some degree of RP. Our data suggest that decrease in DLCO% is the most sensitive parameter for the early detection of RP. Moreover, we detect biological differences between the two grades of pneumonitis, highlighting the potential value of some cytokines as a prognostic marker for developing high grade lung toxicity. Further multicenter studies with larger sample size are essential to validate these findings.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded

For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 groups. JNJ7777120 and JNJ7777120-irradiated groups received a daily subcutaneous JNJ7777120 injection (10 mg/kg) starting 24 h before irradiation. Irradiated groups received a single dose of 5 Gy on whole-body using Cesium-137 source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after irradiation. Tissues were removed, fixed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin or PAS staining and histological characteristics were evaluated. Proliferative and apoptotic markers were studied by immunohistochemistry, while micronucleus assay was performed to evaluate DNA damage. Submandibular gland (SMG) function was evaluated by methacholine-induced salivation. Results indicate that JNJ7777120 treatment diminished mucosal atrophy and preserved villi and the number of crypts after radiation exposure (240+/-8 vs. 165+/-10, P<0.01). This effect was associated to a reduced apoptosis and DNA damage in intestinal crypts. JNJ7777120 reduced radiation-induced aplasia, preserving medullar components and reducing formation of micronucleus and also it accelerated bone marrow repopulation. Furthermore, it reduced micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood (27+/-8 vs. 149+/-22, in 1,000 erythrocytes, P<0.01). JNJ7777120 completely reversed radiation-induced reduced salivation, conserving glandular mass with normal histological appearance and reducing apoptosis and atrophy of SMG. JNJ7777120 exhibits radioprotective effects against radiation-induced cytotoxic and genotoxic damages in small intestine, SMG and hematopoietic tissues and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing radiotherapy.",Included

984,"Cancer incidence in professional flight crew and air traffic control officers: disentangling the effect of occupational versus lifestyle exposures Flight crew are occupationally exposed to several potentially carcinogenic hazards; however, previous investigations have been hampered by lack of information on lifestyle exposures. The authors identified, through the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority medical records, a cohort of 16,329 flight crew and 3,165 air traffic control officers (ATCOs) and assembled data on their occupational and lifestyle exposures. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer incidence in each occupation to that of the general population; internal analyses were conducted by fitting Cox regression models. All-cancer incidence was 20-29% lower in each occupation than in the general population, mainly due to a lower incidence of smoking-related cancers [SIR (95% CI) = 0.33 (0.27-0.38) and 0.42 (0.28-0.60) for flight crew and ATCOs, respectively], consistent with their much lower prevalence of smoking. Skin melanoma rates were increased in both flight crew (SIR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.45-2.38) and ATCOs (2.66; 1.55-4.25), with rates among the former increasing with increasing number of flight hours (p-trend = 0.02). However, internal analyses revealed no differences in skin melanoma rates between flight crew and ATCOs (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% CI = 0.37-1.66) and identified skin that burns easily when exposed to sunlight (p = 0.001) and sunbathing to get a tan (p = 0.07) as the strongest risk predictors of skin melanoma in both occupations. The similar site-specific cancer risks between the two occupational groups argue against risks among flight crew being driven by occupation-specific exposures. The skin melanoma excess reflects sun-related behaviour rather than cosmic radiation exposure. Copyright © 2012 UICC.",Excluded
189,"Sex-Specific Effects of a Wartime-Like Radiation Exposure on Cognitive Function Evaluating the risk for central nervous system (CNS) effects after whole-body or partial-body irradiation presents challenges due in part to the varied exposure scenarios in the context of occupational, accidental or wartime releases. Risk estimations are further complicated by the fact that robust changes in brain function are unlikely to manifest until significantly late post exposure times. Collectively, the current data regarding CNS radiation risk are conflicting in humans and a survey of the animal model data shows that it is similarly inconsistent. Due to the sparseness of such data, the current study was conducted using male and female mice to evaluate the brain for the delayed effects of a 2 Gy whole-body exposure to c rays starting six months postirradiation. Behavioral testing indicated sex-specific differences in the induction of anxiety-like behaviors and in the ability to abolish fear memories. Molecular analyses showed alterations in post-synaptic protein levels that might affect synaptic plasticity and increased levels of global DNA methylation, suggesting a potential epigenetic mechanism that might contribute to radiation-induced cognitive dysfunction. These data add to the understanding of the CNS response to whole-body irradiation and may lead to improved risk assessment and provide guidance in the development of effective radiation countermeasures to protect military personnel and civilians alike.",Included
597,"Association between radiation dose and pathological complete response after preoperative radiochemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer Aim: This study was undertaken to examine the impact of radiation dose on pathological complete response (pCR) rates following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (N-RCT) for squamous cell esophageal cancer (ESCC). Patients and Methods: From 1988 to 2011, 218 patients were treated with 30-30.6 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction), 39.6-40 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) or 44-45 Gy (1.8-2 Gy per fraction) and concomitant cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin + 5-FU or 5-FU alone. The most commonly used concomitant chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-FU-Alone with a dose of 300 mg/m2/day during the whole course of treatment (n=111). To eliminate the dispersing effect of potentially different efficacy levels of these drug regimens on pCR, we excluded patients with regimens other than 5-FU-Alone. Result(s): Histomorphological regression grade 1a (0% residual tumor), 1b (<10% residual tumor), 2 (10-50% residual tumor) and 3 (>50% residual tumor) was observed in 26 (23%), 24 (22%), 36 (32%) and 25 (23%) patients, respectively. pCR was observed in 9 out of 71 (13%) patients treated with 30 Gy-30.6 Gy, 13 of 34 (38%) patients treated with 39.6-40 Gy and 4 of 6 (67%) patients treated with 44-45 Gy (p=0.001). Median follow-up time from the start of N-RCT was 191 months (range=2-262 months). The estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) was 33% for the whole cohort. OS at 5 years was 58% for patients with pCR compared to 25% for patients with less favorable response to N-RCT (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion(s): The dose of radiation correlates significantly with the likelihood of achieving a pCR in stage II/III squamous cell esophageal cancer patients. Prospective randomized trials are required to definitively evaluate the impact of application of higher radiation doses on efficacy and safety/tolerability in the context of N-RCT on the clinical outcomes.",Excluded
993,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of symptomatic brainstem cavernous malformations OBJECT: The authors performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data to evaluate the safety and efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of patients harboring symptomatic solitary cavernous malformations (CMs) of the brainstem that bleed repeatedly and are high risk for resection. METHOD(S): Between 1988 and 2005, 68 patients (34 males and 34 females) with solitary, symptomatic CMs of the brainstem underwent Gamma Knife surgery. The mean patient age was 41.2 years, and all patients had suffered at least 2 symptomatic hemorrhages (range 2-12 events) before radiosurgery. Prior to SRS, 15 patients (22.1%) had undergone attempted resection. The mean volume of the malformation treated was 1.19 ml, and the mean prescribed marginal radiation dose was 16 Gy. RESULT(S): The mean follow-up period was 5.2 years (range 0.6-12.4 years). The pre-SRS annual hemorrhage rate was 32.38%, or 125 hemorrhages, excluding the first hemorrhage, over a total of 386 patient-years. Following SRS, 11 hemorrhages were observed within the first 2 years of follow-up (8.22% annual hemorrhage rate) and 3 hemorrhages were observed in the period after the first 2 years of follow-up (1.37% annual hemorrhage rate). A significant reduction (p < 0.0001) in the risk of brainstem CM hemorrhages was observed following radiosurgical treatment, as well as in latency period of 2 years after SRS (p < 0.0447). Eight patients (11.8%) experienced new neurological deficits as a result of adverse radiation effects following SRS. CONCLUSION(S): The results of this study support a role for the use of SRS for symptomatic CMs of the brainstem, as it is relatively safe and appears to reduce rebleeding rates in this high-surgical-risk location.",Excluded
426,"Nasal mucociliary clearance after radiation therapy Irradiation has been demonstrated to cause decreased mucociliary clearance in animal models. We sought to verify this effect clinically by using the saccharin transport test to evaluate nasal mucociliary clearance in 9 patients previously treated with radiation therapy to the nasal cavity. The patients also completed a questionnaire examining the prevalence of nasal symptoms before and after radiation therapy. Patients who received radiation therapy had no clearance of saccharin from the nasal cavity at a minimum of 20 minutes. The controls had a median clearance time of 5 minutes. The patients noted a higher prevalence of nasal congestion, drainage, and facial pain after radiation therapy. This study demonstrates that radiation therapy to the nasal cavity causes a decrease in nasal mucociliary clearance. This alteration should be considered when selecting therapy for malignancies in the nasal area.",Excluded
438,"Hippocampal avoidance with volumetric modulated arc therapy in melanoma brain metastases - the first Australian experience PURPOSE: Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can deliver intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) like dose distributions in a short time; this allows the expansion of IMRT treatments to palliative situations like brain metastases (BMs). VMAT can deliver whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with hippocampal avoidance and a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) to achieve stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for BMs. This study is an audit of our experience in the treatment of brain metastases with VMAT in our institution., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Metastases were volumetrically contoured on fused diagnostic gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted MRI/planning CT images. Risk organs included hippocampus, optic nerve, optic chiasm, eye, and brain stem. The hippocampi were contoured manually as one paired organ with assistance from a neuroradiologist. WBRT and SIB were integrated into a single plan., RESULTS: Thirty patients with 73 BMs were treated between March 2010 and February 2012 with VMAT. Mean follow up time was 3.5 months. For 26 patients, BMs arose from primary melanoma and for the remaining four patients from non-small cell lung cancer (n= 2), primary breast cancer, and sarcoma. Mean age was 60 years. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Five patients were treated without hippocampal avoidance (HA) intent. The median WBRT dose was 31 Gy with a median SIB dose for BMs of 50 Gy, given over a median of 15 fractions. Mean values for BMs were as follows: GTV = 6.9 cc, PTV = 13.3 cc, conformity index = 8.6, homogeneity index = 1.06. Mean and maximum hippocampus dose was 20.4 Gy, and 32.4 Gy, respectively, in patients treated with HA intent. Mean VMAT treatment time from beam on to beam off for one fraction was 3.43 minutes, which compared to WBRT time of 1.3 minutes. Twenty out of 25 assessable lesions at the time of analysis were controlled. Treatment was well tolerated; grade 4 toxicity was reported in one patient. The median overall survival was 9.40 months, CONCLUSIONS: VMAT for BMs is feasible, safe and associated with a similar survival times and toxicities to conventional SRT+/-WBRT. The advantage of VMAT is that WBRT and SRT can be delivered at the same time on one machine.",Excluded

1683,"Influence of preoperative femoral orientation on radiographic measures of femoral head height in total hip replacement Background: In total hip arthroplasty the surgeon aims to restore the biomechanics of the joint. Femoral height has the greatest influence on restoring limb length and contributes equally to the restoration of femoral head centre. On X-ray, the level of femoral neck resection is most often referenced off the upper border of lesser trochanter. Less frequently, femoral head centre is referenced from the tip of the greater trochanter. The error in measurement of femoral height resulting from unknown femoral rotation is crucially important and can result in inappropriate surgical planning for implant selection and placement. It is unknown which reference produces lower error. Method(s): A sample of femoral shapes was generated using a femoral statistical shape model. These were placed in a range of orientations in terms of external rotation and flexion, at intervals of 10degree. Simulated X-rays were then produced and the distances from the tip of either greater or lesser trochanter to femoral head centre were measured. Finding(s): Although using greater trochanter as a reference demonstrated greater errors at the extremes, both techniques resulted in errors of 7-8 mm with 20degree of both femoral external rotation and flexion. Interpretation(s): Moderate degrees of femoral external rotation combined with flexion can result in unsatisfactory errors when templating limb length. There should be greater focus and an agreed definition for femoral height. There is a clinical need for a method with a lower error in determining true femoral height and the level of neck resection.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded

Assessment of life quality and accelerated biological aging of accident liquidators] In this paper, some final results of 25-year investigations carried out in Scientific Centre for Radiation Medicine and Burns MH RA (SCRMB) on the Armenian cohort of the Chernobyl accident consequences liquidators are shown. These results show that health conditions of the liquidators became worse during the whole observation period. A considerable development of both pathological states atypical of radiation damages and diseases, which may be considered as radiation-induced ones, was determined. Rise of the sickness rate of almost all organism systems, first of all, nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive ones, was observed. In 70% of liquidators the main disease was primarily detected after working on CNPP. In the intervening years, the average number of diagnoses per 1 liquidator increased from 1.5 in 1987 to 7-8 in the recent time. In addition to the detected diseases, particular functional shifts in neuropsychological and vegetative status of the liquidators were observed. The overwhelming majority of them have increased tonicity of the sympathetic vegetative nervous system, asthenic and depressive syndromes occurring in the form of weakness, somnolence, mood instability, mental capacity decrease, and memory defects. In the paper, the results of investigations aimed at clarification of changes in biological aging processes of the liquidators and assessment of their ""life quality"" features in terms of physical, psychical and social welfare are considered. Biological aged-related passportization in a definite part of liquidators elucidated an accelerated aging rate.

2538,"Projected lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea BACKGROUND: Timely assessment of cancer risk from current radiation exposure among medical radiation workers can contribute to the development of strategies to prevent excessive occupational radiation exposure. The purpose of the present study is to estimate the lifetime risk of cancers induced by occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers., METHODS: Using estimated organ doses and the RadRAT risk assessment tool, the lifetime cancer risk was estimated among medical radiation workers who were enrolled in the Korean National Dose Registry from 1996 to 2011. Median doses were used for estimating the risk because of the skewed distribution of radiation doses. Realistic representative exposure scenarios in the study population based on sex, job start year, and occupational group were created for calculating the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR)., RESULTS: The mean estimated lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure varied significantly by sex and occupational group. The highest LAR was observed in male and female radiologic technologists who started work in 1991 (264.4/100,000 and 391.2/100,000, respectively). Female workers had a higher risk of radiation-related excess cancer, although they were exposed to lower radiation doses than male workers. The higher LAR among women was attributable primarily to excess breast and thyroid cancer risks. LARs among men were higher than women in most other cancer sites. With respect to organ sites, LAR of colon cancer (44.3/100,000) was the highest in male radiologic technologists, whereas LAR of thyroid cancer (222.0/100,000) was the highest in female radiologic technologists among workers who started radiologic practice in 1991. Thyroid and bladder cancers had the highest LFR among radiologic technologists., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an assessment of the potential cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among medical radiation workers, based on current knowledge about radiation risk. Although the radiation-related risk was small in most cases, it varied widely by sex and occupational group, and the risk would be underestimated due to the use of median, rather than mean, doses. Therefore, careful monitoring is necessary to optimize radiation doses and protect medical radiation workers from potential health risks, particularly female radiologic technologists.",Included

INTRODUCTION: For the induction therapy of non-small-cell lung cancer, we need to look for a regimen which produces a reliable high response rate with a low treatment related morbidity and mortality., METHODS: Patients in clinical stages IB, IIA and B, IIIA and B received a course of therapy with 20Gy of radiation in 2 weeks. This was followed by two courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel 180mg/m(2), cisplatin 45mg/m(2), and ifosfamide 1000mg/m(2). Two to 3 weeks after chemotherapy, the patients were re-evaluated and, if suitable, underwent surgical therapy., RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were entered into the study. The overall response rate was 82.86% (95% confidence interval, 66.35-94.5%). Complete response (CR) was 20% (95% confidence interval, 8.44-36.94%). Twenty-five patients had surgical resection. Subsequently 18 patients received completion radiotherapy of additional 45Gy. The median follow up is 30 months. In 12 patients with stages IB, IIA and B, the median survival was 61 months, and 5-year survival was 55%. In 23 patients with stages IIIA and B, the median survival was 26 months, and 5-year survival was 9.5%. There was 1 patient with Grade 4 and 13 patients with Grade 3 leukopenia, and half of them received granulocyte colony stimulating factor. By the completion radiotherapy, 6 out of 18 patients had less than Grade 2 esophagitis. Five patients had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis and one Grade 5 (one mortality). There was no postoperative death. The survival results were comparable to those reported recently by others, however the regimen produced a high response rate with low treatment related morbidity/mortality., CONCLUSION: It is a suitable regimen for induction therapy to include earlier stage resectable non-small-cell lung cancers.",Excluded
1392,"Chernobyl birds have smaller brains BACKGROUND: Animals living in areas contaminated by radioactive material from Chernobyl suffer from increased oxidative stress and low levels of antioxidants. Therefore, normal development of the nervous system is jeopardized as reflected by high frequencies of developmental errors, reduced brain size and impaired cognitive abilities in humans. Alternatively, associations between psychological effects and radiation have been attributed to post-traumatic stress in humans., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: Here we used an extensive sample of 550 birds belonging to 48 species to test the prediction that even in the absence of post-traumatic stress, there is a negative association between relative brain size and level of background radiation. We found a negative association between brain size as reflected by external head volume and level of background radiation, independent of structural body size and body mass. The observed reduction in brain size in relation to background radiation amounted to 5% across the range of almost a factor 5,000 in radiation level. Species differed significantly in reduction in brain size with increasing background radiation, and brain size was the only morphological character that showed a negative relationship with radiation. Brain size was significantly smaller in yearlings than in older individuals., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low dose radiation can have significant effects on normal brain development as reflected by brain size and therefore potentially cognitive ability. The fact that brain size was smaller in yearlings than in older individuals implies that there was significant directional selection on brain size with individuals with larger brains experiencing a viability advantage.",Included

Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 1550 consecutive CT KUB studies requested for suspected renal colic carried out at a single institution in a calendar year. The data was analyzed for demographic characteristics, referring clinician and final diagnosis. Only patients with CT as primary imaging for clinically suspected reno-ureteral colic were included. Departments ordering these CT KUB examinations were divided into three divisions: Urologist, emergency room (ER) physician and others. Result(s): Of 1550 CT KUB performed in the study period 766 met the inclusion criteria. Urologists (57%), followed by ER physicians (30%) mostly ordered the examination. The overall positive yield for urolithiasis was 64% (n = 490), rate of incidental/alternate findings was 15% (n = 116) and 21% (n = 160) were negative. Urologist has the highest positive yield of 67.4% (n = 295) followed by ER physician 67% (n = 152) and others 42.5% (n = 43); p < 0.001.

The reasons of these differences are not well understood. Our aim was to appraise the determinants of operator radiation exposure during coronary right transradial procedures., METHODS: Patient arrangement during transradial intervention was investigated across operators involved in the RAD-MATRIX trial. Operator radiation exposure was analyzed according to the position of the patient right arm (close or far from the body) and in relation to the size of the upper leaded glass., RESULTS: Among the 14 operators who agreed to participate, there was a greater than 10-fold difference in radiation dose at thorax level (from 21.5 to 267 muSv) that persisted after normalization by dose-area product (from 0.35 to 3.5 muSv/Gy*cm2). Among the operators who positioned the instrumented right arm far from the body (110.4 muSv, interquartile range 71.5-146.5 muSv), thorax dose was greater than that in those who placed the instrumented arm close to the right leg (46.1 muSv, 31.3-56.8 muSv, P = .02). This difference persisted after normalization by dose-area product (P = .028). The use of a smaller full glass shield was also associated with a higher radiation exposure compared with a larger composite shield (147.5 and 60 muSv, respectively, P = .016)., CONCLUSIONS: In the context of the biggest radiation study conducted in patients undergoing transradial catheterization, the instrumented right arm arrangement close to the leg and greater upper leaded shield dimensions were associated with a lower operator radiation exposure. Our findings emphasize the importance of implementing simple preventive measures to mitigate the extra risks of radiation exposure with right radial as compared with femoral access.

1620,"Developmental defects and male sterility in mice lacking the ubiquitin-like DNA repair gene mHR23B mHR23B encodes one of the two mammalian homologs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD23, a ubiquitin-like fusion protein involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER). Part of mHR23B is complexed with the XPC protein, and this heterodimer functions as the main damage detector and initiator of global genome NER. While XPC defects exist in humans and mice, mutations for mHR23A and mHR23B are not known. Here, we present a mouse model for mHR23B. Unlike XPC-deficient cells, mHR23B(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts are not UV sensitive and retain the repair characteristics of wild-type cells. In agreement with the results of in vitro repair studies, this indicates that mHR23A can functionally replace mHR23B in NER. Unexpectedly, mHR23B(-/-) mice show impaired embryonic development and a high rate (90%) of intrauterine or neonatal death. Surviving animals display a variety of abnormalities, including retarded growth, facial dysmorphology, and male sterility. Such abnormalities are not observed in XPC and other NER-deficient mouse mutants and point to a separate function of mHR23B in development. This function may involve regulation of protein stability via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway and is not or only in part compensated for by mHR23A.",Excluded
717,"Patient perceptions of computed tomographic imaging and their understanding of radiation risk and exposure STUDY OBJECTIVE: We describe patient perceptions of computed tomography (CT) and their understanding of radiation exposure and risk., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of acute abdominal pain patients aged 18 years or older. Confidence in medical evaluations with increasing levels of laboratory testing and imaging was rated on a 100-point visual analog scale. Knowledge of radiation exposure was ascertained when participants compared the radiation dose of one abdomen-pelvis CT with 2-view chest radiography. To assess cancer risk knowledge, participants rated their agreement with these factual statements: Approximately 2 to 3 abdominal CTs give the same radiation exposure as experienced by Hiroshima survivors"" and ""2 to 3 abdominal CTs over a person's lifetime can increase cancer risk."" Previous CT was also assessed., RESULTS: There were 1,168 participants, 67% women and mean age 40.7 years (SD 15.9 years). Median confidence in a medical evaluation without ancillary testing was 20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 16 to 25) compared with 90 (95% CI 88 to 91) when laboratory testing and CT were included. More than 70% of participants underestimated the radiation dose of CT relative to chest radiography, and cancer risk comprehension was poor. Median agreement with the Hiroshima statement was 13 (95% CI 10 to 16) and 45 (95% CI 40 to 45) with the increased lifetime cancer risk statement. Seven hundred ninety-five patients reported receiving a previous CT. Of 365 patients who reported no previous CT, 142 (39%) had one documented in our electronic medical record., CONCLUSION: Patients are more confident when CT imaging is part of their medical evaluation but have a poor understanding of the concomitant radiation exposure and risk and underestimate their previous imaging experience.

1224,"Effects of a static magnetic field on audiogenic seizures in black Swiss mice Effects of a static magnetic field (SMF) with strong gradient components were studied in black Swiss mice. Exposure to SMF (100-220 mT, 15-40 T/m for 1h) did not affect the threshold for detecting auditory brainstem responses. Serial seizures elevated the hearing threshold at some frequencies, but there was no difference between SMF-exposed and unexposed control mice. EEG changes were recorded during audiogenic seizures. Pretreatment with SMF prolonged seizure latency in response to stimulation with white noise of increasing intensity from 74 to 102 dBA (1 min interval between 2 and 4 dBA increments) without significant effects on seizure severity. Gender-related differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation with 10 min sound steps revealed prolongation of latency and reduction of seizure severity in SMF-exposed, but not unexposed, mice. Pretreatment with phenytoin (5 mg/kg) in combination with SMF had significantly greater effects on seizure latency and severity than either pretreatment alone. These findings indicate that the SMF studied here under different conditions elevated seizure threshold and had anticonvulsant properties in Black Swiss mice and increased the efficacy of a conventional anticonvulsant drug.",Excluded
3417,"Analysis of acute radiation-induced esophagitis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients using the Lyman NTCP model PURPOSE: To analyze acute esophagitis (AE) in a Chinese population receiving 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combined or not with chemotherapy (CT), using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 Chinese patients (pts) presented with NSCLC received 3DCRT: alone (34 pts) or combined with sequential CT (59 pts) (group 1) or with concomitant CT (64 pts) (group 2). Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of AE were: NTCP (p<0.001) and V(50), as continuous variable (RR=1.03, p=0.03) or being more than a threshold value of 11% (RR=3.6, p=0.009)., CONCLUSIONS: A LKB NTCP model has been established to predict AE in a Chinese population, receiving thoracic RT, alone or combined with CT. The parameters of the models appear slightly different than the previous one described in Western countries, with a lower volume effect for Chinese patients. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

1,"Modifying Effect of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis on Radiation Risk for Noncardia Gastric Cancer According to Histological Type The findings from previously published studies have suggested that radiation exposure is associated with increased mortality and incidence of gastric cancer. However, few cohort studies have incorporated risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection or chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). The current study is aimed at evaluating the modifying effect of CAG on radiation risk of noncardia gastric cancer by histological type, by reanalyzing data from a nested case-control study conducted within the longitudinal clinical cohort of atomic bomb survivors. The analysis was restricted to 297 intestinal- or diffuse-type noncardia cases and 873 controls rematched to the cases on gender, age, city, and time and type of serum storage, and countermatched on radiation dose. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of noncardia gastric cancer were 3.9 (2.1-7.2) for H. pylori IgG seropositivity with cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) IgG low titer, 2.6 (1.9-3.6) for CAG, 1.9 (1.3-2.8) for current smoking, and 1.4 (1.1-1.9) for 1 Gy irradiation. Among subjects without CAG, the relative risk (95% CI) of noncardia gastric cancer at 1 Gy was 2.3 (1.4-3.7), whereas relative risk (95% CI) at 1 Gy was 1.1 (0.8-1.5) among subjects with CAG (for the overall interaction, P = 0.012). By histological type, the risk at 1 Gy was high for diffuse type without CAG, with adjusted relative risk (95% CI) of 3.8 (2.0-7.6), but was not high for diffuse type with CAG or for intestinal-type irrespective of CAG status. The results indicate that radiation exposure is associated with increased risk of diffuse-type noncardia gastric cancer without CAG, and this association exists despite adjustment for H. pylori infection and smoking habit.

237,"Disaster preparedness education and a Midwest Regional Poison Center OBJECTIVE: To assess knowledge and comfort related to disaster preparedness and response gained and retained from a disaster medicine workshop given to Certified Specialists in Poison Information (CSPI). DESIGN: A pilot study with a pre-post intervention design. SETTING: A Midwest Regional Poison Center. PARTICIPANTS: All CSPIs employed at the participating Poison Center (N = 27) were recruited. Participation ranged from 44 percent (n = 12) for the 4-month postworkshop knowledge quiz to 78 percent (n = 21) for the preworkshop survey. INTERVENTION: A disaster medicine workshop was given to the CSPIs. Quizzes and surveys were done preworkshop and then repeated at 1 week, 4 months, and 14 months postworkshop. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CSPI knowledge and comfort pertaining to disaster-related calls. RESULT(S): CSPIs' comfort levels with calls regarding major chemical or nuclear/radiation disasters significantly increased and stayed elevated during all follow-up periods [Kruskal-Wallis chi2 (3) = 13.1, p = 0.01]. The average preworkshop quiz score was 58.2 percent. A statistically significant increase in mean quiz score was demonstrated amongst preworkshop and postworkshop scores at all tested time intervals (F = 18.8, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): CSPIs' knowledge regarding disaster management significantly increased after a disaster medicine workshop, and this knowledge was significantly retained for the 14-month duration of this study. Currently, there are no uniform guidelines for Poison Centers regarding disaster response training. Studies targeted at the development of educational competencies for CSPIs and disaster response would help to standardize this much needed education.",Excluded
2901,"A new grading system for ototoxicity in adults Objective: This study aimed to propose an ototoxicity grading system sensitive to the effect of ototoxicity on specific daily life situations like speech intelligibility and the perception of ultra-high sounds and to test its feasibility compared to current criteria. Method(s): Pure tone averages (PTAs) for speech perception (1-2-4 kHz) and ultra-high frequencies (8-10-12.5 kHz) were incorporated. Threshold shift and hearing level posttreatment were taken into account. Criteria were tested on head and neck cancer patients treated with (chemo-)radiotherapy ([C]RT) and compared with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4 (CTCAEv4) and the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria (ASHA). Result(s): Grades 1 and 2 were based on threshold shifts from baseline (in dB) and subjective complaints. Grades 3 and 4 were defined as treatment-induced hearing loss of >= 35 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz and >= 70 dB at PTA 1-2-4 kHz, respectively. In high-dose cisplatin CRT incidences by the new criteria, CTCAEv4 and ASHA were comparable (78%-88%). In RT and low-dose cisplatin CRT, incidences were 36% to 39% in the new criteria versus 22% to 53% in CTCAEv4 and ASHA. Conclusion(s): The new criteria show an increased sensitivity to ototoxicity compared to CTCAEv4 and ASHA and provide insight into the effect of hearing loss on certain daily life situations. The new grading system seems feasible for clinic and research purposes.Copyright © 2014 The Author(s).",Excluded
1290,"The Aftermath of Surviving Acute Radiation Hematopoietic Syndrome and its Mitigation Intensive research is underway to find new agents that can successfully mitigate the acute effects of radiation exposure. This is primarily in response to potential counterthreats of radiological terrorism and nuclear accidents but there is some hope that they might also be of value for cancer patients treated with radiation therapy. Research into mitigation countermeasures typically employs classic animal models of acute radiation syndromes (ARS) that develop after whole-body irradiation (WBI). While agents are available that successfully mitigate ARS when given after radiation exposure, their success raises questions as to whether they simply delay lethality or unmask potentially lethal radiation pathologies that may appear later in time. Life shortening is a well-known consequence of WBI in humans and experimental animals, but it is not often examined in a mitigation setting and its causes, other than cancer, are not well-defined. This is in large part because delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) do not follow the strict time-dose phenomena associated with ARS and present as a diverse range of symptoms and pathologies with low mortality rates that can be evaluated only with the use of large cohorts of subjects, as in this study. Here, we describe chronically increased mortality rates up to 660 days in large numbers of mice given LD70/30 doses of WBI. Systemic myeloid cell activation after WBI persists in some mice and is associated with late immunophenotypic changes and hematopoietic imbalance. Histopathological changes are largely of a chronic inflammatory nature and variable incidence, as are the clinical symptoms, including late diarrhea that correlates temporally with changes in the content of the microbiome. We also describe the acute and long-term consequences of mitigating hematopoietic ARS (H-ARS) lethality after LD70/30 doses of WBI in multiple cohorts of mice treated uniformly with radiation mitigators that have a common 4-nitro-phenylsulfonamide (NPS) pharmacophore. Effective NPS mitigators dramatically decrease ARS mortality. There is slightly increased subacute mortality, but the rate of late mortalities is slowed, allowing some mice to live a normal life span, which is not the case for WBI controls. The study has broad relevance to radiation late effects and their potential mitigation and epitomizes the complex interaction between radiation-damaged tissues and immune homeostasis.Copyright © 2019 by Radiation Research Society.

3393,"Hydrogen Gas: A Novel Type of Antioxidant in Modulating Sexual Organs Homeostasis Sex is a science of cutting edge but bathed in mystery. Coitus or sexual intercourse, which is at the core of sexual activities, requires healthy and functioning vessels to supply the pelvic region, thus contributing to clitoris erection and vaginal lubrication in female and penile erection in male. It is well known that nitric oxide (NO) is the main gas mediator of penile and clitoris erection. In addition, the lightest and diffusible gas molecule hydrogen (H2) has been shown to improve erectile dysfunction (ED), testis injuries, sperm motility in male, preserve ovarian function, protect against uterine inflammation, preeclampsia, and breast cancer in female. Mechanistically, H2 has strong abilities to attenuate excessive oxidative stress by selectively reducing cytotoxic oxygen radicals, modulate immunity and inflammation, and inhibit injuries-induced cell death. Therefore, H2 is a novel bioactive gas molecule involved in modulating sexual organs homeostasis.Copyright © 2021 Yaxing Zhang et al.",Excluded

Method(s): We inspected the results of 106 patients with the diagnoses of idiopathic neuralgia that treated with percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy retrospectively. The scores of visual analog scale(VAS) were noted preoperative and postoperative periods at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months and were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean age of 106 patients was 67.31+/-8.85 years. Duration of symptoms was 19.1+/-13.1 months. Duration of symptoms did not change significantly according to gender (p=0.755), or site of trigeminal pain (p=0.158). There was not any statistical significance between gender, effected branch of trigemial nerve and side of the pain. Preoperative mean VAS score was 9.6+/-0.75. Postoperative mean VAS score values were 3.25+/-2.44 at first month, 3.23+/-2.43 at third months, 3.12+/-2.78 at sixth months and 2.59+/-3.18 at postoperative twelfth months. We found statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months VAS scores (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy is the minimally invasive treatment modality with lower complication rates and it has a high rate of efficacy when compared with invasive methods.

2475,"The effect of bone mineral density on proximal junctional failure in thoraco-lumbar fusion INTRODUCTION: Proximal junctional failure can be a catastrophic complication associated with adult spinal deformity surgery. Osteoporosis has been associated with increased risk of proximal failure. Due to regional sclerosis, spinal DEXA (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan scores have been reported as flawed and unreliable. Recently, investigators have reported on the use of CT scans as surrogates in place of spinal DEXA scores. The purpose of our study was to investigate if CT based assessments of bone mineral density can predict the possibility of proximal junctional failures. Method(s): Records of spinal deformity patients (n= 26) who had surgeries between 2007- 2012 were retrospectively reviewed from a single academic medical center. All patients included had constructs involving fusions to the pelvis and encompassing at least five lumbar levels. Indications included flat back, positive sagittal balance, and degenerative lumbar scoliosis. All patients had pre-operative standing x-rays and CT scans. Demographic data recorded included age, gender, past medical/ surgical history, diagnosed osteoporosis, and chronic steroid use with patient identifiers removed. The patients were divided into groups with proximal junctional failure (PJF) as either having progression in kyphosis over 10 degrees (proximal junctional kyphosis; PJK) or having a fracture at the proximal level. Three groups were created. Group 1 consisted of patients with no proximal junctional failure (n=16); Group 2 with PJK (n=6); and Group 3 with proximal level fracture (n=4). The CT based bone mineral density (BMD) was calculated by defining a region of interest within the vertebral body in the sagittal plane. Hounsfield units (HU) were measured within this region of interest. The vertebra at the most cranial end of the final construct was defined as the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV). Measurements were made at UIV, UIV + l(proximal), and UIV -l(distal), which is a level above and below the upper instrumented vertebra. Result(s): Statistical analysis was completed using Spss v 18. The comparison between patients with and without proximal junctional failure shows that 10/26 had failure. T5-9 was the most proximal levels for PJF (50%) and without PJF (62.5%). There was no significance comparing mean BMD between Group 1 and 2, but between Group 1 and Group 3, UIV +1 showed significance (p=0.041). The mean proximal kyphosis was 13.8 degrees (10-32 degrees). Of the four patients with proximal level fracture, two involved the vertebral body with implant back out and two had an endplate fracture. SIGNIFICANCE: Bone mineral density measured from a CT scan was an effective tool in planning the proximal extent of fusion in adult deformities. The bone mineral density values of less than 130 HU at the planned upper instrumented vertebra was a risk factor for a proximal junctional fracture. For proximal junctional kyphosis, our study found no statistical significance.",Excluded
3093,"Effects of beta radiation from organically bound tritium on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells Effects of beta radiation from four kinds of organically bound tritium compounds were investigated on cultured mouse embryonic mid brain cells, isolated from 11-d-old mouse embryos. The MBC showed a critical time when they were more radiosensitive. Although dose-dependent inhibition was found for both cellular proliferation and differentiation, the differentiation was more sensitive to radiation than proliferation when compared at ID50, the inhibitory dose that reduced assessment value by 50% of the control. Dose-dependent decrease of DNA and protein contents were also observed. The relative biological effectiveness values, ranging from 4.6 to 8.7, of beta ray from organically bound tritium compounds were obtained when compared with x irradiation at their ID50s on the inhibition of cell proliferation and differentiation, and on the decrease of DNA and protein contents of the cultures. The mixed exposure to x ray and one kind of organically bound tritium compound or to any two kinds of organically bound tritium compound resulted in a more efficiently inhibitory effect on differentiation than the exposure to x ray or to any one kind of organically bound tritium compound alone, especially when methyl-3H-thymidine was used.

2737,"Mortality from solid cancers other than lung, liver, and bone in relation to external dose among plutonium and non-plutonium workers in the Mayak Worker Cohort Exposure to ionizing radiation has well-documented long-term effects on cancer rates and other health outcomes in humans. While in vitro experimental studies had demonstrated that the nature of some radiation effects depend on both total dose of the radiation and the dose rate (i.e., the pattern of dose distribution over time), the question of whether or not the carcinogenic effect of radiation exposure depends on the dose rate remains unanswered. Another issue of interest concerns whether or not concomitant exposure to external gamma rays and inhaled plutonium aerosols has any effect on the external exposure effects. The analyses of the present paper focus on the risk of solid cancers at sites other than lung, liver, and bone in Mayak workers. Recent findings are reviewed indicating that there is no evidence of plutonium dose response for these cancers in the Mayak worker cohort. Then the evidence for differences in the external dose effects among workers with and without the potential for exposure to alpha particles from inhaled plutonium is examined. It is found that there is no evidence that exposure to plutonium aerosols significantly affects the risk associated with external exposure. While the Mayak external dose risk estimate of an excess relative risk of 0.16 per Gy is somewhat lower than an appropriately normalized risk estimate from the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, the uncertainties in these estimates preclude concluding that the external dose excess relative risks of this group of solid cancers differ in the two cohorts.",Included

This surgical technique compared to the traditional fusion techniques allows to preserve lumbar spine mobility reducing the risk of an adjacent segment disease. Aim of the study was to analyze in a retrospective way patients who underwent direct repair for isthmic spondylolysis in order to evaluate the onset of degenerative diseases or of a vertebral slippage worsening at long-term follow-up. Method(s): From 1996 to 2003 45 patients, 32 males and 13 females, underwent isthmic direct repair. Inclusion criteria were: low grade spondilolysthesis, age ranged between 11 and 25 years, low back pain from at least 6 months and resistant to conservative treatment, no degenerative diseases at the involved and adjacent level. Radiographic evaluation was performed with pre-operative lumbar x-ray and MRI and post-operative lumbar x-ray at regular intervals. In all patients the grade of degeneration at the treated and adjacent level was evaluated with the UCLA classification; the presence of an instability and the spinopelvic harmony value were also evaluated. Result(s): Median age was of 15 years (range 11-25). Median follow-up was of 12 years (10-16). Good clinical outcome was observed in the 98 % of the patients, in 2 patients an hardware failure which requested a surgical revision with a traditional fusion was observed, in 1 patient a spondylodiscitis involving the adjacent level was observed at 7 years follow-up. Radiographic analysis showed no worsening of the vertebral slippage, a complete fusion of the lysis in the 94 % of patients, no bone resorption, no statistically significant variation in the spinopelvic harmony value, a one grade worsening of the UCLA classification value only in the 10 % of patients. In these patients a concomitant alteration of the spinopelvic harmony value was observed. Nor the worsening in the UCLA classification grade none the alteration of the spinopelvic harmony influenced the clinical outcome in our series. Conclusion(s): Direct repair is a valid and reliable surgical treatment possibility for lumbar isthmic spondylolysis. Its use allows, in young symptomatic patients, to preserve the motility of the treated level in order to avoid, at over 10 years follow-up, the onset of degenerative changes to the treated and adjacent discs and zygaphofiseal joints, preserving also, a good spinopelvic harmony)over time.",Excluded
2727,"Statistical shape modeling predicts patellar bone geometry to enable stereo-radiographic kinematic tracking Complications in the patellofemoral (PF) joint of patients with total knee replacements include patellar subluxation and dislocation, and remain a cause for revision. Kinematic measurements to assess these complications and evaluate implant designs require the accuracy of dynamic stereo-radiographic systems with 3D-2D registration techniques. While tibiofemoral kinematics are typically derived by tracking metallic implants, PF kinematic measurements are difficult as the patellar implant is radiotransparent and a representation of the resected patella bone requires either pre-surgical imaging and precise implant placement or post-surgical imaging. Statistical shape models (SSMs), used to characterize anatomic variation, provide an alternative means to obtain the representation of the resected patella for use in kinematic tracking. Using a virtual platform of a stereo-radiographic system, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of an SSM to predict subject-specific 3D implanted patellar geometries from simulated 2D image profiles, and to formulate an effective data collection methodology for PF kinematics by considering accuracy for a variety of patient pose scenarios. An SSM of the patella was developed for 50 subjects and a leave-one-out approach compared SSM-predicted and actual geometries; average 3D errors were 0.45 +/- 0.07 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), which is comparable to the accuracy of traditional segmentation. Further, initial imaging of the patella in five unique stereo radiographic perspectives yielded the most accurate representation. The ability to predict the remaining patellar geometry of the implanted PF joint with radiographic images and SSM, instead of CT, can reduce radiation exposure and streamline in vivo kinematic evaluations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
1617,"A tactile display for International Space Station (ISS) extravehicular activity (EVA) Background: A tactile display to increase an astronaut's situational awareness during an extravehicular activity (EVA) has been developed and ground tested. The Tactor Locator System (TLS) is a non-intrusive, intuitive display capable of conveying position and velocity information via a vibrotactile stimulus applied to the subject's neck and torso. In the Earth's 1 G environment, perception of position and velocity is determined by the body's individual sensory systems. Under normal sensory conditions, redundant information from these sensory systems provides humans with an accurate sense of their position and motion. However, altered environments, including exposure to weightlessness, can lead to conflicting visual and vestibular cues, resulting in decreased situational awareness. The TLS was designed to provide somatosensory cues to complement the visual system during EVA operations. Method(s): An EVA task was simulated on a computer graphics workstation with a display of the International Space Station (ISS) and a target astronaut at an unknown location. Subjects were required to move about the ISS and acquire the target astronaut using either an auditory cue at the outset, or the TLS. Subjects used a 6 degree of freedom input device to command translational and rotational motion. The TLS was configured to act as a position aid, providing target direction information to the subject through a localized stimulus. Result(s): Results show that the TLS decreases reaction time (p = 0.001) and movement time (p = 0.001) for simulated subject (astronaut) motion around the ISS. Conclusion(s): The TLS is a useful aid in increasing an astronaut's situational awareness, and warrants further testing to explore other uses, tasks and configurations.",Excluded
2007,"Identification of circulating tumor cells using 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization: Validation of a noninvasive aid for ruling out lung cancer in patients with low-dose computed tomography-detected lung nodules Background: Approximately one third of needle biopsies that are performed to rule out malignancy of indeterminate pulmonary nodules detected radiologically during lung cancer screening are negative, thus exposing cancer-free patients to risks of pneumothorax, bleeding, and infection. A noninvasive confirmatory tool (eg, liquid biopsy) is urgently needed in the lung cancer diagnosis setting to stratify patients who should receive biopsy versus those who should be monitored. Method(s): A novel antigen-independent, 4-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based method was developed to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with abnormalities in gene copy numbers in mononuclear cell-enriched peripheral blood samples from patients with (n = 107) and without (n = 100) lung cancer.

2085,"Influence of image acquisition on radiation dose and image quality: Full versus narrow phase window acquisition using 320 MDCT Purpose. To compare radiation dose and image quality using predefined narrow phase window versus complete phase window with dose modulation during R-R using 320-row MDCTA. Methods. 114 patients underwent coronary CTA study using 320-row MDCT scanner. 87 patients with mean age (61 + 13 years), mean BMI (29 + 6), and mean heart rate (HR) (58 + 7 bpm) were imaged at predefined 66-80% R-R interval and then reconstructed at 75% while 27 patients with mean age (63 + 16 years), mean BMI (28 + 5), and mean HR (57 + 7 bpm) were scanned throughout the complete R-R interval with tube current modulation. The effective dose (ED) was calculated from dose length product (DLP) and conversion k (0.014 mSv/mGy/cm). Image quality was assessed using a three-point ordinal scale (1 = excellent, 2 = good, and 3 = nondiagnostic). Results. Both groups were statistically similar to each other with reference of HR (P=0.59), BMI (P=0.17), and tube current mAs (P=0.68). The median radiation dose was significantly higher in those scanned with complete R-R phase window versus narrow phase window (P<0.0001). Independently of patient and scan parameters, increased phase window was associated with higher radiation dose (P<0.001). Image quality was better among those scanned with narrow phase window versus complete phase window (P<0.0001). Conclusion. Our study supports that good HR control and predefined narrow window acquisition result in lower radiation dose without compromising diagnostic image quality for coronary disease evaluation. © 2013 Faisal Khosa et al.",Excluded
2790,"Importance of surveillance and success of salvage strategies after definitive chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. Patients and Methods: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3%, LR only in 14.5%, DM only in 15.9%, and DM plus LR in 36.2% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). Conclusion(s): Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,1 in the BMT population, approximately 8% of all patients (or 36% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded

Fifty patients at five centers underwent radio-surgery performed with a single 4-mm isocenter targeted at the nerve root entry zone. Thirty-two patients had undergone prior surgery, and the mean number of procedures that had been performed was 2.8 (range 1-7). The target dose of the radiosurgery used in the current study varied from 60 to 90 Gy. The median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 18 months (range 11-36 months). Twenty-nine patients (58%) responded with excellent control (pain free), 18 (36%) obtained good control (50%-90% relief), and three (6%) experienced treatment failure. The median time to pain relief was 1 month (range 1 day-6.7 months). Responses remained consistent for up to 3 years postradiosurgery in all cases except three (6%) in which the patients had pain recurrence at 5, 7, and 10 months. At 2 years, 54% of patients were pain free and 88% had 50% to 100% relief.

2589,"Low-dose simulation and sparse sampling with statistical iterative reconstruction: Dose reduction in MDCT-based bone mineral density and microstructure assessment Introduction: The clinical use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to assess bone strength and fracture risk in subjects with osteoporosis is limited by the relatively high radiation doses of established protocols. In this study, the effects of simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling combined with statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR) on bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and microstructure analyses of trabecular bone were assessed. We also explored whether analyses based on low-dose protocols were still able to differentiate between subjects with and without vertebral fractures. Material(s) and Method(s): In routine chest and abdominal MDCT scans of 12 subjects with prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fractures and 12 controls, pairwise matched for age and sex, lower radiation doses were simulated by virtual lower tube current (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original current) and sparse sampling (10%, 25%, and 50% of the original raw data). All images were reconstructed with SIR. BMD and trabecular bone microstructure parameters (including bone fraction and trabecular thickness) were extracted from the reconstructed images in T10 to L5. Result(s): Effective dose of the original scan was 10 mSv, and 5, 3, and 1 mSv for the 50%, 25%, and 10% sparse sampled/low-dose simulated data, respectively. All BMD measurements calculated from different virtual lower tube currents and different sparse samplings were significantly lower in subjects with fractures compared with controls (range: 89-110 versus 125-187 mg/mL; p < 0.003 for all). Analogously, bone fraction (0.31-0.47 versus 0.50-0.52; p < 0.004 for all) and trabecular thickness were consistently lower in subjects with fractures (1.1-1.3 versus 1.7-2.4 mm; p < 0.011 for all). Conclusion(s): After simulated dose reduction and sparse sampling, BMD and microstructure parameters obtained from MDCT examinations and processed with statistical iterative reconstruction were still significantly different in subjects with and without vertebral fractures, suggesting an osteoporosis diagnosis to be feasible in low-dose protocols.",Excluded
1305,"Modifications of the cutaneous microrelief in the superficial radiation-induced fibrosis: Qualitative study Cutaneous radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) is characterized by a skin retraction or atrophy, toughness to the palpation and often entails functional limitation. Its clinical evaluation remains poorly quantified. The aim of this study was to propose an analytical method to quantify RIF skin surface with the replica technique. In this preliminary study, we report the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the cutaneous microrelief in 44 healthy controls and in four patients presenting a superficial RIF, 3 to 20 years after radiotherapy for cancer. The microrelief of these RIF presented an abnormal anisotropy with a parallel reorganization of cutaneous valleys in three cases out of four, suggesting a premature radiation-induced ageing of the skin. Each subject being his own control, the relative vertical amplitude of the skin microrelief was +/- 15% in control skin. Vertical amplitude was respectively increased by 84% in one inflammatory fibrosis (3 years after RT), decreased by 18% in one evolutive fibrosis (6 years after RT), decreased by 26% in one voluminous stabilized fibrosis (8 years after BT) and decreased by 53% in one atrophic fibrosis (20 years after BT). The present study suggests that the variations of the microrelief parameters could reflect the RIF evolution. This technique requires a validation in a larger series of patients, including patients with telangiectasia.",Excluded

3054,"Efficacy of glutamine in the prevention of acute radiation enteritis: a randomized controlled trial BACKGROUND: Acute radiation enteritis is a common adverse effect related to radiotherapy (RT). Glutamine is an immune modulator and antioxidant amino acid that can exert a protective role in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic radiation. The aim of this study was to test if glutamine prevents radiation enteritis during RT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Double-blind, randomized, controlled trial including 69 patients who needed RT because of pelvic or abdominal malignancies and received glutamine (30 g/d) or placebo (casein, 30 g/d). Enteritis was evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale, intestinal inflammation using fecal calprotectin, and gut integrity with citrulline. The incidence of enteritis was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves, and the hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using Cox regression., RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (65.2%), with an average (SD) age of 66.6 (9.9) years, with urologic (44.9%), rectal (24.6%), or gynecological cancer (23.1%). More patients developed enteritis with glutamine than with the placebo (55.9% vs 22.0%; P = .002), with an HR OF 1.59 (95% confidence interval, 0.624.05). There were no differences in final calprotectin levels (glutamine, 57.9 [85.8] mg/kg vs placebo, 54.0 [57.7] mg/kg; p = .182) or the number of patients with values 50 mg/kg (glutamine, 58.1% vs placebo, 54.6%; p = .777). Final citrulline levels were similar between groups (glutamine, 26.31 [10.29] mmol/l vs placebo, 27.69 [12.31] mmol/l; p = .639), without differences in the number of patients with 20 mmol/l (glutamine, 24.1% vs placebo, 25.0%; P = .938). Citrulline concentration was reduced during rt with placebo but remained unchanged with glutamine., CONCLUSION: Glutamine does not prevent the development of enteritis during RT.",Excluded
3255,"Noninvasive evaluation of radiation-enhanced glioma cells invasiveness by ultra-high-field (1)H-MRS in vitro INTRODUCTION: Glioma is the most common type of the primary CNS tumor. Radiotherapy is an important treatment measure after surgery. However, its highly invasive character is the main reason of postoperative recurrence. The aim of the study was to probe the correlation between the invasion ability and the metabolite characteristics of glioma cells at the cellular level after irradiation by using 14.7T high-resolution nuclear proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS)., METHODS: To determine the matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity and metabolite ratios of glioma cells after irradiation with different doses of X-rays, U87 and C6 glioma cells were exposed to X-ray irradiation of 0, 1, 5, 10, and 15Gy. After 20h, the perchloric acid (PCA) extraction method was used to evaluate water-soluble metabolites [choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA)], and (1)H-MRS patterns and changes in metabolite ratios were observed in vitro by 14.7T high resolution (1)H-MRS. Matrigel invasion assays and gelatin zymography were performed to test the invasion ability of U87 and C6 glioma cells., RESULTS: Good MR spectra were obtained from PCA method extracts of U87 and C6 glioma cells. Both radiation-induced MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios increased after irradiation, and their increase occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The MMP-2 activity and the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios of glioma cells increased after irradiation up to 10Gy and decreased thereafter. In particular, the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 cells increased from 3.55+/-0.06 (0Gy) to 9.13+/-0.30 (10Gy) and then declined to 5.94+/-0.15 (15Gy). Furthermore, the invasion ability of glioma cells had a strong positive correlation with the Cho/Cr and Cho/NAA ratios. Both the Cho/Cr ratio and the Cho/NAA ratio of U87 glioma cells were highly positively correlated with the number of invading cells in the Matrigel invasion assay. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) values of U87 cells were 0.89 (Cho/Cr ratio versus invasion ability) and 0.91 (Cho/NAA ratio versus invasion ability) (P<0.01). C6 cells exhibited similar changes to those of U87 cells., CONCLUSIONS: In vitro high-resolution (1)H-MRS is useful for detecting glioma invasiveness at the cellular level. Copyright © 2016.

810,"MR-guided breast radiotherapy: feasibility and magnetic-field impact on skin dose The UMC Utrecht MRI/linac (MRL) design provides image guidance with high soft-tissue contrast, directly during radiotherapy (RT). Breast cancer patients are a potential group to benefit from better guidance in the MRL. However, due to the electron return effect, the skin dose can be increased in presence of a magnetic field. Since large skin areas are generally involved in breast RT, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effects on the skin dose, for whole-breast irradiation (WBI) and accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). In ten patients with early-stage breast cancer, targets and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated on postoperative CT scans co-registered with MRI. The OARs included the skin, comprising the first 5 mm of ipsilateral-breast tissue, plus extensions. Three intensity-modulated RT techniques were considered (2x WBI, 1x APBI). Individual beam geometries were used for all patients. Specially developed MRL treatment-planning software was used. Acceptable plans were generated for 0 T, 0.35 T and 1.5 T, using a class solution. The skin dose was augmented in WBI in the presence of a magnetic field, which is a potential drawback, whereas in APBI the induced effects were negligible. This opens possibilities for developing MR-guided partial-breast treatments in the MRL.",Excluded
939,"An application of visible human database in radiotherapy: Tutorial for image guided external radiotherapy (TIGER) Background and purpose Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy allow accurate dose delivery on target volumes. Due to the different background among specialists involved in target volume definition, the contouring emerges as one of the most questionable steps in treatment planning procedures. A software tool devoted to contouring training, named tutorial for image guided external radiotherapy ('TIGER'), based on the Visible Human Project images data-set, is described. Materials and methods TIGER is addressed to facilitate the learning of axial anatomical images, to promote the training and reproducibility in contouring process, to allow the availability of a tool to enhance the 'drill and practice' approach in training programs. TIGER includes three different environments: Anatomic tutorial devoted to facilitate a self-learning approach to axial body sections; Contouring tutorial addressed to practice contouring process of anatomical structures and to undergo a test program prepared by tutors; Teacher's tools to offer to tutors the opportunity to insert new outlines in TIGER-database, according to local needs or conventions, and to use them in tutorial programs. TIGER-database is grouped in six main anatomical sections: head and neck, male thorax, female thorax, abdomen, male pelvis, and female pelvis. Overall 432 corresponding CT-VH images and 1189 contours of 134 different anatomical structures and lymphatic drainage areas are available. The access to the TIGER software is allowed by ESTRO web site (http://www.estro.be). Conclusions TIGER provides an interactive human anatomy cross-sectional oriented source to facilitate the interpretation of CT scan images usually contoured in daily practice.

936,"State-of-the-art MR Imaging for Thoracic Diseases Since thoracic MR imaging was first used in a clinical setting, it has been suggested that MR imaging has limited clinical utility for thoracic diseases, especially lung diseases, in comparison with x-ray CT and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. However, in many countries and states and for specific indications, MR imaging has recently become practicable. In addition, recently developed pulmonary MR imaging with ultra-short TE (UTE) and zero TE (ZTE) has enhanced the utility of MR imaging for thoracic diseases in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, MR imaging has been introduced as being capable of assessing pulmonary function. It should be borne in mind, however, that these applications have so far been academically and clinically used only for healthy volunteers, but not for patients with various pulmonary diseases in Japan or other countries. In 2020, the Fleischner Society published a new report, which provides consensus expert opinions regarding appropriate clinical indications of pulmonary MR imaging for not only oncologic but also pulmonary diseases. This review article presents a brief history of MR imaging for thoracic diseases regarding its technical aspects and major clinical indications in Japan 1) in terms of what is currently available, 2) promising but requiring further validation or evaluation, and 3) developments warranting research investigations in preclinical or patient studies. State-of-the-art MR imaging can non-invasively visualize lung structural and functional abnormalities without ionizing radiation and thus provide an alternative to CT. MR imaging is considered as a tool for providing unique information. Moreover, prospective, randomized, and multi-center trials should be conducted to directly compare MR imaging with conventional methods to determine whether the former has equal or superior clinical relevance. The results of these trials together with continued improvements are expected to update or modify recommendations for the use of MRI in near future.",Excluded

This report includes a description of the automated preparation of 15O-butanol which allows repetitive activation studies, each 15 min apart. Dynamic rCBF studies were extended by prolonged measurements up to 15 min after injection over different organs such as brain, liver, kidneys and bladder. All measurements were done with a whole-body PET camera PC4096-15WB. Based on the pharmacokinetic data in 13 subjects the radiation doses to single organs were calculated according to MIRD pamphlet No. 11 and the effective dose defined by ICRP 60 as an indicator of radiation dose to the total body. The liver received the highest radiation dose of about 2.2 mGy per 1500 MBq of injected 15O-butanol, which is the typical amount of administered tracer in one rCBF measurement. The dose to the kidneys was 1.6 mGy, to the stomach 0.8 mGy, and to the brain 0.16 mGy. The effective dose was 0.54 mGy, which was similar to that of H2(15)O, but lower than the effective dose from C15O2 in amounts typically applied in human rCBF studies.",Excluded
1167,"p53 expression in human rectal tissue after radiotherapy: upregulation in normal mucosa versus functional loss in rectal carcinomas PURPOSE: In vitro, ionizing radiation of epithelial cells leads to upregulation of wild-type p53 and subsequent induction of p21(waf1). The effect of radiotherapy (RT) on the expression of these proteins in patients is unknown. We assessed the influence of RT on the expression of p53 and p21(waf1) in normal mucosa and rectal carcinomas in vivo., METHODS: Tumor and normal tissue samples were derived from rectal cancer patients randomized in a clinical trial in which the value of preoperative RT was evaluated. p53 and p21(waf1) expression was determined in 51 irradiated and 52 nonirradiated patients using immunohistochemistry., RESULTS: In normal mucosa, both p53 and p21(waf1) were strongly upregulated after RT compared with the expression in unirradiated normal tissue (p <0.001). In tumor cells, no significant difference in the expression of p53 or p21(waf1) was found in the irradiated vs. nonirradiated group. In the few rectal tumors with wild-type p53, induction of p53 after RT did not necessarily lead to upregulation of p21(waf1)., CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that in normal mucosa, a functional p53-p21(waf1) pathway is present, whereas in tumor cells it is defective in almost all cases because of either p53 mutation or down- or upstream disruption in tumors with wild-type p53. Therefore, we believe that the role of p53 expression as a single prognostic marker in rectal cancer needs reconsideration.",Included
3423,"Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Imaging Testing in US Primary Care Background: Imaging tests are one of the most sophisticated types of diagnostic tools used in health care, yet there are concerns that imaging is overused. Currently, tests are typically evaluated and implemented based on their accuracy, and there is limited knowledge about the range of patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) that imaging tests may lead to. This study explores patients' experiences and subsequent outcomes of imaging tests most notable to patients. Method(s): Adult patients from four primary care clinics who had an x-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound in the 12 months before recruitment participated in a single semistructured interview to recount their imaging experience. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Result(s): Four themes related to PCOs were identified from 45 interviews. Participants' mean age was 53 years (25-83 years), 30 had undergone a diagnostic imaging test, and 15 underwent imaging for screening or monitoring. Themes included knowledge gained from the imaging test, its contribution to their overall health care journey, physical experiences during the test procedure, and impacts of the testing process on emotions. Conclusion(s): Patients identified various imaging test outcomes that were important to them. Measurement and reporting these outcomes should be considered more often in diagnostic research. Tools for providers and patients to discuss and utilize these outcomes may help promote shared decision making around the use and impact of imaging tests.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

While research in the physics domain for Flattening Filter Free Beams (FFF) beams is increasing, there are few clinical data of FFF beams in clinical practice. Here we reported dosimentric and early clinical data of SBRT and FFF delivery in isolated lymph node oligometastatic patients. Method(s): Between October 2010 and March 2012, 34 patients were treated with SBRT for oligometastatic lymph node metastasis on a Varian TrueBeamTM treatment machine using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (RapidArc). We retrospectively evaluated a total of 25 patients for isolated lymph node metastases in abdomen and/or pelvis treated with SBRT and FFF (28 treatments). Acute toxicity was recorded. Local control evaluation was scored by means of CT scan and/or PET scan. Result(s): All dosimetric results are in line with what published for the same type of stereotactic abdominal lymph node metastases treatments and fractionation, using RapidArc. All 25 FFF SBRT patients completed the treatment. Acute gastrointestinal toxicity was minimal: one patient showed Grade 1 gastrointestinal toxicity. Three other patients presented Grade 2 toxicity. No Grade 3 or higher was recorded. All toxicities were recovered within one week. The preliminary clinical results at the median follow up of 195 days are: complete response in 12 cases, partial response in 11, stable disease in 5, with an overall response rate of 82%; no local progression was recorded. Conclusion(s): Data of dosimetrical findings and acute toxicity are excellent for patients treated with SBRT with VMAT using FFF beams. Preliminary clinical results showed a high rate of local control in irradiated lesion.

Method(s): Pretreatment T2W- and SPAIR T2W-MRI of 68 ESCC patients (37 responders, 31 nonresponders) were analyzed. A number of 138 radiomic features were extracted from each image sequence respectively. Kruskal-Wallis test were performed to evaluate the capability of each feature on treatment response classification. Sensitivity and specificity for each of the studied features were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were constructed based on the training set (23 responders, 20 nonresponders) for the prediction of treatment response, and then the testing set (14 responders, 11 nonresponders) validated the reliability of the models. Comparison between the performances of the models was performed by using McNemar's test. Result(s): Radiomic analysis showed significance in the prediction of treatment response. The analyses showed that complete responses (CRs) versus stable diseases (SDs), partial responses (PRs) versus SDs, and responders (CRs and PRs) versus nonresponders (SDs) could be differentiated by 26, 17, and 33 features (T2W: 11/11/15, SPAIR T2W: 15/6/18), respectively. The prediction models (ANN and SVM) based on features extracted from SPAIR T2W sequence (SVM: 0.929, ANN: 0.883) showed higher accuracy than those derived from T2W (SVM: 0.893, ANN: 0.861). No statistical difference was observed in the performance of the two classifiers (P=0.999).

618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones. These results suggest probable involvement of I-J-bearing suppressor T-cells in the hematopoietic disorders induced by pertussis vaccine.,Excluded

24,"Assessment of periodontal changes in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck malignancy: A hospital-based study Background: Surgical resection, radio and chemotherapy, either used singly or in combination, are the three most common modalities used in head and neck cancer treatment. These modalities are effective in eradicating the tumor; they also negatively impact the normal head and neck structures surrounding the tumor. Direct damage to the oral structures (soft and hard tissue) frequently occurs from radio and chemotherapy, and indirect damage may also arise from systemic toxicity. Material(s) and Method(s): This prospective study was designed to analyze the effect of radiotherapy on periodontal parameters in oncology patients prior to irradiation in the head and neck area, compared with 6 months following treatment. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS. Result(s): The study sample consisted of total 29 patients of head and neck malignancy (M = 17, F = 12), of mean age 45.66 years. Only 22% of patients had various habits (smoking, tobacco chewing, and alcohol consumption) and majority (27.59% patients) had tongue malignancy. All periodontal parameters-oral hygiene index Siller (OHIS), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival recession (GR), except probing pocket depth (PPD)-were significantly increased after radiotherapy. When comparison was made between doses and fractions, only in mandible statistically significant difference were observed in GR. Conclusion(s): Although there was no significant change in PPD, there was increased GR, CAL, and plaque index associated with radiotherapy. In this study, 61.5% cases of mandibular teeth and 34.4% cases of maxillary teeth showed attachment loss greater than 0.2 mm.

1266,"Pilot study trialling a new ambulatory method for the clinical assessment of regional gastrointestinal transit using multiple electromagnetic capsules BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal (GI) motor disorders often involve several regions of the GI tract. Therefore, easy and safe assessment of whole gut and regional motility is valuable for more precise diagnosis. 3D-Transit is a novel method for ambulatory evaluation of total and regional gastrointestinal transit times (GITT) based on the anatomical localization of ingestible electromagnetic capsules. The main purpose of this study was to test the performance of the 3D-Transit system., METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers each ingested three electromagnetic capsules over a period of two consecutive days. Standard radio-opaque markers (ROM) were also ingested to assess the agreement between total GITT obtained with both methods., KEY RESULTS: Investigations were well-tolerated and three capsules could be tracked simultaneously with minimal data loss (Capsule 1: median: 0.2% of time (range 0-25.3%). Region specific contraction patterns were identified and used for computation of total and regional GITT in all subjects. Inter-observer agreement was 100% for total GITT (median variation 0%) but less for regional GITT. Day-to-day and diurnal variations were significant for total and regional GITT. Total GITT assessed by 3D-Transit capsules were moderately well-correlated to those assessed with standard ROM (Spearman's rho = 0.7)., CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: 3D-transit is a well-tolerated and minimal invasive ambulatory method for assessment of GI motility. By providing both total and regional transit times, the 3D-Transit system holds great promise for future clinical studies of GI function in health and disease.

In this patient cohort with primarily advanced disease, OS, LC and DFS rates in resected patients are comparable to similarly staged, adjuvantly treated patients in randomized trials. Further study comparing neoadjuvant CRT to standard treatment approaches for gastric cancer is indicated. © 2013 Pepek et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1977,"Determinants of vitamin D status in long-term renal transplant patients In this study, we explored the determinants of vitamin D status in a large cohort of stable, Long-term renal transplant (RTx) patients. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and bone biochemistry parameters, were retrospectively analyzed from 266 RTx patients (>10 yr post-engraftment) presenting to clinic over the course of a year. Forty-five percent of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (<37.5 nM), 38% insufficient (37.5 75-nM), and 17% sufficient (>75 nM). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in patients presenting in summer (p<0.001) and in more active patients (p<0.05). RTx patients with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) (n=45) had higher 25(OH)D concentrations than patients without NMSC (n=221; p<0.05) despite these patients being older, having worse eGFR, transplanted for longer, and less active physically (p<0.05). Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with higher PTH concentrations (p<0.05) which, in the setting of widespread hypovitaminosis, suggests that secondary hyperparathyroidism was common in this cohort. In conclusion, season and activity status are important determinants of vitamin D status. We report, for the first time, that NMSC is associated with higher 25(OH)D, probably through increased UV radiation exposure. Long-term RTx patients may benefit from oral vitamin D supplementation, but this requires a randomized controlled trial to confirm. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Excluded
504,"Regulation of the metastasis of murine ocular melanoma by natural killer cells In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed. This study demonstrates the importance of the NK cell as a primary effector cell for the control of metastasis from in vivo derived ocular B16F10 melanoma.",Excluded
2925,"Tolerance of half-body irradiation as systemic therapy for patients with locally advanced breast cancer Background. Locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) is one of the main causes of cancer death among women in Bulgaria. In 1988, when this study started, there was still controversy about the role of chemotherapy in controlling systemic disease. There were encouraging results from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 82-06 study suggesting that half-body irradiation (HBI) should be used earlier in the disease course to prevent the development of metastases. There were many patients with LABC requiring treatment, but there was a problem with obtaining the drugs needed; they were expensive and not consistently available. Procedure. Taking into account the medical contraindications to chemotherapy treatment, its toxicity, and the possibility of chemoresistance, we initiated this study to look at the effects of HBI given as two fractions of 4 Gy to the upper and then lower parts of the body, after surgery and before local radiotherapy. Results. The acute tolerance of this regimen in 36 patients with LABC was as good as it was in 4 additional LABC patients with M1 disease, and hematologic recovery was satisfactory. Conclusions. We conclude that systemic treatment with HBI is tolerable. It therefore may be a convenient and cost-effective treatment for LABC, although better treatments are still needed.",Excluded
2685,"Graded exercise testing for spaceflight We developed and validated a graded exercise protocol suitable for operational use on space station. The new treadmill protocol has three level-grade stages (3-min each) at 70, 80, and 90% of estimated VO2peak. The protocol maintains the third stage speed while grade increases each minute to produce work rates equivalent to 100, 107, and 115% of the estimated VO2peak. We compared the new protocol's peak and submaximal responses to those observed during a NASA graded exercise test. All mean protocol differences, including peak work rate (-1.8%), VO2peak (-6.4%), HRpeak (-2.4%), and VEpeak (-9.7%), were not significantly different from the expected measurement errors. We observed similar results for indices (the oxygen uptake at a HR of 150 and the HR's at 70, 80, and 90% of VO2peak) of the submaximal HR-VO2 relationship. The new protocol is an acceptable graded exercise test for periodic operational fitness tests.",Excluded
1353,"An assessment of the adequacy of sunscreen usage Sunscreens are in widespread use as a form of skin protection against solar ultraviolet radiation. Previous studies provide some data to show that the amount of sunscreen applied is less than manufacturers' recommendations, although studies have often used indirect measurement techniques. This study comprised 50 volunteers who applied a standard aqueous cream as a hypoallergenic analogue for sunscreen to one of their forearms. Two novel methods of directly measuring forearm area were used, based on a mathematical model and the use of a helically wrapped cloth belt. Application amounts ranged from 0.05 mg.cm-2 to 8.38 mg.cm-2. The distribution was heavily skewed, with a modal value in the range 0.5-1.0 mg.cm-2. Of the volunteers 69% applied less than the generally accepted quantity of 2.0 mg.cm-2, with 61% applying less than 1.5 mg.cm-2, and 37% applying less than 1.0 mg.cm-2. The study confirms previous findings that most sunscreen application is not sufficient to achieve the stated sun protection factor. The use of higher factor sunscreens, a reassessment of the definition of sun protection factors and/or further public education campaigns are warranted.",Excluded
537,"Adjuvant radiotherapy for low-risk early breast cancer in elderly women: Evidence from randomized trials Breast cancer is the most common cancer pathology in women in the Western world. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years and in the coming decades it is estimated that the number of elderly women affected reaches an important percentage. This aging of the cancer population, associated with its inherent comorbidities and aggravated by the lack of consensus about the most appropriate treatment, make it difficult to administer an effective postoperative treatment in elderly women with a low-risk profile. An exhaustive geriatric evaluation is a sine qua non condition to opt for a specific type of treatment. To date, several options are available such as endocrine therapy (ET) alone, moderate/high hypofractionation and various accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques. In this article, we provide information about each of them. Copyright © 2020 Translational Cancer Research. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2391,"Incidental gonadal radiation exposure in the prophylactic treatment of heterotopic ossification Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy is commonly used for heterotopic ossification (HO) prophylaxis after the orthopedic repair of fractures involving the hip and femur. Given the young age of many of these patients presenting for treatment and the proximity of the reproductive organs to tissue requiring radiation therapy, incidental radiation exposure to the gonads must be considered for potential fertility issues. The purpose of this study was to report dosimetric gonadal exposure among a large cohort of patients who underwent 3-dimensional simulation and radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis. Materials/Methods: A total of 45 patients (38 males; 7 females) were identified that underwent volumetric CT-planned radiation therapy for HO prophylaxis using a single fraction dose of 700 cGy. The median age was 22 years (range, 12 - 55 years). Treatment plans were generated with the Pinnacle3 treatment planning system (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA) with heterogeneity corrections accounted for via convolution/superposition dose calculation algorithm. Treatments were delivered post-operatively within 48 hours using opposed AP/PA fields that generally included the surgical prosthesis as well as the femoral head, ischial ramus, and greater/lesser trochanters. Three male patients received bilateral radiation for fractures involving both hips. The simulation CT scans were retrieved from archives, and the testicles and ovaries were delineated as paired structures on 3 millimeter axial sections so that dose-volume characteristics could be determined. Result(s): The proportion of male patients receiving ipsilateral testicular doses (maximum) greater than 15 cGy, 50 cGy, and 100 cGy was 63%, 24%, and 21%, respectively. Another 20% of male patients had both testicles exposed to maximum doses greater than 15 cGy, the number commonly cited to cause sperm abnormalities. The 3 men undergoing bilateral radiation received an average maximal testicular dose of 422 cGy (range, 187 - 686 cGy). Among female patients, 86% received maximal ipsilateral ovarian doses over 15 cGy. One of the seven women received a dose exceeding 15 cGy to both ovaries (778 cGy and 31.5 cGy). Conclusion(s): Gonadal doses exceeding historically recommended tolerances can result in patients undergoing radiation for HO prophylaxis. Scrotal shields, informing patients about possible fertility issues, and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as an alternative to radiation therapy should be considered as appropriate in the management of this benign condition.",Excluded
3387,"TWO FACTORS INFLUENCING DOSE RECONSTRUCTION IN LOW DOSE RANGE: THE VARIABILITY OF BKG INTENSITY ON ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WATER CONTENT A fast and accurate retrospective dosimetry method for the triage is very important in radiation accidents. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) fingernail dosimetry is a promising way to estimate radiation dose. This article presents two factors influencing dose reconstruction in low dose range: the variability of background signal (BKG) intensity on one individual and water content. Comparing the EPR spectrum of dried and humidified fingernail samples, it is necessary to add a procedure of dehydration before EPR measurements, so as to eliminate the deviation caused by water content. Besides, the BKGs of different fingers' nails are not the same as researchers thought previously, and the difference between maximum and minimum BKG intensities of one individual can reach 55.89 %. Meanwhile, the variability of the BKG intensity among individuals is large enough to impact precise dose reconstruction. Water within fingernails and instability of BKG are two reasons that cause the inaccuracy of radiation dose reconstruction in low-dosage level.Copyright © The Author 2015.

699,"A randomized trial of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy and bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea for malignant glioma. A preliminary report of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 83-02 BACKGROUND: The third and final randomization of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 83-02 was performed to identify the maximal tolerated dose and potential efficacy of accelerated hyperfractionated radiation therapy (AHRT) in 1.6 Gy twice-daily fractions for adult malignant glioma., METHODS: From December 1987 to July 1989, 304 patients with malignant glioma were stratified by age, performance status, and histologic findings and randomized to receive total AHRT doses of 48.0 or 54.4 Gy, with 80 mg/m2 of bis-chloroethyl nitrosourea (BCNU) for 3 days every 8 weeks. Distribution of other prognostic factors, including neurologic function, extent of surgery, tumor size, and sex, was comparable in each treatment arm., RESULTS: One Grade 5 radiation therapy (RT)-related toxic effect was reported (in the 54.4-Gy treatment arm), and the incidence of late Grade 3-5 RT-related toxic effects at 18 months was 1% at 48.0 Gy and 4% at 54.4 Gy. The median survival times (MST) for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 11.7 and 10.8 months, respectively, comparable to the MST in prior RTOG trials with a similar proportion of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (79%). For the 123 patients who were 60 years of age or older, the MST for the 48.0 Gy and 54.4 Gy treatment arms were 8.9 and 10.4 months, respectively, and compare favorably with the MST of 6.0 months reported with standard RT and BCNU treatment used for 101 patients who were 60 years of age or older in two prior RTOG malignant glioma trials (74-01 and 79-18). Although these results differ significantly (P = 0.0015), this contrast is not significant when adjusted by performance status., CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose of AHRT has yet to be identified, and pursuit of this information may most benefit patients with malignant glioma who are 60 years of age or older.",Excluded
1416,"Less is More: The Impact of Multidisciplinary Thyroid Conference on the Treatment of Well-Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma BACKGROUND: In 2006, a multidisciplinary thyroid conference (MDTC) was implemented to better plan management of thyroid cancer patients at our institution. This study assessed the clinical impact of a MDTC on radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment patterns., METHODS: A prospective database (2003-2014) collected patient and tumor characteristics, RAI doses, and tumor recurrences. Patients treated with total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma >=1 cm were stratified based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk classification. RAI regimens were compared before initiation of MDTC (2003-2005, n = 88), after establishment of MDTC (2007-2009, n = 95), and after the release of 2009 ATA guidelines (2011-2014, n = 181). RAI doses were defined as low (<=75 mCi), intermediate (76-150 mCi), and high (>150 mCi)., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients who received high-dose RAI after implementation of MDTC compared to before initiation of MDTC in the intermediate and high-risk patient groups (p = 0.04 and p < 0.01) without an associated increase in tumor recurrence (11 vs. 7%, p = 0.74). On multivariable analysis, presentation of a patient at MDTC was a negative predictor for receiving high-dose RAI (p = 0.002). As might be expected, there was also a significant decrease in use of RAI after the 2009 ATA guidelines were issued compared to after implementation of MDTC (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: In conjunction with implementation of a thyroid malignancy multidisciplinary conference, we observed significantly decreased postoperative dosing of RAI without increased tumor recurrence. The 2009 ATA guidelines were associated with a further decrease in RAI administration. Treatment for patients with thyroid carcinoma is optimized by a multidisciplinary approach.",Excluded
591,"Predictors of pulmonary toxicity in limited stage small cell lung cancer patients treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and 70Gy daily radiotherapy: CALGB 30904 Introduction: Standard therapy for limited stage small cell lung cancer (L-SCLC) is concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. Predictors of post chemoradiotherapy pulmonary toxicity in limited stage (LS) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients are not well defined. Current guidelines are derived from non-small cell lung cancer regimens, and do not account for the unique biology of this disease. Therefore, we analyzed patients on three consecutive CALGB LS-SCLC trials treated with concurrent chemotherapy and daily high dose radiotherapy (70. Gy) to determine patient and treatment related factors predicting for post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Method(s): Patients treated on CALGB protocols 39808, 30002, 30206 investigating two cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and 70. Gy daily thoracic radiation therapy were pooled. Patient, tumor, and treatment related factors were evaluated to determine predictors of grade 3-5 pulmonary toxicities after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): 100 patients were included. No patient experienced grade 4-5 post-treatment pulmonary toxicity. Patients who experienced post-treatment pulmonary toxicity were more likely to be older (median age 69 vs 60, p= 0.09) and have smaller total lung volumes (2565 cc vs 3530 cc, p= 0.05).). Furthermore, exposure of larger volumes of lung to lower (median V5. = 70%, p= 0.09, median V10. = 63%, p= 0.07), intermediate (median V20. = 50, p= 0.04) and high (median V60. = 25%, p= 0.01) doses of radiation were all associated with post-treatment grade 3 pulmonary toxicity, as was a larger mean lung radiation dose (median 31. Gy) p= 0.019. Conclusion(s): Post-treatment pulmonary toxicity following the completion of 2 cycles of chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and high dose daily radiation therapy was uncommon. Care should be taken to minimize mean lung radiation exposure, as well as volumes of low, intermediate and high doses of radiation. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Excluded
1436,"Differential recovery of neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus after ionizing radiation Radiation therapy is a widely used treatment for malignant central nervous system tumors. Mature neurons are terminally differentiated, whereas stem and progenitor cells have a prominent proliferative capacity and are therefore highly vulnerable to irradiation. Our aim was to investigate how cranial radiation in young rats would affect stem/progenitor cells in the two niches of adult neurogenesis, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Nine weeks after irradiation we found that in irradiated animals, hippocampal neurogenesis was reduced to 5% of control levels. Similarly, the numbers of actively proliferating cells and radial glia-like stem cells (nestin+/glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]+) in the dentate gyrus were reduced to 10% and 15% of control levels, respectively. In the irradiated olfactory bulb, neurogenesis was reduced to 40% of control levels, and the number of actively proliferating cells in the SVZ was reduced to 53% of control levels. However, the number of nestin+/GFAP+ cells in the SVZ was unchanged compared with controls. To evaluate the immediate response to the radiation injury, we quantified the amount of proliferation in the SVZ and dentate gyrus 1 day after irradiation. We found an equal reduction in proliferating cells both in dentate gyrus and SVZ. In summary, we show an initial response to radiation injury that is similar in both brain stem cell niches. However, the long-term effects on stem cells and neurogenesis in these two areas differ significantly: the dentate gyrus is severely affected long-term, whereas the SVZ appears to recover with time.",Included
318,"Prospective Pilot Study of Consolidation Chemotherapy With Docetaxel and Cisplatin After Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Purpose: With the improvement concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in the management of patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), distant failures have become a more relevant problem in terms of survival. The primary objective of this Phase II study is to assess the feasibility of docetaxel and cisplatin consolidation after primary CCRT for patients with HNSCC. Methods and Materials: Patients with locoregionally advanced HNSCC received chemotherapy with three cycles of cisplatin, 100 mg/m2, on Days 1, 22, and 43. Concurrent radiotherapy to the primary tumor and neck was given in a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 70-70.2 Gy over 7 weeks. After completion of CCRT, patients without evidence of disease progression received an additional four cycles of consolidation chemotherapy with docetaxel, 75 mg/m2, and cisplatin, 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks. Result(s): Of 33 patients, 27 (81%) completed CCRT. After CCRT, three complete and 19 partial responses were recorded, giving an overall response rate of 67%. Of 19 patients who went to the consolidation phase, only 4 (21%) received all four cycles of docetaxel and cisplatin. Causes of failure of consolidation chemotherapy were toxicity in 11 patients, including three treatment-related deaths, and progression in 4 patients. Three patients died of sepsis during the consolidation phase. Median survival was 11 months for all patients and 8 months for those treated with consolidation chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The poor compliance and high incidence of severe toxicities prompted no further evaluation of this consolidation chemotherapy after CCRT. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

There was a control group of 20 patients (9 women, 11 men). The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) scoring system was used for grading the severity of the proctitis. Endoscopic scoring of late rectal mucosal damage was performed using Gilinsky's classification. Serum levels of VEGF were analysed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method., RESULTS: Most patients presented with Grade 1 symptoms. Endoscopic assessment showed that most patients had Grade 1 late rectal mucosal damage. The predominant endoscopic finding was the presence of telangiectasia. Assessment of VEGF correlation between the control group and the degrees of endoscopic changes showed statistically significant differences for all three degrees (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0251 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Due to the small numbers of patients with Grades 2 and 3 symptoms using the RTOG/EORTC scoring system, they were grouped with Grades 1 and 4 respectively forming two groups for statistical purposes. VEGF expression differed significantly between controls and group I and between controls and group II (P = 0.0001, P = 0.0009, respectively)., CONCLUSION: A significant increase in VEGF expression was found to correlate with clinical symptoms and endoscopic rectal mucosa changes in patients with ChRP, suggesting that it may play an important role in pathological angiogenesis.

Our target population included 55-year-old patients who present to their primary care physicians with stable chest pain., RESULTS: All diagnostic strategies yielded similar health outcomes, but performing CCTA-with or without stress testing or performing stress single-photon emission computed tomography-marginally minimized adverse events and maximized longevity and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Health outcomes associated with these strategies were comparable, with CCTA in men and women yielding the greatest QALYs but only by modest margins. Overall differences were small, and performing the most effective test-compared with the least effective-decreased adverse event rates by 3% in men and women. Comparable increases in longevity and QALYs were 2 months and 0.1 QALYs in men and 1 month and 0.03 QALYs in women. CCTA raised overall costs, partly through the follow-up of incidental findings, and when performed with stress testing, its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $26,200/QALY in men to $35,000/QALY in women. Health outcomes were marginally less favorable in women when radiation risks were considered., CONCLUSIONS: CCTA is comparable to other diagnostic studies and might hold good clinical value, but large randomized controlled trials are needed to guide policy.",Excluded

According to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer (TNM) classification, they were: 19 T1, 70 T2, 22 T3, 7 T4, 94 N0, and 24 N1-3. The treatment started with external beam irradiation (EBI) (36 Gy in 3 weeks or 45 Gy in 5 weeks). Concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C) was delivered to 31 patients. Two months later, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by interstitial 192Ir brachytherapy to 101 patients and EBI in 5. Twelve other patients had an abdominoperineal resection (APR). The mean follow-up was 6 years., RESULTS: At 5 years the overall survival was 60%, and specific survival (SS) was 75%; it was 94% for T1, 79% for T2, 53% for T3, and 19% for T4. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (> or = 4 cm), node involvement, and no response to the EBI were factors of poor prognosis for SS. Thirty-two locoregional recurrences occurred of which 21 were local recurrences in the 106 patients treated by a conservative schedule. Only tumor size and response to the EBI were prognostic factors on multivariate analysis for local and LRC. A total of 17 patients presented with LSC (Grade 3, 16 patients; and Grade 4, 1 patient), which was treated by APR in 4 patients and colostomy in 11 (of which 7 were definitive). The only significant prognostic factor for LSC in the multivariate analysis was the total extrapolated response dose of irradiation. The definitive rate of SC after conservative treatment in cured patients was 100% for T1, 82% for T2, 58% for T3, and 100% for T4. Since 1989, improvements of the technique have allowed reduction of the LSC in maintaining the same local control., CONCLUSION: The results of this series are similar to those of the literature. The confirmation of pretherapeutic prognostic factors related to response to the treatment should allow us to adapt the therapeutic intensity for each case to obtain better tumor control, with as few sequelae as possible, to yield a better rate of SC.",Excluded

Two hundred sixty patients (male, 111; female, 149; median age, 68 years) with histologically proven MMHN were enrolled., RESULTS: Primary sites included the nasal cavity in 178 patients, paranasal sinuses in 43, oral cavity in 27, and pharynx in 12. Eighty-six patients had T3 tumors, 147 had T4a tumors, and 27 had T4b tumors. Two hundred fifty-one patients were diagnosed with N0 disease, and 9 with N1 disease. The median total dose and number of fractions were 57.6 Gy RBE (relative biological effectiveness) and 16, respectively. Chemotherapy including dimethyl traizeno imidazole carboxamide was used concurrently in 129 patients. The median follow-up duration was 22 months (range, 1-132 months). The 2-year overall survival and local control rates were 69.4% and 83.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that gross tumor volume and concurrent chemotherapy were significant prognostic factors for overall survival.

We have employed partial-brain radiotherapy (PBRT) with wide margins for PCNSL patients with a single lesion or a few lesions. In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome in PCNSL patients undergoing PBRT. Between 2003 and 2014, 24 patients were treated with PBRT; 16 received high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) -containing chemotherapy before PBRT. Conventional fractionation with a median dose of 54 Gy was used. For reference, 15 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT were also analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 60% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 68% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy plus PBRT. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 41% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 36% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. The in-field recurrence rate was 26% and the out-of-field recurrence rate was 15% at 3 years for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT. The rates for in-field recurrence and the out-of-field recurrence were 27% and 21%, respectively, for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. CNS-recurrence rates were similar in patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and PBRT to the rates in those undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT. Neurocognitive dysfunction developed in 3 of the 16 patients undergoing MTX + PBRT and in 4 of 15 patients undergoing MTX + WBRT (P = 0.68). PBRT seems to be a feasible treatment option for solitary PCNSL. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the advantages of PBRT over WBRT. Copyright © The Author 2015.

2664,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) of the socket: Management of extensive tumors with interferon PURPOSE:: To describe the clinical features and management of extensive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (squamous cell carcinoma) of the socket. METHOD(S):: Retrospective interventional case series. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNa2b) eye drops (1 million units/cc) 4 times daily and IFNa2b sublesional injection (5 million units/0.5cc to 8 million units/0.8 cc) were delivered for tumor control. Participants were 3 patients with ocular prosthesis who developed extensive socket OSSN. Tumor control was graded as complete regression, partial regression, or no regression. RESULT(S):: OSSN was detected in the socket at age 60, 43, and 20 years in patients who had worn ophthalmic prostheses for 54, 26, and 13 years, respectively. The patients had chronic discharge and irritation (n = 3) managed with intermittent topical corticosteroids (n = 2). There were no predisposing factors of cigarette exposure, radiation exposure, eczema, systemic immune suppression, or organ transplantation. The prosthesis fit well with nonirritative edges. At presentation, OSSN was subtle (n = 3), vascular (n = 3), and multifocal (n = 3), with largest lesions or confluence of lesions measuring 20, 25, and 20 mm, respectively. The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN. Combined topical and injection IFNa2b could represent a potentially effective therapy for this condition. © 2011 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.",Excluded
816,"Impact of age on the selection of nuclear cardiology stress protocols: The INCAPS (IAEA nuclear cardiology protocols) study BACKGROUND: There is growing concern about radiation exposure from nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), particularly among younger patients who are more prone to develop untoward effects of ionizing radiation, and hence US and European professional society guidelines recommend age as a consideration in weighing radiation risk from MPI. We aimed to determine how patient radiation doses from MPI vary across age groups in a large contemporary international cohort. METHODS: Data were collected as part of a global cross-sectional study of centers performing MPI coordinated by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Sites provided information on each MPI study completed during a single week in March-April 2013. We compared across age groups laboratory adherence to pre-specified radiation-related best practices, radiation effective dose (ED; a whole-body measure reflecting the amount of radiation to each organ and its relative sensitivity to radiation's deleterious effects), and the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv, a target level specified in guidelines. RESULTS: Among 7911 patients undergoing MPI in 308 laboratories in 65 countries, mean ED was 10.0+/-4.5mSv with slightly higher exposure among younger age groups (trend p value<0.001). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with ED<=9mSv across age groups, or in adherence to best practices based on the median age of patients in a laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: In contemporary nuclear cardiology practice, the age of the patient appears not to impact protocol selection and radiation dose, contrary to professional society guidelines.",Excluded
2419,"Response of the rat spinal cord to X-ray microbeams BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To quantify the late dose-related responses of the rat cervical spinal cord to X-ray irradiations by an array of microbeams or by a single millimeter beam., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Necks of anesthetized rats were irradiated transversely by an 11 mm wide array of 52 parallel, 35 mum wide, vertical X-ray microbeams, separated by 210 mum intervals between centers. Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

3285,"Radionuclide therapy in cancer patients with bone metastases Aim: We submit our experience in the application of radionuclides for therapy of bone metastases of cancer patients with different foci of appearance of the cancer process: breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and others. Material(s) and Method(s): In 167 patients with bone metastases we used 32-P in 71 patients and 89-Sr in 96 patients. 93 are women and 74 are men; 90 women are with cancer of the breast, 52- with prostate cancer, 24 are with lung cancer and 1 with renal cell carcinoma. All patients are observed for side effects when an application of a radiopharmaceutical is done-32-P per os and 89-Sr intravenous, as well as for the changes of haemoglobin, leucocyte and thrombocyte count. Result(s): One months after the radionuclide therapy we observed a significant reduction of the leucocyte and thrombocyte count in the group accepted 32-P (t = 3.83, p < 0.05; t = 5.29, p < 0.001). For the group, where 89-Sr is applied we did not calculate statistically significant decrease of the tested indicators mentioned above. At the same time the basic reason for which the radionuclides are applied- pain, decreases in intensity and patients return to their normal activity.This is more typical for patients with cancer of the breast and prostate cancer. Discussion(s): The serious symptom 'pain' is influenced by the not so high applied activity of 2 mCi of 32-P speaks in favour of the use of this radiophar-maceutic, although there is a resistance among authors of its application with regard to myelosuppression. According to our observations it is light, the blood indicators restore quickly even without special therapy and patients can take the advantage of this additional method to overcome pain syndrome. The intravenous applicaton of 89-Sr in activity of 4 mCi also influences pain in a very good way, but the price per patient is high and all patients wait for an reimbursement from the health insurance. This is a significant factor for wider use. The use of 32-P is cheaper but the delivery stopped and for the moment we can use only 89-Sr. Conclusion(s): The application of 32-P and 89-Sr is additional possibility for the treatment of pain due to bone metastases of cancer patients- easy and effective especially for those that are not treated effectively after local irradiation. The myelosuppressive effect is not statistically significant and both isotopes can be used successfully in the treatment of pain in cancer patients.",Excluded
2094,"Imaging for appendicitis: should radiation-induced cancer risks affect modality selection? PURPOSE: To compare life expectancy (LE) losses attributable to three imaging strategies for appendicitis in adults-computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography (US) followed by CT for negative or indeterminate US results, and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-by using a decision-analytic model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this model, for each imaging strategy, LE losses for 20-, 40-, and 65-year-old men and women were computed as a function of five key variables: baseline cohort LE, test performance, surgical mortality, risk of death from delayed diagnosis (missed appendicitis), and LE loss attributable to radiation-induced cancer death. Appendicitis prevalence, test performance, mortality rates from surgery and missed appendicitis, and radiation doses from CT were elicited from the published literature and institutional data. LE loss attributable to radiation exposure was projected by using a separate organ-specific model that accounted for anatomic coverage during a typical abdominopelvic CT examination. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate effects of model input variability on results., RESULTS: Outcomes across imaging strategies differed minimally-for example, for 20-year-old men, corresponding LE losses were 5.8 days (MR imaging), 6.8 days (combined US and CT), and 8.2 days (CT). This order was sensitive to differences in test performance but was insensitive to variation in radiation-induced cancer deaths. For example, in the same cohort, MR imaging sensitivity had to be 91% at minimum (if specificity were 100%), and MR imaging specificity had to be 62% at minimum (if sensitivity were 100%) to incur the least LE loss. Conversely, LE loss attributable to radiation exposure would need to decrease by 74-fold for combined US and CT, instead of MR imaging, to incur the least LE loss., CONCLUSION: The specific imaging strategy used to diagnose appendicitis minimally affects outcomes. Paradigm shifts to MR imaging owing to concerns over radiation should be considered only if MR imaging test performance is very high.",Excluded
2268,"Assessing rheumatologists' attitudes and utilization of classification criteria for ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis: a global effort Objectives: This study aims to assess rheumatologists' perceptions, utilization patterns, and attitudes towards the modified New York (mNY) criteria for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). Method(s): Members of the national rheumatology societies in five countries (United States of America (USA), Canada, India, Turkey, and Brazil) were invited to participate in a survey containing questions regarding rheumatologists' familiarity, and use of AS and axSpA classification criteria in daily practice, perceived specificity of spondyloarthritis features in making the diagnosis, patterns of imaging tests performed in daily practice, and their opinion about the need for modification of current classification criteria. The responses were analyzed by gender, age, years in practice, as well as by country of practice. Descriptive statistics, t test, and chi-square test were used for comparison of groups. Result(s): Approximately 6% rheumatologists (478 out of 8021 professional association members) from five countries completed the survey. The country-specific response rates were Brazil 4%, USA 4.3%, India 11%, Canada 14%, and Turkey 29%, though the overall contributions from individual countries were USA 47%, India 14.9%, Brazil 13.8%, Turkey 12.8%, and Canada 8.8%. The mean age of respondents was 50 years (+/- 11.8), 31% were females and 90% spent majority (> 75%) of their time in clinical practice. The mNY and ASAS criteria were regularly used in clinical practice by 44 and 66% of responders, respectively. Those reporting ""always"" using ASAS criteria were more likely to be women (p = 0.006), and within 5 years of completing rheumatology training. Vast majority (74%) regarded Inflammatory Back Pain (IBP) as a specific feature for axSpA. Majority (50 and 60%, respectively) regarded uveitis and dactylitis as ""very specific"" features helping them make the diagnosis of axSpA, whereas heel enthesitis, peripheral inflammatory arthritis, and response to NSAIDs were considered ""somewhat specific"" by 50% of the responders. Less than half (47%) of the responders used the mNY grading for X-ray of SI joints. In the case of normal X-ray of SI joint, the use of MRI was more frequent than CT scan (83.6 vs. 10.9%) in assessing for sacroiliitis. If sacroiliitis was not seen on X-rays, the likelihood of ordering MRI was significantly higher among rheumatologists completing training within < 15 years versus > 25 years prior (90 vs. 75%, p = 0.007). Overall, 70% thought that ASAS criteria were adequately specific for clinical trials. However, 42% respondents still felt a need to modify ASAS classification criteria for axSpA. Also, 46% respondents felt that mNY criteria should be modified. Conclusion(s): In the absence of diagnostic criteria, majority of rheumatologists are using the classification criteria for diagnosis of axSpA. Though axSpA classification criteria are perceived to be specific for clinical trials, 40% rheumatologists feel the need to modify these criteria.Key Points* This study informs how rheumatologists in five countries spread over four different continents diagnose axSpA in clinical practice.* Since majority rheumatologists among survey respondents across the countries use ASAS criteria for diagnosis of axSpA, more specific criteria may be required to avoid overdiagnosis.* MRI is commonly used to rule out sacroiliitis in case of normal X-ray of sacroiliac joints.Copyright © 2020, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).",Excluded
960,"Dietary carotenoids contribute to normal human skin color and UV photosensitivity The aim of the current study was to determine whether dietary carotenoids influence skin pigmentation and UV photosensitivity in a healthy unsupplemented panel (n = 22) of Caucasian (skin Type II) subjects. Skin spectrophotometric and tristimulus (L*a*b*) CR200 chromameter readings were made at various body sites to objectively measure skin carotenoid levels and skin color, respectively. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) was also measured to determine the intrinsic UV photosensitivity of the skin. We found that tristimulus b* values (but not L* and a* values) were consistently and closely correlated with skin carotenoid levels at a number of body sites including the back (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), forehead (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), inner forearm (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) and palm of the hand (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Skin carotenoid levels and MED were also correlated in these subjects (r = 0.66, P < 0.001), as were tristimulus b* values and MED (r = 0.71, P < 0.0002). From these observations, we conclude that carotenoids from a normal, unsupplemented diet accumulate in the skin and confer a measurable photoprotective benefit (at least in lightly pigmented Caucasian skin), that is directly linked to their concentration in the tissue. Carotenoids also appear to contribute measurably and significantly to normal human skin color, in particular the appearance of yellowness"" as defined objectively by CR200 tristimulus b* values. On the basis of these findings we believe that objective measurements of skin color, in particular tristimulus b* values, may be a potentially useful means of monitoring dietary carotenoid status and assessing UV photosensitivity in Caucasian populations.""",Excluded

In the advanced fibrosis stages, the sensitivity of ARFI was 70% and specificity was 80%, with positive and negative predictive values of 53.8 and 88.9%, respectively. The accuracy of detection of advanced fibrosis by ARFI was 77.5%., CONCLUSION: ARFI imaging is a promising noninvasive US-based method for the assessment of liver fibrosis.",Excluded
39,"A comparison of normal tissue complication probability of brain for proton and photon therapy of canine nasal tumors This study compared the calculated normal tissue complication probability of brain in dogs with a nasal tumor, which had both photon and proton treatment planning. Nine dogs diagnosed with a variety of histologies, but all with large, caudally located nasal tumors were studied. Three-dimensional (3-D) photon dose distribution, and a proton dose distribution was calculated for each dog. To calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for brain, the partial brain volume irradiated with the prescribed dose was determined, then a mathematic model relating complications to partial volume and radiation dose was used. The NTCP was always smaller for proton plans as compared to photon plans, indicating conformation of the dose to the target allows a higher dose to be given. If a 5% NTCP were accepted, the mean applicable dose for this group of dogs was 50.2 Gy for photons, but 58.3 Gy for protons. Not all dogs would benefit the same from proton irradiation. If a large partial brain volume has to be irradiated, the advantage becomes minimal. There is also a minimal advantage if the planning target volume (PTV) includes a small, superficial brain volume. However, for a complex PTV shape the degree of conformation is clearly superior for protons and results in smaller calculated NTCPs.",Excluded
2766,"Reciprocal translocations as an indicator for radiation exposures in the low dose range A few years back, the frequency of dicentrics was determined shortly after exposure in five accidentally exposed radiation workers. In all cases the observed dicentric yield was significantly higher in comparison with the background level, and the resulting estimated whole body doses lay between 0.2 and 0.3 Gy. Now, a number of years later (1 to 11 years), the frequency of translocations has been determined by means of the FISH technique. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were painted. The measured translocation frequency lay, however, within the range of the spontaneous variation between individuals. No radiation exposure could, therefore, be proven. In two further cases, the dicentrics were determined by means of the conventional Giemsa staining technique, and the translocations by means of chromosome painting carried out on the same blood samples, which were taken about 3 and 10 years, respectively, after the radiation exposure. The dose estimates obtained on the basis of dicentric frequency using the Qdr method, and on the basis of FISH detected translocations, are compared.

The purpose of the paper is to define predictors of the kerma-area product (KAP) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Two new digital X-ray interventional cardiology systems recently installed were included. A total of 398 PCI procedures were carried out by 6 board-certified senior interventional cardiologists with more than 15 years' experience and good knowledge of radiation protection measures. Clinical, radiation and procedural data were collected based on a detailed protocol developed by the SENTINEL cardiology subgroup. Correlation with clinical and procedure factors was then investigated. A significant correlation was found between fluoroscopy time and (i) lesion classification, (ii) the level of tortuosity and (iii) the number of vessels treated. No statistically significant differences were observed in the complexity of the case between operators. However, large differences were found in the KAP among operators, which were mostly attributed to the different number of frames taken by each operator. There was no statistically significant correlation between complexity and the total number of frames. The study showed that, in certain circumstances, the clinical need to successfully perform PCI takes precedence over radiation safety concerns.",Excluded
1872,"Sleep Disturbance and Pain Severity and Multi-site Pain: A Prospective 10.7-year Follow-up Study Background/Purpose: Sleep disturbance is often comorbid with chronic pain disorders, with emerging evidence suggesting a stronger effect of sleep disturbance on pain than vice versa; however, few studies have evaluated the long-term effect of sleep disturbance on pain. This study sought to examine the association of sleep disturbance with knee pain severity and number of painful sites (NPS) and investigate whether persistent sleep disturbance increases the risk of persistent pain. Method(s): 1,099 community-dwelling older adults (age: mean+/-SD, 63+/-7.5 years; 51% female) were recruited and followed-up at 2.6, 5.1 and 10.7-year later. Data on demographics, body mass index, physical activity, comorbidities were collected. At each time-point, sleep disturbance, knee pain severity and NPS were assessed by using questionnaires. Radiographic knee osteoarthritis (ROA) was measured using x-ray. Multi-site pain (MSP) was defined as NPS >=2. Persistent pain was defined as having knee pain or MSP at all time-points. Multivariable mixed-effects models and log-binomial regression were applied for the analyses. Result(s): Sleep disturbance was associated with greater knee pain severity (beta 0.91, 95%CI 0.70-1.11) and higher risk of having more NPS [(Relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95%CI 1.07-1.14] in a dose-response manner in multivariable analyse with adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, physical activity, comorbidities, pain medications, ever smoking, emotional problems, employment, and education level. Persistent sleep disturbance was associated with a greater risk of persistent knee pain (RR 1.90, 1.26-2.87) and MSP (RR 1.29, 1.07-1.56). In participants with ROA, results were similar apart from the link between sleep disturbance and persistent pain. pain. Conclusion(s): Sleep disturbance was independently associated with greater pain severity and significantly increases risk for MSP with a long-term effect of sleep on pain in general and ROA population, suggesting beneficial effects of treating sleep problems on long-term pain control.",Excluded
3126,"Gut microbial dysbiosis is associated with development and progression of radiation enteritis during pelvic radiotherapy Radiation enteritis (RE) is the most common complication of radiotherapy for pelvic irradiation receivers. Herein we investigated the alterations in gut microbial profiles and their association with enteritis in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. Faecal samples were collected from 18 cervical cancer patients during radiotherapy. Microbiota profiles were characterized based on 16S rRNA sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Epithelial inflammatory response was evaluated using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures. Dysbiosis was observed among patients with RE, which was characterized by significantly reduced alpha-diversity but increased beta-diversity, relative higher abundance of Proteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria and lower abundance of Bacteroides. Coprococcus was clearly enriched prior to radiotherapy in patients who later developed RE. Metastat analysis further revealed unique grade-related microbial features, such as more abundant Virgibacillus and Alcanivorax in patients with mild enteritis. Additionally, using bacterial-epithelial co-cultures, RE patient-derived microbiota induced epithelial inflammation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced TNF-alpha and IL-1beta expression compared with control microbiota. Taken together, we define the overall picture of gut microbiota in patients with RE. Our results suggest that dysbiosis of gut microbiota may contribute to development and progression of RE. Gut microbiota can offer a set of biomarkers for prediction, disease activity evaluation and treatment selection in RE. Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

96,"Analysis of DNA repair gene polymorphisms in glioblastoma BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

1998,"Late Effects of Head and Neck Radiotherapy on Pulp Vitality Assessed by Pulse Oximetry INTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy (RT) of malignant tumors in the head and neck area may have damaging effects on surrounding tissues. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term effects of ionizing radiation on pulp vitality by measuring pulp oxygenation levels (%SpO2) in patients with history of RT of intraoral and oropharyngeal tumors 4-6 years after treatment., METHODS: In an experimental group RT (n = 90, history of RT) and a control group CON (n = 90, no history of RT), pulp vitality was assessed by measuring %SpO2 by using pulse oximetry and pulp sensitivity by cold thermal testing. All anterior teeth without history of endodontic therapy of the participants in group RT were measured (n = 693), regardless of the quadrant and the irradiated area. An equal number of anterior teeth were tested in group CON., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the %SpO2 levels in group RT (92.7%; standard deviation, +/- 1.83) and group CON (92.6%; standard deviation, +/- 1.80). All teeth in RT and CON groups showed a positive response to the thermal test. All tested teeth were considered vital., CONCLUSIONS: Pulp %SpO2 was found to be within normal limits 4-6 years after RT. This suggests that RT may not have a long-term influence on pulp vitality, and reported short-term changes in pulpal microcirculation because of RT may be temporary.

840,"Concomitant radiochemotherapy for locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer: tolerance and early results Combination of radio- and chemotherapy is one of the methods which may improve results of treatment in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Currently, the most promising sequence of radio- and chemotherapy is concomitant. In Head and Neck Cancer Department of Cancer Center in Warsaw since 1995 is continued study estimated tolerance and effectiveness of the concomitant radiochemotherapy for patients with locally advanced oro- and hypopharyngeal cancer. Chemotherapy consist of cisplatinum and 5-fluorouracil in continuous infusion during first week of irradiation followed by 24-hours infusion of 5-fluorouracil one weekly until radiotherapy is finished. Radiotherapy is used with conventional fractionation 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions weekly to total dose 66 Gy. Between October 1995 and September 1998 fifty seven patients with oropharyngeal cancer were entered to study. Tolerance of treatment was acceptable. Complete regression of the tumor was obtained in 41/57 patients (72%). Five other patients after radiotherapy were referred for successful radical neck dissection. Including this group, local control was obtained in 81%. At this moment, 60% of patients are alive without evidence of disease. In 12 patients with hypopharyngeal cancer tolerance of treatment and early results were poor, so the study was stopped in this group.",Excluded
3159,"Corazonin- and PDF-immunoreactivities in the cephalic ganglia of termites Antisera against the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) and corazonin (Crz) reacted with distinct sets of neurons in the cephalic ganglia of termites. The locations of immunoreactive cells were similar but their numbers differed among the eight species examined: PDF-ir occurred in 0-6 cells in each optic lobe and 1-2 pairs of cells in the subosophageal ganglion (SOG), and Crz-ir in 0-2 pairs of cells in the pars intecerebralis, 3-14 cells in each lateral protocerebrum, and 0-6 pairs of cells in the SOG. Staining patterns were identical in the pseudergates, soldiers, and substitutive reproductives of Prorhinotermes simplex. Workers and soldiers were compared in the remaining 7 species. The only caste divergence was detected in Coptotermes formosanus, in which the soldiers differed from the workers by lack of 4 Crz-ir perikarya in the pars intercerebralis and occasionally also by the absence of 2 Crz-ir perikarya in the SOG. Diurnal changes in PDF-ir and Crz-ir were examined in P. simplex kept under long day (18:6 h light:darkness) or short day (10:14 h) photoperiods.

3030,"Effects of gamma irradiation on mechanical properties of defatted trabecular bone allografts assessed by speed-of-sound measurement New sterilization methods for human bone allografts may lead to alterations in bone mechanical properties, which strongly influence short- and medium-term outcomes. In many sterilization procedures, bone allografts are subjected to gamma irradiation, usually with 25 KGy, after treatment and packaging. We used speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on bone. All bone specimens were subjected to the same microbial inactivation procedure. They were then separated into three groups, of which one was treated and not irradiated and two were exposed to 10 and 25 KGy of gamma radiation, respectively. SOS was measured using high- and low-frequency ultrasound beams in each orthogonal direction. SOS and Young modulus were altered significantly in the three groups, compared to native untreated bone. Exposure to 10 or 25 KGy had no noticeable effect on the study variables. The impact of irradiation was small compared to the effects of physical or chemical defatting. Reducing the radiation dose used in everyday practice failed to improve graft mechanical properties in this study. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",Included

All patients underwent colonoscopy. Smoking, alcohol drinking, drug exposure, and the Charlson comorbidity index score were assessed before colonoscopy. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of LGIB were estimated., RESULTS: LGIB was significantly associated with older age, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin use. PPI use was significantly associated with older age, male sex, being a current alcohol drinker, higher comorbidity index, and NSAID, aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, acetaminophen, or corticosteroid use. Multivariate analysis adjusted by the confounding factors revealed LGIB was not significantly associated with PPI use (AOR 0.87; 95 % confidence interval 0.68-1.13; p = 0.311), or specifically with omeprazole (AOR 1.18; p = 0.408), esomeprazole (AOR 0.76; p = 0.432), lansoprazole (AOR 0.93; p = 0.669), or rabeprazole (AOR 0.63; p = 0.140).

172,"Postoperative irradiation for pterygium: retrospective analysis of 1,253 patients from the Osaka University Hospital BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Irradiation of ocular pterygium is considered a valuable treatment supplementation after surgical therapy. Since prospective randomized trials are scare and only limited patient data are available, the aim of this study was to evaluate the patient population treated with fractioned 90Sr irradiation after surgical pterygium resection., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between September 1993 and March 2001, 1,147 patients with pterygium lesions (1,320 lesions) were treated surgically and with 90Sr postoperative beta-irradiation. A total dose of 30 Gy was used for patients treated within 48 h after surgery, while those treated>48 h postoperatively received a total dose of 35 Gy. A minimum follow-up period of 3 months was required for inclusion in the analysis, and 1,253 lesions were ultimately analyzed., RESULTS: Recurrence of the pterygium after postoperative 90Sr irradiation was observed in 97 of 1,253 cases (7.7%). Statistical analysis (uni- and multivariate) revealed, that male gender, younger age (<40 years), prior treatment (surgery and radiotherapy) and immediate irradiation (<2 h after surgery) were negative predictors for local recurrence. Temporary radiotherapy-induced side effects were observed in 15.2% of patients, including moderate conjunctivitis, local pain, visual disturbance and photophobia or an increase in tear flow. However, no long-term serious side effects were documented., CONCLUSION: 90Sr irradiation of pterygium after surgery represents a safe and effective treatment option to prevent disease recurrence. The data obtained in this study indicate that a certain interval after surgery might improve therapy outcome.",Included
3318,"Acute massive gastrointestinal bleeding: Detection and localization with arterial phase multi-detector row helical CT Purpose: To prospectively evaluate accuracy of arterial phase multi-detector row helical computed tomography (CT) for detection and localization of acute massive gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, with angiography as reference standard. Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional review board approved this study; written informed consent was obtained from each patient or patient's family after procedures, including radiation dose, were explained. Twenty-six consecutive patients (17 men, nine women; age range, 18-89 years) had acute massive GI bleeding (defined as requirement of transfusion of at least 4 units of blood during 24 hours in the hospital or as hypotension with systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and underwent arterial phase multi-detector row CT before angiography. Scans were obtained during arterial phase to identify extravasation of contrast material with attenuation greater than 90 HU within bowel lumen; this finding was considered diagnostic for active GI bleeding. Presence of contrast medium extravasation in each anatomic location was recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding were assessed. Accuracy for localization of acute GI bleeding was assessed by comparing locations of active bleeding at both multi-detector row CT and angiography in each patient who had active bleeding. Result(s): Arterial phase multi-detector row CT deplicted extravasation of contrast material in 21 of 26 patients. Overall location-based sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and positive and negative predictive values of multi-detector row CT for detection of GI bleeding were 90.9% (20 of 22), 99% (107 of 109), respectively. Overall patient-based accuracy of multi-detector row CT for detection of acute GI bleeding was 88.5% (23 of 26). The location of contrast material extravasation on multi-detector row CT scans corresponded exactly to that of active bleeding on angiograms in all patients with contrast medium extravasation at both multi-detector row CT and angiography. Conclusion(s): Arterial phase multi-detector row CT is accurate for detection and localization of bleeding sites in patients with acute massive GI bleeding. © RSNA, 2006.",Excluded
1197,"Potential for radiation dose savings in abdominal and chest CT using automatic tube voltage selection in combination with automatic tube current modulation OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous use of automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) and automatic tube voltage selection (ATVS) for abdominal and chest CT examinations regarding radiation dose reduction and image quality., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 617 patients who all underwent contrast-enhanced chest or abdominal CT and divided them into two groups. In group A, 317 patients who underwent CT with only ATCM and a fixed body mass index-adjusted tube voltage (120 kV or 100 kV) were enrolled. In group B, both ATCM and ATVS were used. Image attenuation and noise were measured in different anatomic regions., RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio and the signal-to-noise ratio of abdomen and chest CT was higher in group B compared with group A (p < 0.0001). In total, the effective radiation doses for abdomen and chest CT examinations were significantly reduced in group B by 18% compared with group A (p < 0.0001). When only examining those who benefited from the ATVS tool, a dose reduction of 35% for chest CT and 42% for abdomen CT could be achieved (p < 0.0001 for each)., CONCLUSION: The simultaneous use of ATVS and ATCM enables significant radiation dose reduction in abdominal and thoracic contrast-enhanced CT examinations compared with the use of ATCM alone.",Excluded

We report the use of CBCT angiography using CBCT in 10 patients with 8 liver malignancies and 2 hypersplenisms during abdominal interventional procedures. CBCT was very useful for interventional radiologists to confirm a perfusion area of the artery catheter wedged on CT by injection of contrast media through the catheter tip, although the image quality was slightly degraded, scoring as 2.60 on average by streak artifacts.

1944,"Mouse spleen lymphocyte bactericidal and peroxidase activities: enhancement by whole body x-irradiation A 20,000 g pellet obtained from the homogenate of CD1 mouse spleen cells has measurable peroxidase and bactericidal activities. Whole body x-irradiation stimulates the in vitro peroxidative and bactericidal activities of the spleen cells. These cells do not phagocytize. However, addition of polystyrene latex particles to spleen cells from non- or x-irradiated mice, increases glucose oxidation. The extent of this stimulation (three- to fourfold) is less than that of PMN (six- to tenfold). Interaction between particles and lymphocyte surface may be the cause of this stimulation. The increased bactericidal activity due to x-ray is attributed mainly to an increase in the peroxidase activity of the lymphocytes. Surface (membrane) action rather than phagocytosis may be involved in the bactericidal process. The spleen lymphocyte peroxidase is distinct from myeloperoxidase in several respects.",Included
510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies. Watchful monitoring, corrections to calculated dose when changes observed are significant and radiotherapy accessories modification during the course of treatment are strongly recommended.",Excluded

This paper aims to fill this gap with reference to the recovery process in Fukushima City following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami in Japan., METHODS: Open access data were sourced from the 2015 Social Survey on Living and Disaster Recovery (SSLDR) (N = 1439) of Fukushima citizens. Pearson's Chi-square Test and the t-test were employed to examine gender differences with regard to happiness and exploratory variables. Following this, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the determinants of happiness., RESULTS: The results showed that, compared to females, male respondents were unhappier and reported more property loss and less neighborhood connectedness. Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded
345,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded

Method(s): From March 2009 to July 2011, 10 patients with 12 unresectable primary (n = 6) or recurrent (n = 6) cholangiocarcinoma lesions underwent abdominal SBRT. Sites treated included liver (n = 10), abdominal lymph nodes (n = 1), and adrenal gland (n = 1). SBRT was delivered in three (n = 2) or five (n = 10) consecutive daily fractions over one week. The median prescription dose was 55 Gy (range, 45-60). Treatment response was graded by RECIST v.1.1, and toxicities were scored by CTCAE v.4.0. Data was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method to determine rates of local control (LC), freedom from distant progression (FFDM) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): The median follow-up was 14 months (range, 2-26 months). LC, defined as freedom from progression within the SBRT field, was 100%, but four patients treated to intrahepatic sites experienced progression elsewhere in the liver. Estimates for FFDM at 6 and 12 months were 73% and 31%, respectively. Sites of disease relapse included liver (n = 3), liver and lymph nodes (n = 1), liver and lungs (n = 1), lymph nodes (n = 1), and mesentery (n = 1). OS estimates for the cohort at 6 and 12 months were 83% and 73%, respectively. The most common Grade >=2 early toxicities were Grade 2 nausea and vomiting (n = 5) and gastrointestinal pain (n = 2). Late >=2 toxicities included Grade 2 gastrointestinal pain (n = 3), Grade 3 biliary stenosis (n = 1), and Grade 5 liver failure (n = 1).

3057,"Commercial sunscreen formulations: UVB irradiation stability and effect on UVB irradiation-induced skin oxidative stress and inflammation Evidence shows that sunscreens undergo degradation processes induced by UV irradiation forming free radicals, which reduces skin protection. In this regard, the biological effects of three commercial sunscreen formulations upon UVB irradiation in the skin were investigated. The three formulations had in common the presence of benzophenone-3 added with octyl methoxycinnamate or octyl salycilate or both, which are regular UV filters in sunscreens. The results show that formulations F1 and F2 presented partial degradation upon UVB irradiation. Formulations F1 and F2 presented higher skin penetration profiles than F3. None of the formulations avoided UVB irradiation-induced GSH depletion, but inhibited reduction of SOD activity, suggesting the tested formulations did not present as a major mechanism inhibiting all UVB irradiation-triggered oxidative stress pathways. The formulations avoided the increase of myeloperoxidase activity and cytokine production (IL-1beta and TNF-alpha), but with different levels of protection in relation to the IL-1beta release. Concluding, UVB irradiation can reduce the stability of sunscreens, which in turn, present the undesirable properties of reaching viable skin. Additionally, the same SPF does not mean that different sunscreens will present the same biological effects as SPF is solely based on a skin erythema response. This found opens up perspectives to consider additional studies to reach highly safe sunscreens. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

456,"Effective surgical adjuvant therapy for high-risk rectal carcinoma BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy as an adjunct to surgery for rectal cancer has been shown to reduce local recurrence but has not improved survival. In a previous study, combined radiation and chemotherapy improved survival significantly as compared with surgery alone, but not as compared with adjuvant radiation, which many regard as standard therapy. We designed a combination regimen to optimize the contribution of chemotherapy, decrease recurrence, and improve survival as compared with adjuvant radiation alone., METHODS: Two hundred four patients with rectal carcinoma that was either deeply invasive or metastatic to regional lymph nodes were randomly assigned to postoperative radiation alone (4500 to 5040 cGy) or to radiation plus fluorouracil, which was both preceded and followed by a cycle of systemic therapy with fluorouracil plus semustine (methyl-CCNU)., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of more than seven years, the combined therapy had reduced the recurrence of rectal cancer by 34 percent (P = 0.0016; 95 percent confidence interval, 12 to 50 percent). Initial local recurrence was reduced by 46 percent (P = 0.036; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 70 percent), and distant metastasis by 37 percent (P = 0.011; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 57 percent). In addition, combined therapy reduced the rate of cancer-related deaths by 36 percent (P = 0.0071; 95 percent confidence interval, 14 to 53 percent) and the overall death rate by 29 percent (P = 0.025; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 45 percent). Its acute toxic effects included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. These effects were seldom severe. Severe, delayed treatment-related reactions, usually small-bowel obstruction requiring surgery, occurred in 6.7 percent of all patients receiving radiation, and the frequencies of these complications were comparable in both treatment groups., CONCLUSIONS: The combination of postoperative local therapy with radiation plus fluorouracil and systemic therapy with a fluorouracil-based regimen significantly and substantively improves the results of therapy for rectal carcinoma with a poor prognosis, as compared with postoperative radiation alone.",Excluded
228,"Adaptation to motion sickness from torso rotation affects symptoms from supine head nodding INTRODUCTION: Space motion sickness affects more than 50% of astronauts. Adaptation to one kind of nauseogenic motion can affect the response to another. We hypothesized that repeated exposure to torso rotation (TR) would diminish motion sickness (MS) due to supine head nodding (HN), a ground-based analogue for space sickness., METHODS: During TR, standing subjects swept their gaze back and forth between two targets located 135 degrees to either side of straight ahead. For HN, the subject lay supine on a platform with his/her head and neck hanging over the edge. The head was pitched back and forth between the horizontal position and rotated back as far as possible. MS was quantified in 5 male and 20 female subjects using numerical estimates of discomfort and a more detailed questionnaire. Susceptibility to TR and HN was determined on three occasions for each stimulus. At least 1 mo separated any two tests. Subjects were exposed to TR once a day for 7 consecutive days 1 mo after the final control session. Within 24 h of the seventh session, and 1 mo later, susceptibility to HN was evaluated again., RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in MS susceptibility during repeated exposure to TR (time to stop 17.7 min on Day 1, 31.8 min on Day 7). In contrast, there was a significant increase in MS susceptibility to HN after repeated exposure to TR (mean time to stop 11.7 min before TR, 9.5 min after). Susceptibility to HN was back to normal (time to stop 11.4 min) 1 mo later., DISCUSSION: Subjects can adapt to TR by repeated exposure. At the same time, susceptibility to HN increases. Strategies for pre-adaptation to space motion sickness need to be chosen carefully as they could actually be counterproductive.",Excluded

Method(s): Forty-eight patients (11 SCLC, 37 non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) receiving reRT to the thorax were identified; 44 (92%) received reRT by intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Palliative responses, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Result(s): NSCLC patients received a median of 30 Gy in a median of 10 fractions, whereas SCLC patients received a median of 37.5 Gy in a median of 15 fractions. Median survival for the entire cohort from reRT was 4.2 months. Median survival for NSCLC patients was 5.1 months, versus 3.1 months for the SCLC patients (P=0.15). In NSCLC patients, multivariate analysis demonstrated that Karnofsky performance status>=80 and higher radiation dose were associated with improved survival following reRT, and 75% of patients with symptoms experienced palliative benefit. In SCLC, 4 patients treated with the intent of life prolongation for radiographic recurrence had a median survival of 11.7 months. However, acute toxicities and new disease symptoms limited the duration of palliative benefit in the 7 symptomatic SCLC patients to 0.5 months. Conclusion(s): ReRT to the thorax for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC can provide palliative benefit, and a small subset of patients may experience long-term survival. Select SCLC patients may experience meaningful survival prolongation after reRT, but reRT for patients with symptomatic recurrence and/or extrathoracic disease did not offer meaningful survival or durable symptom benefit.

We also wanted to determine whether technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) methylene diphosphonate (MDP) concentrations predict radiation doses of (186)Re etidronate in painful lesions., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-eight patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Patients received therapeutic doses of (186)Re etidronate. The area under the pain over time curve (AUPC) was measured for 8 weeks after treatment. Response was calculated as the percentage of change in AUPC. Quantitative bone SPECT (QBS)-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate was used for calculating radiation doses. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis determined the radiation dose threshold that best separated responders from nonresponders. SPECT-measured concentration of (186)Re etidronate in the urinary bladder was correlated with its concentration in the voided urine. Concentration of (99m)Tc MDP was compared with radiation doses to painful metastases., RESULTS: The radiation dose threshold was 2.10 Gy. For a decrease of 50% in the AUPC, the positive predictive value (PPV) of this value was 75% and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 88%. For a decrease in pain of 33%, the PPV was 84% and the NPV was 81%. In prostate cancer patients only, the PPV was 81% and the NPV was 92%.

177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly.

649,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells Background: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. Result(s): Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. Conclusion(s): Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients. © 2007 Wergeland et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Included

The characteristics of the postural corrective responses changed significantly on the day 3 following spaceflight: the amplitude of posterior sway caused by perturbation of threshold intensity was increased reaching 135% ofpreflight value; the corrective responses lasted more than 6 s in 50% of all trials, while it did not last more than 4 s in 96% before spaceflight. The EMG responses were characterized by increased contribution of medium- and long-latency reactions. On the day 11 following spaceflight, most of the characteristics of postural corrective responses were close to preflight values. We assumed that the balance alterations after spaceflight are caused by changes in weightlessness of functions of two main gravity sensory systems, namely, weight-bearing and vestibular one. The deficit of weight-bearing afferentation triggers a decline of the extensors' muscle tone, while changes of vestibular function cause a decline of accuracy of postural corrections.",Excluded
1716,"A comparison of direct versus conventional stenting in patients undergoing primary angioplasty for ST-elevation myocardial infarction OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to determine the impact of direct stenting (DS) on procedural success and the in-hospital outcome among patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., BACKGROUND: With improvements in stent designs, DS has become more widespread. The theoretical advantages of DS include a shorter procedural time, a lower contrast dose, and reduced spiral dissections, along with reduced radiation exposure and procedural costs., METHODS: A total of 1992 consecutive STEMI patients were reviewed; 621 patients (31.2%) were included in the DS group and 1371 (68.8%) in the conventional stenting (CS) group. The clinical and angiographic characteristics, in-hospital outcomes, and predictors of unsuccessful primary angioplasty were analyzed., RESULTS: The incidence of in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was 6.1% in the CS group and 4.3% in the DS group. The difference between the two patient groups was not statistically significant for myocardial reinfarction (re-MI), target-vessel revascularization, and MACE. Nonetheless, the rates of in-hospital mortality and advanced heart failure were significantly lower in the DS group.

792,"Radiosurgery for lung metastases secondary to renal cell carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiosurgery (HFSR) is a noninvasive focused beam technique that delivers high-dose radiation. Reviewed were 77 treated kidney cancers metastases in the lungs of 44 patients in this prospective study. Materials/Methods: Seventy-seven renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lung metastases in 44 patients underwent HFSR. All the patients were evaluated prospectively before and after treatment. Age at treatment ranged from 42 to 85 years (mean 65.9) with 11 females and 33 males. Fifty-five percent of patients had prior chemotherapy, 86% had prior surgery to the primary site, and 9% had prior surgery to the lung. Tumor volumes ranged from 0.06 to 3166 cc (mean 119.5). Patients were treated with 400-900 cGy per fraction (median 800) in 3-8 fractions (median 5) for a total dose of 2000-4500 cGy (median 4000). Cancers were radiographically evaluated with contrast CT and/or MRI studies and reviewed independently by radiologists. Control of the treated cancer is defined as cessation of growth, shrinkage, or disappearance of the cancer after treatment. Result(s): Follow up ranged from 1 to 59 months (mean 12) with an overall control rate of 97%. Two of the 77 lung metastases did not respond to radiosurgery. By dose, volume, age, sex, and prior treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome. Conclusion(s): Radiosurgery for metastatic RCC to the lung offers a generally well-tolerated, noninvasive treatment method with a high rate of tumor control. Patients will continue to be evaluated for longer follow-up, possible benefits of metastatic cancer treatment and survival advantage. HFSR remains an option for those whom standard approaches have not produced desired results or in patients seeking an alternative to surgical or chemotherapeutic treatment.",Excluded
1008,"Allograft alone versus allograft with bone marrow concentrate for the healing of the instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion Background context Spondylodesis in the operative management of lumbar spine diseases has been the subject of numerous studies over several decades. The posterolateral fusion (PLF) with pedicle screw fixation is a commonly used procedure. Purpose To determine whether the addition of bone marrow concentrate (BMC) to allograft bone increases fusion rate after instrumented posterior lumbar fusion. Study design The study was prospective, randomized, controlled, and blinded. Methods Eighty patients with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine underwent instrumented lumbar or lumbosacral PLF (22 men, 58 women; body mass index less than 35 for a good visualization of the PLF in the X-rays). In 40 cases, the PLF was done with spongious allograft chips alone (Group I, age 62.7 years in average, range 47-77 years, level of fusion 1-2). In another 40 cases, spongious allograft chips were mixed with BMC (Group II, age 58.5 years in average, range 42-80, level of fusion 1-3), including the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Patients were scheduled for anteroposterior and lateral radiographs 12 and 24 months after the surgery and for computed tomography scanning 24 months after the surgery. Fusion status and the degree of mineralization of the fusion mass were evaluated separately by two radiologists blinded to patient group affiliation. The bony mass was judged as fused if there was uninterrupted bridging of well-mineralized bone between the transverse processes or sacrum, with trabeculation indicating bone maturation on least at one side of the spines. Results In Group I at 12 months, the bone graft mass was assessed in X-rays as fused in no cases (0%) and at 24 months in four cases (10%). In Group II, 6 cases (15%) achieved fusion at 12 months and 14 cases (35%) at 24 months. The statistically significant difference between both groups was proven for complete fusion at both 12 (p=.041) and 24 months (p=.011). Computed tomography scans showed that 16 cases (40%) in Group I and 32 cases (80%) in Group II had evidence of at least unilateral continuous bridging bone between neighboring vertebrae at 24 months (p<.05). Conclusions We have confirmed the hypothesis that the autologous BMC together with the allograft is a better alternative for PLF than the allograft alone. The use of autologous MSCs in form of BMC in combination with allograft is an effective option to enhance the PLF healing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
855,"Physicochemical properties of calcific deposits isolated from porcine bioprosthetic heart valves removed from patients following 2-13 years function The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties of calcific deposits that cause the failure of tissue-derived heart valve bioprostheses. This was done in an effort to understand the mechanism of pathologic biomineralization in the cardiovascular system and potentially prevent deterioration of bioprostheses. Calcific deposits taken from 10 failed bioprosthetic valves that had been implanted in patients for 2-13 years were characterized by chemical analysis, x-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, polarized light microscopy, and solubility measurements. The combined results identified the biomineral as an apatitic calcium phosphate salt with substantial incorporation of sodium, magnesium and carbonate. The average Ca/PO4 ratio for this young"" pathologic biomineral was approximately 1.3, considerably lower than approximately 1.7 found in mature atherosclerotic plaque biomineral and mature skeletal biomineral, both of which approximate hydroxyapatite in composition. Deproteinated calcific deposits from bioprostheses had thermodynamic solubilities comparable to those of both atherosclerotic plaque, typical pathologic biomineral and hydrolyzed octacalcium phosphate (OCP, Ca4H(PO4)3 x 2.5 H2O), a proposed precursor phase to biomineral apatite. This later finding, together with chemical composition and structural details of the bioprosthetic deposits themselves, supports a mechanism of cardiovascular calcification in which OCP plays a crucial role in the formation of the final apatitic phase. This suggests an approach toward prevention of bioprosthetic tissue calcification through control of the formation of the kinetically favored OCP precursor and/or its transformation into bioapatite.""",Excluded
1863,"Irradiation and free tissue transfer in head and neck cancer The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of surgery, irradiation, and free tissue transfer in locally advanced head and neck cancer patients. Forty-one patients with head and neck cancer were treated with surgery, irradiation, and free tissue transfer for reconstruction from 1977 to 1987. The age range was 38 to 78 years with a median age of 61. Patients were staged using the AJCC (1978) staging system. Eighty-four percent of the patients were in stage III or IV. The common sites of primary tumors were the oral cavity (22) and oropharynx (10). Forty patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 1 patient had basal cell carcinoma. Six patients had preoperative irradiation, and the rest had postoperative irradiation. The most common surgical procedures were partial glossectomy and neck dissection (17 patients) and wide excision of the primary and neck dissection (17 patients). The most common types of free tissue transfer were dorsalis pedis (13 patients) and scapular flaps (6 patients). The primary site was controlled in 22 patients (54%) and the neck in 36 patients (88%). Three patients (7.3%) had flap failure which required further surgical management. Eighteen patients are living with no evidence of disease with a median follow-up of 18 months (5-101 months), 10 patients are living with disease with a median follow-up of 9 months (3-40 months), 9 patients are dead of disease with a median survival of 13 months (6-54 months), and 4 patients are lost for follow-up.

Study Design: Prospective blinded study. Setting(s): Tertiary care cancer center. Subjects and Methods: Informed consent was obtained and data collected from 52 consecutive previously untreated patients with HNSCC and clinical evidence of cervical metastasis. All patients underwent conventional evaluation for HNSCC and whole body PET/CT. Data were evaluated by 5 independent reviewers, who performed TNM staging per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (seventh edition) manual and proposed a treatment plan prior to viewing, and after reviewing, PET/CT. Cases where at least 3 of 5 reviewers agreed were considered significant. Result(s): There were 0 patients for whom review of the PET/CT altered the T-class assessment (95% CI, 0-6.8), 12 (23.1%) for whom PET/CT altered N classification (95% CI, 12.5-34.5), and 2 (3.8%) for whom PET/CT altered the M classification (95% CI, 0.5-13.2). For 5 patients (9.6%), overall stage was altered per PET/CT review (95% CI, 3.2-21). For 3 patients (5.8%), PET/CT findings prompted reviewers to alter treatment recommendations (95% CI, 1.2-15.9). Conclusion(s): When added to more conventional patient evaluation, PET/CT results in changes to the TNM categories, but overall staging and treatment were less frequently affected. Whether PET/CT should be used routinely for patients with stage III and IV HNSCC is still subjective and merits further study.Copyright © American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2018.",Excluded
744,"Insufficient Vitamin D Response to Solar Radiation in German Patients with Type 2 Diabetes or Gestational Diabetes Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in all forms of diabetes mellitus. Recently, we reported how ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation affected vitamin D [25(OH)D3] concentrations in patients with type 1 diabetes. Our aim was to analyze whether patients with non-autoimmune diabetes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) also show the same vitamin D profile in relation to environmental factors including ambient temperature as an indirect parameter for outdoor activities. We analyzed 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM (n=349) and GDM patients (n=327) at the University Hospital Frankfurt from 2005 to 2007. Additionally, daily UVB and monthly outside air temperature measurements for Frankfurt/Germany were obtained. We detected a positive correlation between UVB irradiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations of T2DM and GDM patients (rho=0.50 and rho=0.63, p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively). UVB irradiation was in summer (April-October) higher than in winter (November-March) (5.6 kJ/m vs. 0.5 kJ/m, p<0.0001). However, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in summer remained high with 76% in T2DM and 59% in GDM. In a stepwise regression analysis for the 25(OH)D3 concentration, significant predictors were outdoor temperature (estimate=0.02, p<0.0001), UVB radiation (estimate=-0.0015, p=0.02), year (2006 vs. 2005 estimate=-0.06, p>0.05, 2007 vs. 2005: estimate=-0.13, p<0.0001) and diabetes type (estimate=0.06, p=0.03). In conclusion, the strong correlation between UVB radiation and 25(OH)D3 concentrations in T2DM and GDM patients determines the seasonal variation. Additional determinants for the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were outdoor temperature, year, and diabetes type. Despite the effects of solar radiation both patients groups remain largely vitamin D deficient during summers.Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.",Excluded

To assess whether nimustine (ACNU), a drug that can cross the blood brain barrier, combined with radiotherapy, improved the survival of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). Clinical materials and methods. Between 1995 and 2005, we treated 63 immunocompetent PCNSL patients with combination therapy consisting of intra-arterial ACNU (100mg/m 2) and whole brain radiotherapy (36-50Gy). Their median age was 60 years (range 28-81). The median follow-up was 24 months. Findings. With this regimen we achieved a complete response rate of 75% (43 of 57 patients). Kaplan-Meier estimates for median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 26 and 39 months, respectively. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 36-65%) and 32% (95% CI, 17-47%), respectively. By multivariate analysis, age (<60 vs. >=60 years) was the only statistically significant prognostic factor; the WBRT dose, sex, and number of tumors were not significant prognostic factors in this study. Myelosuppression was the most frequent side effect, 60% of patients experienced grade 3-4 leukopenia. Late neurotoxicity as a result of treatment was observed in 14 of 43 patients (34%) and higher age (>60) was associated with a high risk of neurotoxicity. Conclusion. The intra-arterial administration of ACNU combined with radiation therapy yielded a high response rate at acceptable toxicity levels in younger patients with PCNSL. However, late neurotoxicity was a serious complication in patients above 60 years of age. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

The sensitivity of the method was compared with chest radiography for detecting radiation-induced changes in the lung, regional alterations within (irradiated region) and outside (shielded region) the treatment ports, effect of irradiated lung volume, and dependence on time after radiotherapy., METHODS: Serial DTPA lung clearance studies were performed before the first radiation treatment (baseline), then weekly during a 5- to 7-wk course, and up to 12 times post-therapy over periods of 56-574 days. The total activity deposited in the lungs for each study was approximately 150 microCi (approximately 5.6 MBq). DTPA clearance, expressed in terms of the biological half-time, t 1/2, was computed from the slopes of the least-squares fit regression lines of the time-activity curves for the first 10 min for irradiated and shielded lung regions., RESULTS: Major findings include: (a) significant and early DTPA t 1/2 changes were observed in all patients during and after radiotherapy; (b) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in both irradiated and shielded lung regions in all patients suggesting a radiation-induced systemic reaction; (c) changes in DTPA t 1/2 values were correlated (p < 0.05) with the irradiated lung volumes; (d) significantly reduced DTPA t 1/2 values were observed in three patients who subsequently presented with clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes consistent with radiation pneumonitis (t1/2 felt to 19% +/- 6% of baseline values, compared with 64% +/- 17% in the remaining patients [p < 0.01]); (e) the onset of decreased DTPA t 1/2 values in these three patients occurred 35-84 days before clinical symptoms and/or radiographic changes; and (f) DTPA t 1/2 tended to approach baseline values with time after radiotherapy, suggesting a long-term recovery in lung injury., CONCLUSION: These observations show significant and early alterations in DTPA lung clearance during and after radiotherapy that may provide a sensitive assay to monitor changes in radiation-induced lung injury and may facilitate early therapeutic intervention.",Included
870,"A guide to mammography and other breast imaging procedures Mammographic studies are performed for both diagnosis of breast disease and screening for cancer. Diagnostic mammography can demonstrate the presence of breast cancer in a symptomatic patient and more specifically, the size, location and extent of tumor. Mammographic screening involves examination of asymptomatic women in an attempt to detect breast cancer before it grows large enough to be palpable. The use of diagnostic mammography is well accepted due to the compelling clinical need for the information provided. The implementation of a mammographic screening program depends upon: (1) indication of a favorable benefit/risk ratio for the population being screened; (2) availability of suitably trained radiologists, medical physicists, and technologists and appropriate mammographic equipment subject to a vigorous QA program; and (3) acceptably low cost. Breast anatomy and function must be understood (Section 2) in order to design and utilize the mammographie techniques which will effectively detect and demonstrate breast cancer. The technique which is employed for the preponderance of mammography examinations is screen-film mammography with a grid. Good screen-film mammography requires dedicated equipment which can provide an appropriate soft x-ray beam (proper choice of operating potential, target, filter, window, HVL) (Section 3), proper compression, a target-film distance of suitable length for the given focal-spot size, and provision for vertical adjustment and mechanical rotation of the tube and image-receptor assembly for proper positioning (Section 2). The two views, which are recommended, are the CC and the MLO view (Section 2) which allow more visualization of the posterior glandular tissues, particularly in the auxiliary tail than a lateral view. The lateral view should also be employed whenever a nonpalpable lesion is discovered, in order to provide accurate three-dimensional localization. Screen-film mammography should be performed by a technologist who has had special training in compression and positioning techniques for the standard and special views used for mammography (ACR, 1999). Only an intensifying screen designed specifically for mammography should be used in combination with a suitable single-emulsion film (Section 3). The combination should be placed in low-absorption cassettes designed for mammography. There are many factors which affect image quality (Section 4). The three major components of image quality are contrast, sharpness and noise. Image quality can be optimized by suitable adjustment of the x-ray spectrum (operating potential, filtration, target material), breast compression, grids, imaging geometry (small focal spot, long target-film distance), choice of screens and films, and optimization of film-processing techniques. Image quality may be checked with suitable phantoms. Section 4 provides information to allow facilities to determine whether the particular combination of x-ray machine, compression devices, technique factors and image receptors in current use, or under consideration for use, for mammography will provide optimum image quality. A major objective of mammography dosimetry is to provide relevant information so that potential radiation risks from alternative techniques may be compared. For this purpose a single-valued dose"" per view for each technique, which corresponds reasonably well to the resulting carcinogenic potential, should be determined. This task involves consideration of tissue vulnerability to radiation effects, anatomy, technique and dosimetry. In addition, a unique dose value for each technique requires that the dose be determined for a fixed-reference breast composition with breast thickness stated. Simple computational models of the breast have been developed for estimation of mammographic dose. Several assumptions are implicit in these models relating to radiation risk, breast anatomy, and technique (Section 5). Three specific points are relevant to radiation risk: (1) breast glandular tissue is most vulnerable as compared with adipose, skin and areo ar tissues; (2) an average breast dose (namely, the mean glandular dose), rather than a maximum dose, is most useful in characterizing risk of carcinogenesis consistent with a linear dose-response relationship; and (3) the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older since younger women are likely to receive only diagnostic and baseline studies. This assumption that the population of primary interest is women 40 y and older limits application of the computational models to the older on average, more adipose breast, which helps justify certain simplifying assumptions. A major technique variable is the degree of compression employed. Firm compression, which is assumed in dose computations, greatly distorts the breast anatomy, making more rectangular the sagittal and transverse cross-sections of the volume that includes the glandular tissue. This greatly simplifies the breast geometry and makes the computational models more appropriate than otherwise would be the case (Section 5). The mean glandular dose (D<inf>g</inf>) meets the stated requirements outlined above. The computational model used in this Report for D<inf>g</inf> assumes that 0.5 cm thick adipose layers enclose a central ""glandular tissue"" containing a uniform mix of glandular and adipose tissues in roughly equal amounts. The procedure for estimating mean glandular dose for a specific population of patients is described in Table 4.3 (Approach II). A basic requirement for maintaining optimum image quality in mammography is implementation of a suitable QA program (Section 6). Each of the items contributing to image quality must be evaluated on a regular basis. The quality administration program (medical audit) evaluates the appropriateness and accuracy of image interpretation (Section 6.3). The benefit from screening by mammography and physical examination in the form of decreased breast cancer mortality has long been accepted for women above age 50 on the basis of a randomized trial (the HIP study, see Section 7), which indicated that the contribution of mammography to decreased breast cancer mortality was significant in older women. The randomized clinical trials of mammographic screening have not demonstrated a benefit for women age 40 to 49, within the first 7 y of starting screening. Those trials for which 10 or more years of follow-up is available, show evidence of a 23 percent benefit in reducing mortality. Although this reduction is smaller than that observed for older women, it is statistically significant and therefore, one can reject the possibility that this may have happened by chance. Compared with mammography practiced in the previous randomized trials, high-quality modern mammography could result in increased benefit. Even a very small benefit (e.g., one percent) more than offsets any risk of radiation-induced breast cancer. The benefit versus risk will be substantial, if analysis of ongoing screening experience demonstrates a reduction in breast cancer mortality rate of 30 percent or more. Among the various imaging methods designed to evaluate the breast for cancer, mammography is the most accurate and most widely used. It has gained clinical acceptance primarily because of its ability to detect a cancer before the tumor mass becomes large enough to be palpable, thereby permitting ""early"" diagnosis. It has also been proven an invaluable tool to distinguish benign from malignant lesions and can facilitate prompt biopsy of cancers, while encouraging clinical observation (rather than biopsy) of many benign masses. Other breast imaging methods have, thus far, been considered less successful; these include thermography, transillumination, ultrasonography, and MRI and MRS all of which do not utilize ionizing radiation. Computed tomography (Section 8.4) and digital mammography (Section 3.3) which use x rays, and therefore involve the potential risk of mammary carcinogenesis are being subjected to clinical investigation to determine their role in breast cancer diagnosis. Explanations of the principles of operation, a chronology of developments, an an extensive discussion of the limitations of each of these methods is contained in Sections 3.3 and 8.4.""",Excluded
2388,"Age assessment by magnetic resonance imaging of the knee: A preliminary study The authors developed an original magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging system for epiphyseal fusion of growth plate maturation of the knee and evaluated its reliability and validity for age assessment of living individuals. A total of 290 MRI scans of the knee were reviewed retrospectively in patients aged from 10 to 30 years old (138 males, 152 females). Five original MRI stages were defined to assess the degree of maturation of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. Intra-observer variability was excellent and inter-observer variability was good, demonstrating the reliability and the validity of this original MRI staging system. In both sexes, the changes of growth plates (proximal tibial or distal femoral) were associated with age (p < 0.001). Our results agreed with classic data on skeletal maturation of the knee, with globally earlier maturation in females than in males, and also earlier maturation of the proximal tibial epiphysis than of the distal femoral epiphysis. MRI of the knee is an efficient non-invasive method of age assessment, without the disadvantage of X-ray exposure.

3224,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included

All patients had constant and persistent diplopia unresponsive to other treatments acceptable to the patient. The median duration of diplopia was 5.5 years (interquartile range was 2.4-17.3 years). The postoperative VF-14 ranged from 75 to 100, and the mean VF-14 was 91 (95% CI 83-99). Three patients reported a maximum score of 100. Patient satisfaction ranged from 2 to 4, and the average was 3.4 out of 4., CONCLUSIONS: Opaque IOL insertion is a valuable option in the management of intractable diplopia. The VF-14 revealed very little or no impairment in visual function following the procedure. All patients reported improvement in their visual function and were pleased with the final outcome.",Excluded
1168,"[Non-Parametric Analysis of Radiation Risks of Mortality among Chernobyl Clean-Up Workers] Analysis of the relationship between dose and mortality from cancer and circulation diseases in the cohort of Chernobyl clean-up workers based on the data from the National Radiation and Epidemiological Registry was performed. Medical and dosimetry information on the clean-up workers, males, who got radiation doses from April 26, 1986 to April 26, 1987, which was accumulated from 1992 to 2012, was used for the analysis. The total size of the cohort was 42929 people, 12731 deaths were registered in the cohort, among them 1893 deaths from solid cancers and 5230 deaths were from circulation diseases. An average age of the workers was 39 years in 1992 and the mean dose was 164 mGy. The dose-effect relationship was estimated with the use of non-parametric analysis of survival with regard to concurrence of risks of mortality. The risks were estimated in 6 dose groups of similar size (1-70, 70-130, 130-190, 190-210, 210-230 and.230-1000 mGy). The group ""1-70 mGy"" was used as control. Estimated dose-effect relationship related to cancers and circulation diseases is described approximately with a linear model, coefficient of determination (the proportion of variability explained by the linear model) for cancers was 23-25% and for circulation diseases - 2-13%. The slope coefficient of the dose-effect relationship normalized to 1 Gy for the ratio of risks for cancers in the linear model was 0.47 (95% CI: -0.77, 1.71), and for circulation diseases it was 0.22 (95% CI: -0.58, 1.02). Risks coefficient (slope coefficient of excess mortality at a dose of 1 Gy) for solid cancers was 1.94 (95% CI: - 3.10, 7.00) x 10(-2) and for circulation diseases it was 0.67 (95% CI: -9.61, 11.00) x 10(-2). 137 deaths from radiation-induced cancers and 47 deaths from circulation diseases were registered during a follow up period.",Included
60,"Comparison of the Demarcation Line on ASOCT After Simultaneous LASIK and Different Protocols of Accelerated Collagen Crosslinking: A Bilateral Eye Randomized Study PURPOSE: To compare the demarcation line depth after 2 different protocols of simultaneous laser in situ keratomileusis and collagen crosslinking (LASIK Xtra)., METHODS: Twenty-three patients receiving bilateral LASIK Xtra were included in this comparative interventional study. The corneal stroma was soaked with 0.22% riboflavin for 90 seconds before flap repositioning. One eye was then randomized to receive either 18 mW/cm of ultraviolet A irradiation for 120 seconds or for 180 seconds, whereas the fellow eye received the other irradiation duration. The demarcation line on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography and grading of corneal haze on slit lamp were compared at postoperative month 1., RESULTS: The average age was 29.0 +/- 8.2 years. There was no statistical difference in preoperative spherical equivalent refraction (P > 0.05). At postoperative 1 month, a well-defined demarcation line was visible in 74% and 70% in the 2- and 3-minute groups, respectively. The demarcation line depth was 282 +/- 51 mum and 284 +/- 43 mum, respectively (P = 1), and the ratio of the demarcation line depth to the postoperative central corneal thickness was 0.69 +/- 0.13 and 0.72 +/- 0.10 (P = 0.61). There was no difference in the percentage of eyes with grade 1 or 2 corneal haze (P = 0.76)., CONCLUSIONS: The depth of the demarcation line was the same after receiving 18-mW/cm irradiation for either 2 or 3 minutes. The amount of early postoperative corneal haze was also similar. We postulate that there was lack of oxygen in the corneal tissue to fuel the photochemical reaction despite given additional time.",Excluded
393,"[Phosphorylation of histone H2AX in human lymphocytes as a possible marker of effective cellular response to ionizing radiation] DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) which occurs in cells after ionizing radiation (IR) or chemical agents are the most dangerous lesions in eukariotic cells, which leads to cell death or chromosome abberations and cancer. One of the earliest response of cells to DSBs formation is phosphorylation by 139 serine of core variant histone H2AX in megabase chromatin domains around DSB (gamma-H2AX), which amplify signal and makes it possible to identify even one DSB in genome. Effective formation of gamma-H2AX is very important for maintenance of genome stability. Here, using immunofluorescent and Western blotting techniques, we studied dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in human lymphocytes of various individuals irradiated ex vivo. We have found that dynamics of gamma-H2AX formation in lymphocytes differ between individuals but have similar kinetics and statistically is independent on people age.",Included

Cytogenetic analysis (1000 metaphase plate per individual) and genotyping at 19 sites of genes involved in detoxification and DNA repair were performed in a sample of 83 Chernobyl liquidators and a matched control sample of 96 volunteers. In either sample, the frequency of chromosome aberrations was higher in carriers of the minor alleles of the XPD gene (sites 2251T > G and 862G > A) and the positive genotypes of the GSTM1-GSTT1 genes. The highest frequency of chromosome aberrations was observed in carriers of a combined genotype including at least one minor allele of the XPD sites + at least one insertion in the GSTM1-GSTT1 genes. The high-risk genotype, which had a prevalence of 64%, was strongly associated with a higher frequency of chromosome aberrations in both volunteers (OR = 6.9, P = 0.008) and Chernobyl liquidators (OR = 5.6, P = 0.002).",Excluded
45,"Optimizing radiation exposure in screening of body packing: image quality and diagnostic acceptability of an 80 kVp protocol with automated tube current modulation The aim of this study was to evaluate the objective and subjective image quality of a novel computed tomography (CT) protocol with reduced radiation dose for body packing with 80 kVp and automated tube current modulation (ATCM) compared to a standard body packing CT protocol. 80 individuals who were examined between March 2012 and July 2015 in suspicion of ingested drug packets were retrospectively included in this study. Thirty-one CT examinations were performed using ATCM and a fixed tube voltage of 80 kVp (group A). Forty-nine CT examinations were performed using a standard protocol with a tube voltage of 120 kVp and a fixed tube current time product of 40 mAs (group B). Subjective and objective image quality and visibility of drug packets were assessed. Radiation exposure of both protocols was compared. Contrast-to-noise ratio (group A: 0.56 +/- 0.36; group B: 1.13 +/- 0.91) and Signal-to-noise ratio (group A: 3.69 +/- 0.98; group B: 7.08 +/- 2.67) were significantly lower for group A compared to group B (p < 0.001). Subjectively, image quality was decreased for group A compared to group B (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.4; p < 0.001). Attenuation of body packets was higher with the new protocol (group A: 362.2 +/- 70.3 Hounsfield Units (HU); group B: 210.6 +/- 60.2 HU; p = 0.005). Volumetric Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) and Dose Length Product (DLP) were significantly lower in group A (CTDIvol 2.2 +/- 0.9 mGy, DLP 105.7 +/- 52.3 mGycm) as compared to group B (CTDIvol 2.7 +/- 0.1 mGy, DLP 126.0 +/- 9.7 mGycm, p = 0.002 and p = 0.01). The novel 80 kVp CT protocol with ATCM leads to a significant dose reduction compared to a standard CT body packing protocol. The novel protocol led to a diagnostic image quality and cocaine body packets were reliably detected due to the high attenuation.",Excluded
1915,"Radiation- and Age-Associated Changes in Peripheral Blood Dendritic Cell Populations among Aging Atomic Bomb Survivors in Japan Previous immunological studies in atomic bomb survivors have suggested that radiation exposure leads to long-lasting changes, similar to immunological aging observed in T-cell-adaptive immunity. However, to our knowledge, late effects of radiation on dendritic cells (DCs), the key coordinators for activation and differentiation of T cells, have not yet been investigated in humans. In the current study, we hypothesized that numerical and functional decreases would be observed in relationship to radiation dose in circulating conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) among 229 Japanese A-bomb survivors. Overall, the evidence did not support this hypothesis, with no overall changes in DCs or functional changes observed with radiation dose. Multivariable regression analysis for radiation dose, age and gender effects revealed that total DC counts as well as subpopulation counts decreased in relationship to increasing age. Further analyses revealed that in women, absolute numbers of pDCs showed significant decreases with radiation dose. A hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles in DCs after Toll-like receptor stimulation in vitro identified two clusters of participants that differed in age-associated expression levels of genes involved in antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production in cDCs. These results suggest that DC counts decrease and expression levels of gene clusters change with age. More than 60 years after radiation exposure, we also observed changes in pDC counts associated with radiation, but only among women.",Included
783,"Concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in parotid gland undifferentiated carcinoma Aims and background: Undifferentiated carcinoma of the parotid gland is a poor-prognosis lesion. Results in unresectable lesions, treated with radiotherapy alone, are very disappointing. Method(s): Six patients with T3-4 N0-1 inoperable lesions were treated with conventional radiotherapy (64-70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction 5 times a week) and concomitant cisplatin (100 mg/m2, days 1, 22 and 43). Four weeks after radiotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin, 80 mg/m2, day 1, + VP16, 100 mg/m2, days 1, 3 and 5, q = 3 weeks, for 3 cycles) was given. Result(s): A median dose of 66 Gy (range, 64-70 Gy) was delivered, and all patients received 3 courses of cisplatin during radiotherapy. Five of 6 patients received all three chemotherapeutic adjuvant courses. Two months after the end of treatment, 3 CR (50%), 2 PR (33%) and 1 NC (16%) was observed. Median CR and PR duration was 26+ and 10 months, respectively. Median overall survival was 18 months. No severe acute or late toxicity was observed.

99,"Splinting the degenerative basal joint: Custom-made or prefabricated neoprene? The purpose of this study was to compare the objective, subjective, and radiographic responses of patients with carpometacarpal joint osteoarthritis (CMCJ-OA) wearing a prefabricated neoprene splint (PFN), which crosses the CMCJ and metacarpophalangeal joint, with those of patients wearing a custom-made thermoplastic short opponens splint (CMT), which crosses only the CMCJ. Patients (N = 25) with first CMCJ stage I and II osteoarthritis were assigned randomly to wear either the PFN splint or the CMT splint for one week. After one week, the subjects rated their function in the splint and their satisfaction and pain levels on visual analogue scales. Pinch measurements were performed and x-rays were taken to assess carpometacarpal subluxation. The second splint was then applied for one week and all measures were repeated. The subjects rated the PFN splint significantly higher, and most reported that they would choose the PFN splint over the CMT splint for daily and long-term use. Both pain and function were improved with splinting, but the effect was amplified with the PFN splint compared with the CMT splint. Both splints reduced subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint, but the CMT effect was greater. This study further supports current evidence that subjects with stage I and II first CMCJ-OA will have pain relief with thumb splinting. In addition, the PFN splint will provide greater relief when compared with the CMT splint. Furthermore, this study reveals that patients prefer the PFN splint to the CMT splint.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): According to the anatomic region imaged, seven diagnostic and 16 therapeutic IR procedures performed between 2002 and 2010 were retrospectively investigated with regard to exposure setting parameters and frequency. Dose-area products (DAPs), cumulative doses (CDs), and irradiation time values were analyzed on a sample of 1,100 examinations. DAP distributions (median, mean, and percentiles) were adjunctively determined by using bootstrap resampling in PCXMC software to estimate patient effective dose. Data provided by the Radiological Information System allowed collective effective and per-capita doses to obtained. Result(s): The exposure parameters showed widespread variability. The median DAP values for pelvic arteriography and pelvic arterial angioplasty/stent placement were 10,015 and 19,424 cGy.cm2, respectively. For the 23 procedures studied, the estimated average per-procedure effective dose ranged from 0.34 to 104.9 mSv. The pelvis (37%) was the region most often imaged in diagnostic procedures, and angioplasty/stent treatment of vessels was the most frequently performed therapeutic procedure (44%). During the study period, IR procedures increased in frequency (+137%), with a consequent increase in the per-capita dose (0.172 to 0.461 mSv) and collective dose (21 to 58 man-Sv/y).

To evaluate the maintenance of T-cell memory within A-bomb survivors 60 years after radiation exposure, we examined functionally distinct memory CD4 T-cell subsets in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the survivors., METHODS: Three functionally different subsets of memory CD4 T cells were identified by differential CD43 expression levels and measured using flow cytometry. These subsets consist of functionally mature memory cells, cells weakly responsive to antigenic stimulation, and those cells functionally anergic and prone to spontaneous apoptosis., RESULTS: The percentages of these subsets within the peripheral blood CD4 T-cell pool all significantly increased with age. Percentages of functionally weak and anergic subsets were also found to increase with radiation dose, fitting to a log linear model. Within the memory CD4 T-cell pool, however, there was an inverse association between radiation dose and the percentage of functionally mature memory cells., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the steady state of T cell memory, which is regulated by cell activation and/or cell survival processes in subsets, may have been perturbed by prior radiation exposure among A-bomb survivors.",Included

Background(s): Routine cath prior to Fontan has been utilized for years; noninvasive methods, however, may be sufficient. Method(s): This study reviews clinical data in 119 consecutive patients investigating 3 groups: those who underwent CMR alone (MR; n = 41), cath alone (C; n = 41), or both cath and CMR (C+M; n = 37) prior to Fontan. Result(s): No clinically significant differences were noted in patient characteristics, hemodynamics, or clinical status prior to or after surgery between the C and MR groups. CMR added information in 82%. There were no discrepant findings between CMR and cath data in the C+M group. Diagnostic success was <95% in all groups. Of those undergoing Fontan completion, the C+M group had similar outcomes to C and MR; C and CMR were utilized in combination to assess aortopulmonary collaterals or the need for an intervention or evaluate its success. Echo could not delineate pulmonary arterial anatomy in 46% to 53% of patients. The C+M and C groups were exposed to 6.8 +/- 4.1 mSv of radiation. Conclusion(s): Single ventricle patients not requiring an intervention can undergo successful Fontan completion with CMR and echo alone with similar short-term outcomes to C, which was used as a control, preventing an invasive test and exposure to radiation. CMR can add information in a significant number of patients. Cath and CMR are utilized together for interventions and assessment of aortopulmonary collaterals. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded

Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007).

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of NAC plus IMRT and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) plus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) on locoregionally advanced NPC. Method(s): Between January 2004 and December 2008, 240 cases of locoregionally advanced NPC confirmed by pathologic assessment in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were reviewed. Of the 240 patients, 117 received NAC followed by IMRT, and 123 were treated with CCRT plus AC. The NAC + IMRT group received a regimen that included cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The CCRT + AC group received cisplatin concurrently with radiotherapy, and subsequently received adjuvant cisplatin and 5-FU. The survival rates were assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the survival curves were compared using a log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Result(s): The 5-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 78.0, 87.9, 79.0, and 69.8%, respectively, for the NAC + IMRT group and 78.7, 84.8, 76.2, and 65.6%, respectively, for the CCRT + AC group. There were no significant differences in survival between the two groups. In multivariate analysis, age (<50 years vs. >=50 years) and overall stage (III vs. IV) were found to be independent predictors for OS and DFS; furthermore, the overall stage was a significant prognostic factor for DMFS. Compared with the CCRT + AC protocol, the NAC + IMRT protocol significantly reduced the occurrence rates of grade 3-4 nausea-vomiting (6.5 vs. 1.5%, P = 0.023) and leukopenia (9.7 vs. 0.8%, P = 0.006).

Efficacy of a potential quarantine treatment dose was evaluated for its practicality by a small scale-up validation test at a commercial facility., MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-ray treatments at different doses of 50, 100, 200, and 300 Gy were carried out with eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of SWD. The trial at the commercial facility was performed with pupae at 150 Gy., RESULTS: X-ray radiation inhibited development of all stages of SWD, and the estimated dose to cause 99% mortality or to prevent emergence (ED99) are reported here. Irradiation to eggs inhibited hatching, pupariation and adult emergence at 1962, 649 and 31 Gy, respectively. The inhibition of irradiated larvae to adult emergence was 66 Gy. Irradiation to pupae could not inhibit adult emergence completely even at 300 Gy. However, irradiation at 100 Gy and above induced complete adult sterility. Irradiation to pupae inhibited hatching of F1 eggs at 73 Gy, while for adults, total inhibition of F1 egg hatching was observed at 822 Gy. In the trial at the commercial facility, radiation at 150 Gy to pupae induced complete adult sterility in all combinations of cross-mating between treated or untreated males and females., CONCLUSION: This study suggests that X-ray radiation can be recommended as an alternative to methyl bromide as phytosanitary treatment for quarantine purpose.",Included

DNA DSB induction was investigated 30 min post exposure to neutron doses ranging from 0.125 to 2 Gy. Repair kinetics was studied at different time points after a 1 Gy neutron dose. Our results indicated that gamma-H2AX foci formation was 40% higher at HDR exposure compared to LDR exposure. The maximum gamma-H2AX foci levels decreased gradually to 1.65 +/- 0.64 foci/cell (LDR) and 1.29 +/- 0.45 (HDR) at 24 h postirradiation, remaining significantly higher than background levels. This illustrates a significant effect of dose rate on neutron-induced DNA damage. While no significant difference was observed in residual DNA damage after 24 h, the DSB repair half-life of LDR exposure was slower than that of HDR exposure. The results give a first indication that the dose rate should be taken into account for cancer risk estimations related to neutrons.",Included
2949,"Facial skin rejuvenation by autologous dermal microfat transfer in photoaged patients: Clinical evaluation and skin surface digital profilometry analysis Cumulative long-term exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation promotes premature skin aging characterized by wrinkle formation and reduced skin elasticity. In this study, we assessed whether microfat transfer could improve dermal and subcutaneous tissue thickness loss associated with photoaging. Twenty-one patients affected by facial photoaging (photodamage grade II-IV; age range 35-62 years; 19 females, 2 males; all of Caucasian origin) were treated using minimally invasive autologous dermal white fat transfer harvested with a recently designed microcannula. The results were determined by clinical assessment and patient self-evaluation and quantified by the Antera 3D dermal digital device for noninvasive, objective, reliable, and accurate assessment of facial skin texture, color, and wrinkle characteristics. Compared with the pretreatment condition, the increment in soft tissue volume and improvement in skin quality and texture were assessed by a dermatologist after treatment. In addition, instrumental evaluation by digital skin profilometry of the treated areas revealed a 41% reduction in average wrinkle depth (7.29 +/- 1.04 x 10-2 mm pretreatment vs. 4.31 +/- 1.16 x 10-2 mm at 90 days posttreatment; p < 0.001), improved skin texture, more homogeneous and uniform skin color, and declined facial hemoglobin and melanin concentrations. The majority of patients (above 90%) reported improvements in self-perception. No significant complications were reported throughout the study. In conclusion, by using digital profilometry analysis as an objective and innovative tool to determine the outcome of treatment, we demonstrated that autologous microfat transfer is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with measurable beneficial effects on facial skin aging.Copyright © 2017 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons",Excluded
390,"Diet and melanoma in a case-control study Background: Malignant melanoma has been one of the most rapidly increasing cancers within the United States with few modifiable risk factors. This study investigates risk related to dietary factors, which are potentially modifiable. Method(s): Newly diagnosed patients with melanoma (n = 502) were recruited from pigment lesion clinics and controls (n = 565) were recruited from outpatient clinics. To investigate the relationship between melanoma and dietary factors in this case-control study, study subjects were requested to complete a food frequency questionnaire, which assessed diet over the previous year. Using logistic regression, odds ratios (ORs) for melanoma were computed for nutrient and alcohol intake. Result(s): Persons in high versus low quintiles of energy-adjusted vitamin D, alphacarotene, beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein, and lycopene had significantly reduced risk for melanoma (ORs <= 0.67), which remained after adjustment for presence of dysplastic nevi, education, and skin response to repeated sun exposure. Addition of micronutrients from supplements did not add an additional reduction in risk. High alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk for melanoma, which remained after adjustment for confounders [OR (95% confidence interval) in highest versus lowest quintiles, 1.65 (1.09-2.49)]. Conclusion(s): Diets consisting of foods rich in vitamin D and carotenoids and low in alcohol may be associated with a reduction in risk for melanoma. These analyses should be repeated in large, prospective studies.",Excluded

Its treatment remains a critical challenge because of number of cases, the final cost of the procedure, the level of X-ray irradiation, and the demand of technique of fixation in osteoporotic bone. The entire closed procedure requires a strict percutaneous nailing. This offers advantages in terms of postoperative pain, per-operative irradiation, and cost. The main problem was so far the ability to insure a stable reduction in time. This point is discussed with the introduction of the ""Nail-o-Flex R"" nail.

1932,"Comparison of Whole Heart Computed Tomography Scanners for Image Quality Lower Radiation Dosing in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: The CONVERGE Registry RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Novel technology in coronary computed tomographic angiography allows assessment of coronary artery disease with high image quality (IQ). There are currently two wide detector ""whole heart"" coverage scanners available, which avoid misregistration artifacts. However, there are no data directly comparing IQ between the two scanners. The aim of the current study is to investigate if IQ is different between the most scanners of GE and Toshiba broad detector scanners., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter international cohort study comparing 236 consecutive patients who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography using whole-heart scanners; 126 patients on scanner S1 ( Aquilion ONE Vision, Toshiba), and 110 patients on scanner S2 (Revolution CT, GE Healthcare). Hounsfield units were measured using regions of interest in the descending aorta at 6 points (cranial slice, level of the visualized first, second, third, and fourth spines, and the caudal slice). We also compared the coverage length (z-axis) of the full width field of view between a single rotation of the two scanners., RESULTS: Evaluating mean CT attenuation values Hounsfield units through the scan range, are progressively reduced across the descending aorta in the S1 group, resulting in the larger difference of contrast brightness between the cranial and caudal slices compared to the S2 group (absolute difference: S2 13.0 +/- 4.4 vs S1 141.9 +/- 16.4, p < 0.0001; Percent difference: 19.3 +/- 2.1 vs -3.4 +/- 1.2, <0.0001). The standard deviation (SD) is similar at the cranial slice between the two scanners, however, the S1 group demonstrated higher SD-differential from cranial to caudal than S2 group. Median radiation exposure was significantly lower for the S2 scanner 1.50 +/- 0.75 mSv vs the S1 system 1.9 mSv (IQR 1.7-2.7 mSv) (p=0.01). Z-axis coverage was larger for the S2 scanner 152.5 mm (244 slices x 0.625 mm/slice) than 133 mm for S1 (266 slices x 0.5 mm/slice)., CONCLUSION: Although both ""volume"" scanners cover the whole heart z-axis with one beat, scans using the S1 scanner have a larger variability in attenuation values throughout the scan range, resulting in 20% increase in nonuniformity from cranial to caudal slice. Additionally, SD variation across the field of view, a metric of noise, is larger when using the S1 scanner vs the S2 scanner. These results indicate that the GE Revolution CT has more uniform contrast enhancement and more coverage, lower radiation and lower image noise compared to the Toshiba Aquilion ONE Vision system.

111,"Long-term observations of radiation-induced creatinine clearance reduction and renal parenchymal volume atrophy PURPOSE: The kidney is a dose-limiting organ for upper abdominal radiotherapy. In this study, radiation-induced kidney injury represented by changes of creatinine clearance (Ccr) and renal parenchymal volume measured by computed tomography (CT) were evaluated by analysing dose-volume histograms (DVHs) in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PGDLBCL) treated with chemoradiotherapy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight PGDLBCL patients (seventy-six kidneys) treated with chemoradiotherapy were included in this study. At least 4 years of follow-up was required for eligibility. Patients underwent (immuno-) chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy with approximately 40Gy to the whole stomach and perigastric lymph nodes. Ccr and CT were obtained at least annually. Changes of Ccr and renal parenchymal volume before and 4years after radiotherapy were compared using DVH parameters., RESULTS: Mean Ccr decreased significantly from 82.7mL/min (range, 39-124mL/min) before radiotherapy to 70.4mL/min (range, 35-109mL/min) (p=0.01) 4years after radiotherapy. Mean reduction of bilateral renal parenchymal volume was 12% (range, -5-37%) in the same time period. Ccr and renal parenchymal volume tended to lower over time more than 4years after radiotherapy. Concerning DVH analysis, V20Gy26.6% and D30%19Gy had a significant risk of bilateral renal atrophy of 14% and reduction of the Ccr20mL/min., CONCLUSION: This study revealed that there was a definite relationship between DVH, renal atrophy and Ccr reduction. V20Gy<26.6% and D30%<19Gy appeared to be safe dose constraints for a Ccr reduction of <20mL/min 4years after radiotherapy. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3243,"Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP regimen) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus cisplatin in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma Background and Objective: Clinical trials on docetaxel plus cisplatin (DDP) (TP regimen) in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still uncertain due to limited samples. This study was to compare the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus DDP in treating locally advanced NPC. Method(s): Fifty-seven patients with stage T3-4N2-3M0 NPC diagnosed pathologically from December 2005 to December 2006 were randomized into TP group (30 patients) and DDP group (27 patients). Both groups received TP regimen as induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2, repeating every 21 days for two cycles. For concurrent chemotherapy, TP group were administered docetaxel (60 mg/ m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2; DDP group were administered DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 1. Both schedules were repeated every 21 days for two cycles. Linear accelerator was used as radioactive source. Irradiation field was designed with CT-simulation and conventional fractions. Result(s): The 57 patients received 111 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and 53 of them received 103 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy; four patients ceased induction chemotherapy and three ceased concurrent chemotherapy. All patients completed radiotherapy. The major toxicity of induction chemotherapy was hematologic toxicity; the main toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were hematologic toxicity and mucositis. The occurrence rates of Grade 3-4 leucopenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in DDP groups (p < 0.05). In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the application rate of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in TP group than in DDP group (100% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.05). After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rates of the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes were 93.3% and 92.9% in TP group, and were 96.3% and 91.3% in DDP group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The short-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen on locally advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with DDP. The toxicity of the former schedule is severer than that of the latter, but it is tolerable with the use of G-CSF. The long-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen need to be further studied. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
1680,"Positive psychological outcomes of spaceflight: an empirical study INTRODUCTION: Anecdotes from astronauts and cosmonauts suggest that spaceflight can be an enriching experience with enduring positive effects. These positive mental health effects may help protect flight crews from the psychological stress inherent in such high-risk missions. The goal of this study was to identify areas of personal growth likely to result from traveling in space and explore how they were patterned., METHODS: We developed a Positive Effects of Being in Space (PEBS) Questionnaire, which included a section adapted from the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) as well as original items addressing experiences unique to spaceflight. We sent the anonymous questionnaire to 175 astronauts and cosmonauts who had flown on at least 1 mission; completed surveys were returned by 39 individuals., RESULTS: Every respondent had a positive reaction to being in space, the strongest of which related to the Earth's beauty and fragility. Respondents reported changes in both attitudes and behaviors. Respondents appeared to cluster into two groups based on the intensity of their reported changes. Response patterns did not vary by demographic group, number of missions flown, or total elapsed time in space., CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings support the idea that being in space is a meaningful experience that makes an enduring positive impression on astronauts and cosmonauts. An enhanced understanding of the salutogenic effects of space travel will contribute to the education, training, and support of future space crewmembers.",Excluded
240,"Robotic radiosurgery in the management of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies Purpose: We evaluated our therapeutic results in patients with paranasal sinus or nasal cavity malignanc ies treated by robotic radiosurgery. Materials: The medical charts of 17 patients with paranasal or nasal cavity malignancies treated by robotic radiosurgery (RRS)+/- external beam radiotherapy were assessed in this retrospective study. Robotic radiosurgery was given with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CAl. There were 9 male and 8 female patients. Primary site was maxillary sinus in 6 patients, ethmoid sinus in 5 patients, nasal cavity in 3 patients and sphenoid sinus in 1 patient. Histopatholigal diagnosis was mostly squamous cell cancer (7 cases), as other pathologies were soft tissue sarcoma (4 cases), malignant melanoma (3 cases), adenocarcinoma (1 case), and adenoid cystic carcinoma (2 cases). RRS was given as re-Irradiation in 4 patients with recurrent disease, whereas it was primary treatment modality in 13 patients (RRS alone in 7 cases with 28.5-37.5 Gy in 3-5 fractions, and boost dose after EBRT in 6 cases with 1535 Gy in 35 fractions). The median prescription isodose was 81% (range, 75-85%). Seven patients received chemotherapy either prior to RRS (3 patients), or concurrent with EBRT (3 patients), or adjuvant (1 patient). Two cases with T4 tumors received elective neck EBRT. Result(s): Median follow-up time was 21 months (7-32 months). Complete response, partial response and stabile response was obtained in 7, 3 and 2 patients respectively. Overall response rate was 59% (Complete and partial response). Progression at primary site was observed in 3 cases, as one of them died of disease and two of them died of distant metastasis. RRS was generally well tolerated. There were no grade III-IV acute RTOG toxicity. Osteoradionecrosis was detected in 2 patients (one case receiving re-irradiat ion, other case receiving 30 Gy RRS alone in 3 fractions). Those 2 patients had also serious ipsilate ral facial pain requiring narcotic analgesics, and they also received hyperbaric oxygen therapy and antibiotic therapy with no need of surgical debridement. No visual acuity loss was observed during follow-up. Minor bleeding, which was spontaneously stopped, was seen in one patient. Conclusion(s): Robotic radiosurgery seems to be an alternative and tolerable therapeutic option either in recurrent or primary paranasal sinus and nasal cavity malignancies. However, longer follow-up periods are required to see the safety of RRS particulary in terms of late effects.",Excluded
1521,"Targeted therapy for metastatic kidney cancer at a urologic outpatient clinic: Experience of partly nurse administrated treatment Introduction and Objectives: Since 2006 patients from Gothenburg with metastatic kidney cancer have been treated with targeted therapy at the outpatient clinic of the Urologic department, Sahlgrenska University Hospital. Therapy was started by a senior urologist and thereafter administrated by two specialized nurses conducting frequent visits for handing out medicine, blood checks, weight and blood pressure controls, patient education and tending of side effects. The responsible doctor was contacted when adjustment of the treatment was needed. All medicine was handed to the patients to ensure that a minimum of the drugs were wasted. Visits to the doctors were conducted every 4th to 6th month mostly at the time of X-ray or when needed. The objective of the study was to report our experience with targeted therapy at a urologic outpatient clinic performed as partly nurse administered. Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2006 and 2012, 82 patients in total were treated with targeted therapy and registered in a database. All treatment and survival data were recorded. There were 56 men and 26 women. Result(s): Eighty-two patients were treated in first line. Treatment time on targeted therapy ranged from 9 days to 3 years and 10 months (median 11.5 months). In the first line 58 (71%) of the patients had sunitinib, 13 (16%) sorafenib, 7 (8%) bevacizumab+interferon, 3 (4%) pazopanib and 1 (1%) had temsirolimus. Thirty-four treatments were started in the second line. Ten treatments were given in the third and 2 in the fourth line. In 2012 33 patients were treated. During that year 213 visits were conducted by the specialized nurses and 54 visits by a senior urologist. Conclusion(s): A partly nurse administrated outpatient treatment with targeted therapy is possible when performed in close contact with the responsible doctor. It makes it possible to follow up the patients with short intervals and provides a close contact which they can always turn to with the numerous problems these patients have without consuming too much of doctor time.",Excluded
2535,"Dosimetric Predictors of Hypothyroidism After Radical Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy for Non-metastatic Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma AIMS: To investigate dosimetric predictors of hypothyroidism after radical intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with non-metastatic NPC treated with radical IMRT from 2008 to 2013 were reviewed. Serum thyroid function tests before and after IMRT were regularly monitored. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out for predictors of biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism., RESULTS: In total, 149 patients were recruited. After a median follow-up duration of 3.1 years, 33 (22.1%) and 21 (14.1%) patients developed biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism, respectively. Eight (24.2%) patients who had biochemical hypothyroidism developed clinical hypothyroidism later. Univariable and multivariable analyses revealed that the volume of the thyroid (P=0.002, multivariable), VS60 (the absolute thyroid volume spared from 60 Gy or less) (P<0.001, multivariable) and VS45 (P<0.001, multivariable) of the thyroid were significant predictors of biochemical hypothyroidism. The freedom from biochemical hypothyroidism was longer for those whose VS60 >= 10 cm(3) (mean 90.9 versus 62.6 months; P<0.001) and VS45 >= 5 cm(3) (mean 91.9 versus 65.2 months; P=0.001). Similarly multivariable analyses revealed that VS60 (P=0.001) and VS45 (P=0.003) were significant predictors of clinical hypothyroidism. The freedom from clinical hypothyroidism was longer for those whose VS60 >= 10 cm(3) (91.5 versus 73.3 months; P=0.002) and VS45 >= 5 cm(3) (91.5 versus 75.9 months; P=0.007)., CONCLUSIONS: VS60 and VS45 of the thyroid should be considered important dose constraints against hypothyroidism without compromising target coverage during IMRT optimisation for NPC.

The subjects were 115 Balb/c mice 4 weeks of age. The animals were divided into group A (control), group B (DMH), group C (DMH+MW), and group D [DMH + 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate (TPA)]. Radiation (10 mW/cm2) was delivered dorsally with the E field parallel to the mouse's long body axis in an anechoic chamber. Radiations were administered 3 hr daily, 6 days per week, over a period of 5 months. The average SAR was estimated to be 10-12 W/kg. During the course of radiation treatments, DMH was injected once per week. The tumor promoter TPA was administered once per week for 10 weeks, from the third week on, after the initial treatment. The incidence of tumors did not significantly differ between the three test groups (groups B, C, and D; P > 0.25). However, the number of tumors, the size of the tumors, and the incidence of protuberant and infiltrative types in tumor-bearing animals were higher in group D compared to groups B and C (P < 0.05). No difference was found between groups B and C (P > 0.25). The study indicates that 2.45 GHz microwave radiation at 10 mW/cm2 power density did not promote DMH-induced colon cancers in young mice. The study also showed that TPA could accelerate colon tumor production if a tumor was initiated.",Excluded
3024,"Incidence of pseudoprogression in low-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy Background: As the incidence of pseudo-progressive disease (psPD), or pseudoprogression, in low-grade glioma (LGG) is unknown, we retrospectively investigated this phenomenon in a cohort of LGG patients given radiotherapy (RT)., Methods: All MRI scans and clinical data from patients with histologically proven LGG treated with radiation between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. PsPD was scored when a new enhancing lesion occurred after RT and subsequently disappeared or remained stable for at least a year without therapy, including dexamethasone., Results: Sixty-three out of 71 patients who received RT for LGG were deemed eligible for evaluation of psPD. The median follow-up was 5 years (range 1-10 y). PsPD was seen in 13 patients (20.6%). PsPD occurred after a median of 12 months with a range of 3-78 months. The median duration of psPD was 6 months, with a range of 2-26 months and always occurred within the RT high dose fields of at least 45 Gy. The area of the enhancement at the time of psPD was significantly smaller compared with the area of enhancement during ""true"" progression (median size 54mm2 [range 12-340mm2] vs 270mm2 [range 30-3420mm2], respectively; P = .009)., Conclusions: PsPD occurs frequently in LGG patients receiving RT. This supports the policy to postpone a new line of treatment until progression is evident, especially when patients have small contrast enhancing lesions within the RT field.

2658,"Subsequent cooling-circulation after radiofrequency and microwave ablation avoids secondary indirect damage induced by residual thermal energy PURPOSE We aimed to investigate the exact role of residual thermal energy following microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at the final ablation and transition zones and determine whether residual thermal energy could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation. METHODS In an ex vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed on fresh porcine liver, and central and border temperatures were compared. In an in vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed to the livers of New Zealand white rabbits. Tissue samples were stained with alpha-NADH-diaphorase. The coagulation zones (NADH-negative) and transition zones (lightly NADH-stained) of different groups were compared at different time points. RESULTS In the ex vivo model, the residual thermal energy after MWA and RFA could be dispersed by subsequent cooling-circulation due to the temperature decreasing rapidly. In the in vivo study, the coagulation volume in the ablation group was larger than that in the cooling-circulation group (P < 0.05) 2 days after ablation. In the ablation group, the damaged zone (the transition zone plus the coagulation zone) on alpha-NADH-diaphorase-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation and slowly reached the maximum on day 2. However, the damaged zones did not change significantly at the three time points observed in the cooling-circulation group. CONCLUSION The residual thermal energy in MWA and RFA induced secondary damage beyond the direct coagulation zone, and it could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation, contributing to smaller ablation and transition zones.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded
2319,"Racial Disparities in Lung Cancer Screening: An Exploratory Investigation Background/Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Black Americans have the highest rate of lung cancer mortality, due to being diagnosed at later stage. Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) facilitates earlier detection and has been associated with a reduction in cancer death. We investigated LCS utilization and explored racial disparities (Black vs. non-Black) in LCS among patients for whom LCS is clinically indicated. Method(s): Using electronic medical records from the Lifespan Medical System, we randomly selected 200 patients who were likely to meet U. S. Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) guidelines for LCS and mailed each patient a survey to assess LCS eligibility and uptake. Result(s): Nearly three-quarters (n = 146, 73%) completed the survey and, of survey respondents, 92% (n = 134) were eligible for the study. Among eligible patients, 35% met criteria for LCS; non-Black patients were 90% more likely to meet criteria for LCS than Black patients (44% vs. 27%). Of the patients meeting USPSTF criteria, only 21% reported being screened; eligible non-Black patients were 2.8 times more likely to have had LCS than eligible Black patients (30% vs. 12%). Conclusion(s): LCS utilization is low despite coverage provided through the Affordable Care Act. Black patients are less likely to qualify for screening and disproportionately less likely to be screened for lung cancer compared with non-Black patients. Targeted intervention strategies are needed to increase referral for and uptake of LCS in patients who are at high risk for developing lung cancer, and for Black patients in particular.Copyright © 2017 National Medical Association",Excluded

1149,"Reduction of Delayed Homologous Recombination by Induction of Radioadaptive Response in RaDR-GFP Mice (Yonezawa Effect): An Old Player With a New Role Radiotherapy (RT) treats cancer effectively with high doses of ionizing radiation (IR) to killing cancer cells and shrinking tumors while bearing the risk of developing different side effects, including secondary cancer, which is most concerning for long-term health consequences. Genomic instability (GI) is a characteristic of most cancer cells, and IR-induced GI can manifest as delayed homologous recombination (HR). Radioadaptive response (RAR) is capable of reducing genotoxicity, cell transformation, mutation, and carcinogenesis, but the rational evidence describing its contributions to the reduction of radiation risk, in particular, carcinogenesis, remains fragmented. In this work, to investigate the impact of RAR on high-dose, IR-induced GI measured as delayed HR, the frequency of recombinant cells was comparatively studied under RAR-inducible and -uninducible conditions in the nucleated cells in hematopoietic tissues (bone marrow and spleen) using the Rosa26 Direct Repeat-green fluorescent protein (RaDR-GFP) homozygote mice. Results demonstrated that the frequency of recombinant cells was significantly lower in hematopoietic tissues under RAR-inducible condition. These findings suggest that reduction in delayed HR may be at least a part of the mechanisms underlying decreased carcinogenesis by RAR, and application of RAR would contribute to a more rigorous and scientifically grounded system of radiation protection in RT.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Included
2415,"Effect of vitamin D supplementation and ultraviolet B exposure on serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in healthy volunteers: A randomized, crossover clinical trial Background Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation during the summer and vitamin D supplementation are two major sources of vitamin D for humans at northern latitudes. However, little is known about the relative efficiency of these two vitamin D sources. Objectives The main goal was to compare the efficiency of high-dose oral vitamin D3 supplementation (2000 IU per day for 30 days) with a simulated summer UV exposure [10 sunbed sessions to a total dose of 23.8 standard erythema doses (SED)] to improve vitamin D status. Methods Healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups: group 1 received vitamin D supplementation followed by 10 whole-body sunbed exposures; group 2 started with 10 sunbed exposures followed by vitamin D supplementation. Results The oral supplementation with vitamin D3 resulted in a mean (SEM) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increase of 25.3 (5.4) nmol L -1. A similar increase, 19.8 (5.4) nmol L-1, was observed after simulated summer UV exposure. At the end of the study, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were similar in both groups. Conclusions Twice-weekly whole-body sunbed exposure to a dose of 4.8 SED is equal to 2000 IU daily of oral vitamin D supplementation for 30 days and enough to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nmol L-1 in ~55% of cases. Based on our calculations, this dose corresponds to a cumulative weekly whole-body exposure of 3.4 SED (~ 40 min around midday during the summer at the latitude of Oslo). What's already known about this topic? Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and vitamin D supplementation are two major sources of vitamin D for humans. During winter months (October-March) vitamin D formation in the skin is insufficient due to the low UVB fluences at latitudes above 40degreeN. Little is known about the relative efficiency of these two vitamin D sources, with respect to efficiency in increasing serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. What does this study add? Twice-weekly whole-body UV exposure to a dose of 4.8 standard erythema doses (SED) for 5 weeks to a total dose of 23.8 SED is equal to 2000 IU daily of oral vitamin D supplementation for 30 days and enough to achieve and maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations > 75 nmol L-1 in Eoe55% of cases.

It is characterized by rapid localization and clearance from the circulation with twice the skeletal uptake and better target to background ratio as compared with the conventional 99m Tc-MDP (methyl diphosphonate) bone scan agent. Additionally, 18 F-flouride PET/CT scans provide higher spatial resolution, shorter imaging time, and slightly less radiation. Furthermore, attenuation correction using CT provides better characterization of morphology and therefore increased accuracy. An analysis of 11 cases of 18 F-fluoride PET bone scans performed between June 2009 and July 2010 demonstrated accurate characterization and localization of osseous lesions as well as nonosseous metastatic lesions. The study population consisted of seven male and four female patients between the ages of 48-68 years with primary cancers of the prostate, kidney, colon, breast, bladder, lung, and the adrenal gland. The administered dose ranged from 7.7-13.6 mCi. Eight out of eleven scans were positive for metastatic disease and three were negative. All findings were correlated with CT. Early detection of bone metastases is significant in therapy planning and monitoring. Accurate demonstration of osseous metastases helps improve patient care and patient outcome. We believe 18 F-fluoride PET/CT can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99m Tc-MDP. Educational Goals/Teaching Points: Overview of physiology, dosimetry, and clinical advantages of 18 F-NaF bone imaging compared with conventional Tc-MDP bone imaging. Key Anatomic/Physiologic Issues and Imaging Findings/Techniques: Role of 18 F-NaF PET imaging in detection of malignant and benign osseous disease. Conclusion(s): 18 F-fluoride PET/CT scans can provide more thorough and conclusive evaluation of bone disease than the conventional 99mTc-MDP.",Excluded
3354,"Reduced intensity VEPEMB regimen compared with standard ABVD in elderly Hodgkin lymphoma patients: Results from a randomized trial on behalf of the Fondazione Italiana Linfomi (FIL) Survival rates for elderly Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) have not improved substantially in recent years, mainly because of a lack of prospective randomized studies, due to difficulties in enrolling patients. Between 2002 and 2006, 54 untreated HL patients, aged between 65 and 80 years and considered 'non-frail' according to a comprehensive geriatric evaluation, were enrolled into a phase III randomized trial to compare a reduced-intensity regimen (vinblastine, cyclophosphamide, procarbazine, prednisone, etoposide, mitoxantrone, bleomycin; VEPEMB) with standard ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Seventeen patients were in early stage (I-IIA), while 37 were advanced stage. Median age was 72 years and median follow-up was 76 months. Five-year PFS rates were 48% vs. 70% [adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) = 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.94-5.10, P = 0.068] and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 63% vs. 77% (adjusted HR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.69-4.03, P = 0.254) for VEPEMB compared to ABVD. Overall treatment-related mortality was 4%. World Health Organization grade 4 cardiac and lung toxicity occurred in four patients treated with ABVD versus no cases in the VEPEMB arm. Standard ABVD regimen resulted in better PFS and OS than the VEPEMB, although the differences were not statistically significant. The low toxicity of both treatments was probably attributable to stringent selection of patients based on a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment that excluded frail patients.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
1398,"A retrospective multicenter study of carbon-ion radiotherapy for external auditory canal and middle ear carcinomas Background: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study to assess the clinical outcomes of carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for head and neck malignancies (Japan Carbon-Ion Radiation Oncology Study Group [J-CROS] study: 1402 HN). We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CIRT in patients with external auditory canal (EAC) and middle ear (ME) carcinomas. Method(s): Thirty-one patients treated with CIRT at four Japanese institutions were analyzed. Fourteen patients (45.2%) had squamous cell carcinomas, 13 (41.9%) had adenoid cystic carcinomas, and four (12.9%) had other types. Nineteen (61.3%), six (19.4%), three (9.7%), and three (9.7%) patients had T4, T3, T2, and T1 disease, respectively. All patients had N0M0 status. The median radiation dose was 64 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in 16 fractions. The median gross tumor volume was 33.3 mL. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 18.4 months (range, 5.1-85.6). The 1- and 3-year local control and overall survival rates were 75.0% and 55.0% and 79.3% and 58.7%, respectively. Regarding grade 3 or higher toxicities, three patients (9.7%) had grade 3 dermatitis, one (3.2%) had grade 3 mucositis, and two (6.5%) had grade 3 central nervous necrosis (ie, radiation-induced brain necrosis).

704,"First analysis of cancer incidence and occupational radiation exposure based on the National Dose Registry of Canada A cohort study was conducted to investigate the relation between cancer incidence and occupational exposure to ionizing radiation. Records containing dose information from 1951 to 1988 for 191,333 persons were extracted from the National Dose Registry of Canada. The records were linked to the Canadian Cancer Data Base, with incidence data from 1969 to 1988. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated using Canadian cancer incidence rates stratified by age, sex, and calendar year. Excess relative risks were obtained from internally based dose-response analyses. The following significant results were found for males and females combined: a deficit in the standardized incidence ratio for all cancers combined; elevated standardized incidence ratios for thyroid cancer and melanoma; and elevated excess relative risks for rectum, leukemia, lung, all cancers combined, all except lung, and all except leukemia. For males, cancers of the colon, pancreas, and testis also showed significantly elevated excess relative risks. The specific cancer types listed above have been implicated in previous studies on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation, except for testis, colon, and melanoma, while the findings on thyroid cancer from previous studies are inconclusive. The thyroid standardized incidence ratios in this study are highly significant, but further investigation is needed to assess the possibility of association with occupational radiation exposure.",Included
3234,"Religious belief as a coping strategy: An explorative trial in patients irradiated for head-and-neck cancer Purpose: To explore the role of religious belief in coping with disease symptoms and treatment-related side effects in patients with head-and-neck cancer under radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Prospectively collected data were used with a cohort of head-and-neck cancer patients treated by radiotherapy and epoetin beta or placebo within a double-blind multicenter trial. All patients were divided into believers and nonbelievers. Answers to a quality of life questionnaire at four points in time during radiotherapy were analyzed according to both groups. Clinical parameters and therapy side effects were controlled regularly. Result(s): 62.1% of the patients (66/105) sent back a baseline questionnaire discriminating between believers and nonbelievers. For 34.2% (40/105) data of all four measures could be obtained. On average, believers felt better in all categories of side effects at all points of time before, during and directly after therapy. Conclusion(s): Religious faith seems to play an important role in coping strategies of radiotherapy patients. More research in this area would be worthwhile. © Urban & Vogel.",Excluded
474,"Functional MR urography for assessment of obstructive and reflux uropathies Purpose - Objective. In congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) the role of MRI for classification is expanded by obtaining functional data. MAG3 scintigraphy is considered gold standard for functional analysis. Material and methods. From 04/2010 to 01/2012 20 patients from one university hospital were examined by a standardised MR urography (MRU) in a 1.5 Tesla scanner after i.v. hydration and furosemide i.v. The data was processed by a dedicated software (CHOP-fMRU). Results were compared with Tc99m MAG3 scintigraphy. Results. Twenty patients (5 female, 15 male; age 5 weeks to 18.4 years) had both MR urography and MAG3 scintigraphy (1 to 484; average 48 days). All patients had isolated or combined CAKUT (6 duplex kidneys; 7 proximal, 11 distal ureteral stenoses; 8 subvesical obstructions; 10 VUR). Split renal function values differed by an average 8.2 % (min 1 %, max 18 %). Curve types after O' Reilly were available in 36 kidneys (4 kidneys were multicystic dysplastic with no residual organ function). There was a relevant discrepancy in one case only (norml in scintigraphy, relevant obstruction in MRU). Discussion and conclusions. X-ray excretion urography was replaced by earlier MRU. The CHOP-fMRU examination protocol is very robust and reliable and able to give as much information as MAG3 scintigraphy. It is now possible to receive information on morphology, excretion, and split renal function with one examination.",Excluded
1035,"Third-generation iterative reconstruction on a dual-source, high-pitch, low-dose chest CT protocol with tin filter for spectral shaping at 100 kV: a study on a small series of COVID-19 patients OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of third-generation iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) in dual-source, high-pitch chest CT protocol with spectral shaping at 100 kVp in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHOD(S): Confirmed COVID-19 inpatients undergoing to unenhanced chest CT were scanned with a dual-energy acquisition (DECT, 90/150Sn kV) and a dual-source, high-pitch acquisition with tin-filtered 100 kVp (LDCT). On the DECT with ADMIRE 3 (DECT3) were evaluated the pulmonary findings and their extension (25-point score). Two radiologists in consensus evaluated with 5-point scales the overall image quality, the anatomical structures, and the elementary findings on LDCT reconstructed with filtered backprojection (LDCT0), with ADMIRE 3 (LDCT3) and 5 (LDCT5), and on DECT3. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the body mass index, the exposure times, and the radiation doses were recorded. RESULT(S): Seventy-five patients (57 M/18F; median age: 63 y.o.) were included, with median pulmonary extension of 13/25 points. The imaging findings were detected in proportion comparable to the available literature. The ADMIRE significantly improved the SNR in LDCT (p<0.00001) with almost no significant differences in overweight patients. The LDCT had median effective dose of 0.39 mSv and acquisition time of 0.71 s with significantly less motion artifacts than DECT (p<0.00001). The DECT3 and LDCT3 provided the best image quality and depiction of pulmonary anatomy and imaging findings, with significant differences among all the series (p<0.00001). CONCLUSION(S): The LDCT with spectral shaping and ADMIRE3 provided acceptable image quality in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19, with significantly reduced radiation dose and motion artifacts.",Excluded
612,"Quantitative distribution of iodinated contrast media in body computed tomography: data from a large reference cohort Objectives: Dual-energy computed tomography allows for an accurate and reliable quantification of iodine. However, data on physiological distribution of iodine concentration (IC) is still sparse. This study aims to establish guidance for IC in abdominal organs and important anatomical landmarks using a large cohort of individuals without radiological tumor burden. Method(s): Five hundred seventy-one oncologic, portal venous phase dual-layer spectral detector CT studies of the chest and abdomen without tumor burden at time point of imaging confirmed by > 3-month follow-up were included. ROI were placed in parenchymatous organs (n = 25), lymph nodes (n = 6), and vessels (n = 3) with a minimum of two measurements per landmark. ROI were placed on conventional images and pasted to iodine maps to retrieve absolute IC. Normalization to the abdominal aorta was conducted to obtain iodine perfusion ratios. Bivariate regression analysis, t tests, and ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Absolute IC showed a broad scatter and varied with body mass index, between different age groups and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels (range 0.0 +/- 0.0 mg/ml-6.6 +/- 1.3 mg/ml). Unlike absolute IC, iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index; however, significant differences between the sexes and age groups persisted, showing a tendency towards decreased perfusion ratios in elderly patients (e.g., liver 18-44 years/>= 64 years: 0.50 +/- 0.11/0.43 +/- 0.10, p <= 0.05). Conclusion(s): Distribution of IC obtained from a large-scale cohort is provided. As significant differences between sexes and age groups were found, this should be taken into account when obtaining quantitative iodine concentrations and applying iodine thresholds. Key Points: * Absolute iodine concentration showed a broad variation and differed between body mass index, age groups, and between the sexes in parenchymatous organs, lymph nodes, and vessels. * The iodine perfusion ratios did not show dependency on body mass index while significant differences between sexes and age groups persisted. * Provided guidance values may serve as reference when aiming to differentiate healthy and abnormal tissue based on iodine perfusion ratios.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).",Excluded
2490,"Reduced-dose CT: Effect on reader evaluation in detection of pulmonary embolism OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduction in radiation dose on CT detection of pulmonary embolism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Emergency department patients were evaluated for pulmonary embolism with standard and simulated reduced-dose CT angiography. Simulated lower-dose CT angiograms obtained at 90, 45, 22, and 10 mAseff were reconstructed by mathematical addition of noise to the standard dose (180 mAseff) data from the images of 18 patients with and 20 patients without pulmonary embolism. Four radiologists blinded to the study parameters separately interpreted each CT angiogram. Dose trends for subjective measures (diagnostic certainty, image quality, and perceived technical limitations) were evaluated, test characteristics for the detection of pulmonary embolism were computed, and clot burden was measured. RESULTS. Readers indicated significant reductions in diagnostic certainty (p < 0.02) and image quality (p < 0.02) and an increase in perceived technical limitations (p < 0.01) as the simulated radiation dose was decreased. These subjective measures also showed significant adverse dose trends when the mAseff was reduced (p < 0.001). At reduced radiation doses, the sensitivity and positive predictive value for detection of pulmonary embolism diminished significantly. The sensitivity was 0.94 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); specificity, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.98); positive predictive value, 0.95 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); and negative predictive value, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.97). All patients had a low to moderate clot burden. CONCLUSION. Reduction in dose for CT angiography in the detection of pulmonary embolism has a significant adverse effect on readers' subjective assessment of diagnostic confidence and image quality. Detection of pulmonary embolism also decreases as the tube current dose is reduced. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1590,"The evaluation of different radiological measurement parameters of the degree of collapse of the vertebral body in vertebral compression fractures For compression fracture, vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and kyphotic angle (KA) are two important imaging parameters for determining the prognosis and appropriate treatment. This study used previous measurement methods to assess the degree of VBHL and KA, compare and examine differences between various measurement methods, and examine the correlation between relevant measurement parameters and intravertebral cleft (IVC) in the vertebral body. The radiographic images (lateral view of the T-L spine) of 18 patients with a single-level vertebral compression fracture were reviewed. We measured 9 characteristic lengths and angles on plain radiographs, including anterior vertebral height (AVH) and AVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, middle vertebral height (MVH) and MVH of the adjacent upper and lower levels, posterior vertebral height (PVH), and vertebral body width, and assessed 6 parameters, including vertebral compression ratio (VBCR), percentage of anterior height compression (PAHC), percentage of middle height compression (PMHC), kyphotic angle (KA), calculated kyphotic angle (CKA), and IVC. The results showed that VBCR is a simple and rapid method of VBHL assessment, but it may result in an underestimation of the degree of VBHL compared to PAHC. When PMHC < 40% or kyphotic angle > 15degree, the probability of IVC occurring on the vertebral body was higher which means the higher risk of vertebral body instability. The results of this study could provide a reference for surgeons when using imaging modalities to assess the degree of vertebral body collapse.Copyright © 2019 Wei-En Hsu et al.

150,"Estimation of activity of administered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose by measurement of the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is now a routine procedure for the management of cancer patients. Intravenous administration of FDG is sometimes halted due to troubles. In such cases, estimations of the FDG dosage injected prior to halting administration may be helpful. We have established a method of estimating the activity of FDG to patients on the basis of the dose equivalent rate on the surface of the right temporal region of the head. The correlation of actual administered dosage with independent variables, such as the dose equivalent rate on the right temporal region of the head, age, sex, and body weight, was analyzed using multiple regression analysis to obtain linear, quadratic, and cubic regression equations. Result(s): When entering independent variables, the cubic regression equation could be used to estimate an administered dosage with an accuracy of +/-10 % for 62 % of all patients and +/-20 % for 90 % of all patients. Conclusion(s): We conclude that this method is useful for estimating the administered dosage from the dose equivalent rate on the temporal region of the head.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded

2955,"Differential effects of genotoxic stress on both concurrent body growth and gradual senescence in the adult zebrafish Among vertebrates, fish and mammals show intriguing differences in their growth control properties with age. The potential for unlimited or indeterminate growth in a variety of fish species has prompted many questions regarding the senescent phenomena that appear during the aging process in these animals. Using zebrafish as our model system, we have attempted in our current study to examine the growth phenomena in fish in relation to the onset of senescence-associated symptoms, and to evaluate the effects of genotoxic stress on these processes. We observed in the course of these analyses that the zebrafish undergoes continuous growth, irrespective of age, past the point of sexual maturation with gradually decreasing growth rates at later stages. Animal population density, current body size and chronological age also play predominant roles in regulating zebrafish growth and all inversely influence the growth rate. Interestingly, the induction of genotoxic stress by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) did not adversely affect this body growth ability in zebrafish. However, IR was found to chronically debilitate the regeneration of amputated caudal fins and thereby induce high levels of abnormal fin regeneration in the adult zebrafish. In addition, by resembling and mimicking the natural course of aging, IR treatments likewise enhanced several other symptoms of senescence, such as a decline in reproductive abilities, increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity and a reduction in melatonin secretion. Our current data thus suggest that during the lifespan of zebrafish, the onset of senescence-associated symptoms occurs in parallel with continuous growth throughout mid-adulthood. Moreover, our present findings indicate that genotoxic DNA damage may play a role as a rate-limiting factor during the induction of senescence, but not in the inhibition of continuous, density-dependent growth in adult zebrafish.",Included

2368,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included

Factors included age, interval diagnosis of SCLC to radiotherapy (RT) of MSCC, visceral metastases, further bone metastases, gender, time developing motor deficits, pre-RT ambulatory status, number of affected vertebrae, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS)., RESULTS: Improvement of motor deficits showed significant associations with ECOG PS 1-2 (P = .018); time developing motor deficits achieved borderline significance (P = .059). Post-RT ambulatory status was significantly associated with slower development of motor dysfunction (P = .003), ambulatory status (P < .001), and ECOG PS 1-2 (P < .001). No factor was significantly associated with overall response and local control. On multivariate analysis, OS was significantly associated with interval from SCLC diagnosis to RT of MSCC (P = .004), visceral metastases (P < .001), ambulatory status (P = .002), and ECOG PS (P = .002). For the survival score, 6-month OS rates related to each of these factors were divided by 10. Patient scores were obtained by adding these factors' scores. Three groups were defined (5, 7-13, and 15-17 points) with 6-month OS rates of 0, 18%, and 77%, respectively (P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Predictors of various outcomes were identified and a survival score was created that can support physicians aiming to create personalized treatments to patients with MSCC from SCLC.

1159,"Outcomes of Radiotherapy for Osseous Echinococcosis of Meriones meridianus Background: Osseous cyst echinococcosis (CE) is an infectious disease that causes disability and deformity in patients, yet there is still no satisfactory treatment. Focusing on the feasibility and prognosis of radiotherapy as an adjuvant or palliative treatment for osseous CE, this study investigated the outcome of Meriones meridianus with osseous CE after radiotherapy., Methods: The study utilized a comparison control group design with three groups of gerbils, and 240 osseous CE gerbils were randomly divided into control, 40Gy/5times, and 50Gy/5times groups. Different doses of radiotherapy were given to the gerbils, and then, the effects of radiotherapy on gerbils and lesions were observed at 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. Statistical analysis was done using chi 2 test, unpaired t-test, and one-way ANOVA., Results: Significant changes (P < 0.05) were achieved between the three groups in terms of seven parameters at 3 and 6 months, including the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, number of dead scolices, protein content, Ca2+ concentration, the maximum diameter of lesion site, and wet weight of cysts. Except for the number of dead gerbils and lesion sites with ulceration and infection, all other parameters were observed a big difference between 3 months and 6 months in the 50Gy/5times group., Conclusion: Radiotherapy at a dose of 50 Gy has inhibitory and therapeutic effects on osseous CE in gerbils, and radiotherapy could probably be a treatment option for persistent or recurrent osseous CE.

Method(s):Patients not eligible for curative radiotherapy were randomised to receive either chemoradiation or chemotherapy alone. Four courses of intravenous carboplatin on day 1 and oral vinorelbin on days 1 and 8 were given with 3-week intervals. Patients in the chemoradiation arm also received radiotherapy with fractionation 42 Gy/15, starting at the second chemotherapy course. The primary end point was overall survival; secondary end points were health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and toxicity. Result(s):Enrolment was terminated due to slow accrual after 191 patients from 25 Norwegian hospitals were randomised. Median age was 67 years and 21% had PS 2. In the chemotherapy versus the chemoradiation arm, the median overall survival was 9.7 and 12.6 months, respectively (P<0.01). One-year survival was 34.0% and 53.2% (P<0.01). Following a minor decline during treatment, HRQOL remained unchanged in the chemoradiation arm. The patients in the chemotherapy arm reported gradual deterioration during the subsequent months. In the chemoradiation arm, there were more hospital admissions related to side effects (P<0.05). Conclusion(s):Chemoradiation was superior to chemotherapy alone with respect to survival and HRQoL at the expense of more hospital admissions due to toxicity. © 2013 Cancer Research UK.",Excluded
2271,"Innovations in applied decision theory for health and safety Objectives There are established methods for occupational epidemiological cohort analysis, such as proportional hazards regression, that are well suited to aetiological research and yield parameter estimates that allow for succinct communication among academics. However, these methods are not necessarily well suited for evaluation of health impacts of policy choices and communication to decision makers. An informed decision about a policy that impacts health and safety requires a valid estimate of the policy's potential impact. Methods We propose methods for data summarisation that may facilitate communication with managers, workers and their advocates. We calculate measures of effect in a framework for competing events, graphically display potential impacts on cause-specific mortality under policy alternatives and contrast these results to estimates obtained using standard Poisson regression methods. Methods are illustrated using a cohort mortality study of 28 546 Ontario uranium miners hired between 1950 and 1996 and followed through 2007. Results A standard regression analysis yields a positive association between cumulative radon progeny exposure and all-cause mortality (log(RR per 100 WLM)=0.09; SE=0.02). The proposed method yields an estimate of the expected gain in life expectancy (approximately 6 months per worker) and reduction of 261 lung cancer deaths under a policy that eliminated occupational radon progeny exposure. Conclusions The proposed method shifts attention from covariate-adjusted risk ratios or rate ratios to estimates of deaths that are avoided or delayed under a potential policy. The approach may help inform decision-making and strengthen the connection of epidemiological approaches to data analysis with developments in decision theory and systems engineering to improve health and safety.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

2775,"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or robotic radiosurgery (RRS) for salvage treatment of colorectal liver metastases Background. Stereotactic radiation therapy is an evolving modality to treat otherwise unresectable liver metastases. In this analysis, two local therapies: 1) single session robotic radiosurgery (RRS) and 2) percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were compared in a total of 60 heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patients. Methods. Thirty patients with a total of 35 colorectal liver metastases not qualifying for surgery that were treated in curative intent with RRS were prospectively followed. To compare efficacy of both treatment modalities, patients treated with RFA during the same period of time were matched according to number and size of the treated lesions. Local tumor control, local disease free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant recurrence (FFDR) were analyzed for efficacy. Treatment-related side effects were recorded for comparison. Results. The median diameter of the treated lesions was 33 mm (7-53 mm). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. One- and two-year local control rates showed no significant difference but favored RRS (85% vs. 65% and 80% vs. 61%, respectively). A significantly longer local DFS of patients treated with RRS compared to RFA (34.4 months vs. 6.0 months; p < 0.001) was found. Both, median FFDR (11.4 months for RRS vs. 7.1 months for RFA p = 0.25) and the recurrence rate (67% for RRS and 63% for RFA, p > 0.99) were comparable. Conclusion. Single session RRS is a safe and effective method to treat colorectal liver metastases. In this analysis, a trend towards longer DFS was seen in patients treated with RRS when compared to RFA.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
577,"Texture analysis for the assessment of structural changes in parotid glands induced by radiotherapy BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: During radiotherapy (RT) for head-and-neck cancer, parotid glands undergo significant anatomic, functional and structural changes which could characterize pre-clinical signs of an increased risk of xerostomia. Texture analysis is proposed to assess structural changes of parotids induced by RT, and to investigate whether early variations of textural parameters (such as mean intensity and fractal dimension) can predict parotid shrinkage at the end of treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Textural parameters and volumes of 42 parotids from 21 patients treated with intensity-modulated RT for nasopharyngeal cancer were extracted from CT images. To individuate which parameters changed during RT, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test between textural indices (first and second RT week; first and last RT week) was performed. Discriminant analysis was applied to variations of these parameters in the first two weeks of RT to assess their power in predicting parotid shrinkage at the end of RT., RESULTS: A significant decrease in mean intensity (1.7 HU and 3.8 HU after the second and last weeks, respectively) and fractal dimension (0.016 and 0.021) was found. Discriminant analysis, based on volume and fractal dimension, was able to predict the final parotid shrinkage (accuracy of 71.4%)., CONCLUSION: Textural features could be used in combination with volume to characterize structural modifications on parotid glands and to predict parotid shrinkage at the end of RT.

1107,"Nitric oxide treatment attenuates muscle atrophy during hind limb suspension in mice Debilitating muscle-disuse atrophy in aging or obesity has huge socioeconomic impact. Since nitric oxide (NO) mediates muscle satellite cell activation and induces hypertrophy with exercise in old mice, we tested whether treatment with the NO donor, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), during hind limb suspension would reduce atrophy. Mice were suspended 18 days, with or without daily ISDN (66 mg/kg). Muscles were examined for atrophy (weight, fiber diameter); regulatory changes in atrogin-1 (a negative regulator of muscle mass), myostatin (inhibits myogenesis), and satellite cell proliferation; and metabolic responses in myosin heavy chains (MyHCs), liver lipid, and hypothalamic gene expression. Suspension decreased muscle weight and weight relative to body weight between 25-55%, and gastrocnemius fiber diameter vs. controls. In young-adult mice, ISDN attenuated atrophy by half or more. In quadriceps, ISDN completely prevented the suspension-induced rise in atrogin-1 and drop in myostatin precursor, and attenuated the changes in MyHCs 1 and 2b observed in unloaded muscles without treatment. Fatty liver in suspended young-adult mice was also reduced by ISDN; suspended young mice had higher hypothalamic expression of the orexigenic agouti-related protein, Agrp than controls. Notably, a suspension-induced drop in muscle satellite cell proliferation by 25-58% was completely prevented (young mice) or attenuated (halved, in young-adult mice) by ISDN. NO-donor treatment has potential to attenuate atrophy and metabolic changes, and prevent regulatory changes during disuse and offset/prevent wasting in age-related sarcopenia or space travel. Increases in precursor proliferation resulting from NO treatment would also amplify benefits of physical therapy and exercise.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1608,"Effect of extracellular pH on GABA-activated current in rat recombinant receptors and thin hypothalamic slices We studied the effects of extracellular pH (pHo) on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl- current in rat hypothalamic neurons and recombinant type-A GABA (GABA(A)) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293), using whole cell and outside-out patch-clamp recordings. In alpha3beta2gamma2s receptors, acidic pH decreased, whereas alkaline pH increased the response to GABA in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner. Acidification shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right, significantly increasing the EC50 for GABA without appreciably changing the slope or maximal current induced by GABA. We obtained similar effects of pH in alpha1beta2gamma2 receptors and in GABA-activated currents recorded from thin hypothalamic brain slices. In outside-out patches recorded from alpha3beta2gamma2 recombinant receptors, membrane patches were exposed to 5 microM GABA at control (7.3), acidic (6.4), or alkaline (8.4) pH. GABA activated main and subconductance states of 24 and 16 pS, respectively, in alpha3beta2gamma2 receptors. Alkaline pH(o) increased channel opening frequency and decreased the duration of the long closed state, resulting in an increase in open probability (from 0.0801 +/- 0.015 in pH 7.3 to 0.138 +/- 0.02 in pH 8.4). Exposure of the channels to acidic pH(o) had the opposite effects on open probability (decreased to 0.006 +/- 0.0001). Taken together, our results indicate that the function of GABA(A) receptors is modulated by extracellular pH. The proton effect is similar in recombinant and native receptors and is dependent on GABA concentration. In addition, the effect appears to be independent of the alpha-subunit isoform, and is due to the ability of H+ to alter the frequency of channel opening. Our findings indicate that GABAergic signaling in the CNS may be significantly altered during conditions that increase or decrease pH.",Excluded
1041,"Computed tomography in patients with abdominal pain and diarrhoea: Does the benefit outweigh the drawbacks? The role of computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of abdominal pain is well established. However, concern exists in regard to procedure-related radiation levels, contrast-medium toxicity and costs. We sought to determine whether the use of abdominal CT caused major changes in the management of patients who had abdominal pain and diarrhoea. We reviewed all abdominal CT examinations that were performed at our hospital from October through December 2010. We selected 574 scans that had been performed in patients who presented with or without diarrhoea. We examined the selected medical records to determine whether the CT scan changed patients' management. A scan was considered to be management changing if a decisive intervention occurred on the basis of the scan results. Among 124 scans in patients with diarrhoea and 450 scans in patients without diarrhoea, the scan results changed management in 13 of the patients with diarrhoea (11%) and in 233 of those without diarrhoea (52%) (P<0.001). When management changed, the changes resulted from findings unrelated to diarrhoea. Despite its defined role in the assessment of abdominal pain, CT of patients that also had diarrhoea seldom caused a major change in management. The probability of CT causing such a change does not outweigh the cost, radiation risk or potential for contrast-induced nephropathy. © 2013 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.",Excluded
2307,"Factors associated with increased incidence of severe toxicities following yttrium-90 resin microspheres in the treatment of hepatic malignancies AIM: To further define variables associated with increased incidences of severe toxicities following administration of yttrium-90 ((90)Y) microspheres., METHODS: Fifty-eight patients undergoing 79 treatments were retrospectively assessed for development of clinical and laboratory toxicity incidence following (90)Y administration. Severe toxicity events were defined using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 and defined as grade >= 3. Univariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of different factors on the incidence of severe toxicity events. Multicollinearity was assessed for all factors with P < 0.1 using Pearson correlation matrices. All factors not excluded due to multicollinearity were included in a multivariate logistic regression model for each measurement of severe toxicity., RESULTS: Severe (grade >= 3) toxicities occurred following 21.5% of the 79 treatments included in our analysis. The most common severe laboratory toxicities were severe alkaline phosphatase (17.7%), albumin (12.7%), and total bilirubin (10.1%) toxicities. Decreased pre-treatment albumin (OR = 26.2, P = 0.010) and increased pre-treatment international normalized ratio (INR) (OR = 17.7, P = 0.048) were associated with development of severe hepatic toxicity. Increased pre-treatment aspartate aminotransferase (AST; OR = 7.4, P = 0.025) and decreased pre-treatment hemoglobin (OR = 12.5, P = 0.025) were associated with severe albumin toxicity. Increasing pre-treatment model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (OR = 1.8, P = 0.033) was associated with severe total bilirubin toxicity. Colorectal adenocarcinoma histology was associated with severe alkaline phosphatase toxicity (OR = 5.4, P = 0.043)., CONCLUSION: Clinicians should carefully consider pre-treatment albumin, INR, AST, hemoglobin, MELD, and colorectal histology when choosing appropriate candidates for (90)Y microsphere therapy.",Excluded
1570,"Do radiation-induced bystander effects correlate to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of individuals and have clinical significance? It is well known that patients can vary in their normal tissue response to radiotherapy, and this can be problematic. As a result, radiobiologists have been using in vitro models to assess variation in response and elucidate the genetic determinants of this variation. However, the clinical relevance of these models is currently unknown. In this study, blood samples from healthy controls (n 20) and colorectal carcinoma patients (n 60) were cultured in vitro to assess two radiobiological end points in parallel: intrinsic radiosensitivity assayed by chromosomal aberrations (G2 scores) and radiation-induced bystander effects assayed by viability testing. Increased intrinsic radiosensitivity was observed in colorectal carcinoma donors (55) compared to the healthy donors (5) (P < 0.005). Similarly, more pronounced radiation-induced bystander effects were observed in the colorectal carcinoma donors compared to the healthy donors after 24 h exposure but not after 96 h exposure to donor irradiated cell conditioned medium (ICCM) (P < 0.05). All scores were tested for correlation with the age, sex and clinical stage of the colorectal carcinoma patients. The only statistically significant correlation was found in samples from severe Dukes D patients (P < 0.005), which had low/radioresistant G2 scores. No correlation was found between radiation-induced intrinsic sensitivity and bystander effects, which suggests that they may have separate underlying molecular mechanisms, but they both show clinical relevance in individual patient samples. © 2009 The Radiation Research Society.",Included
669,"Helicobacter gastritis induces changes in the oxyntic mucosa indistinguishable from the effects of proton pump inhibitors A causal relationship between oxyntic glands dilatation with protruding parietal cells, referred to as proton pump inhibitor (PPI) effects, and PPI use has been suspected but not established. We designed this study to evaluate the association between these changes and the use of PPIs and histamine 2-receptor blockers (H2-blockers). We obtained five Sydney System-compliant biopsy specimens from patients recruited into a therapeutic trial for H. pylori. Medication history with details on PPI and H 2-blockers use was collected. Two blinded pathologists graded gastritis and the intensity of putative PPI effects using a 0 to 3 scale. PPI and H2-blocker use was then disclosed and the accuracy of pathologists' assessment was analyzed. There were 138 H. pylori-negative and 104 positive patients. In H. pylori-negative patients the histologic assessment for PPI use had 77.5% sensitivity and 51.8% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 86.9% and a negative predictive value of 35.9%. In H. pylori-positive patients, sensitivity was 74.1% and specificity 26.1%. Positive and negative predictive values were 55.8% and 44.4%, respectively. Neither glandular dilatations nor parietal cell protrusions related to H2-blocker use. We conclude that these changes are associated with PPI use only in H. pylori-negative subjects. In H. pylori gastritis, so-called PPI-effects were equally prevalent in PPI-users and non-users, indicating that other factors are involved in the induction of oxyntic cell hyperplasia. We suggest that comments regarding the supposed evidence of PPI use are too often wrong to be useful and should be avoided in the diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

990,"The value of the initial post-EVAR computed tomography angiography scan in predicting future secondary procedures using the Powerlink stent graft Objective: Current long-term surveillance after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) is based on high-resolution contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans at scheduled, lifelong intervals. The cancer and nephrotoxicity risks of interval CT scanning and prolonged radiation exposure are concerning. We sought to determine if surveillance CT angiography (CTA) can be safely reduced. Method(s): From July 2000 to November 2007, 345 patients were enrolled in U.S. Food and Drug Administration trials of the Powerlink System (Endologix, Irvine, Calif). An independent core laboratory analyzed 1519 post-EVAR CT scans (N = 1519) to 5 years to evaluate aneurysm size, migration, presence of endoleak, and evidence of graft obstruction. Analyses were conducted to determine the value of the initial CTA scan in predicting future secondary procedures in enrolled patients. Result(s): At any time during follow-up, CTA identified endoleak in 123 patients (36%), with 95% of endoleaks being type II. In addition, 49 patients underwent 72 secondary procedures at a mean of 22 +/- 21 months (range, 2-2007 days) after initial EVAR. These were based on clinical identification of limb ischemia in 13 interventions (18%) or core laboratory identification of abnormal CT finding in 58 interventions (81%). Of the 58 core laboratory identified findings, the inciting abnormality was present on the initial postoperative scan in 49 (84%). Of the remaining nine CT-driven procedures, three (5.2%) were due to late sac expansion attributed to type II endoleak (n= 2) or endotension (n= 1); two (3.4%) were for prophylactic reasons in the absence of endoleak; and four (6.8%) were in patients with type II endoleak not observed by the core laboratory and without sac expansion. The negative predictive value of the initial postoperative CTA for the need for a secondary procedure is therefore 96.4%, which can be improved to 97.6% with duplex ultrasound surveillance to detect sac expansion. Thus, a negative initial postoperative CTA is highly predictive of long-term freedom from secondary intervention. Conclusion(s): Among enrolled patients with suitable anatomy for EVAR, most abnormalities that result in a secondary procedure are detected on the initial postoperative CTA or present with clinical symptoms. Long-term surveillance CTA may therefore be replaced by duplex ultrasound imaging if the initial postoperative CTA shows no abnormalities.

2103,"Differential radio-adaptive responses in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice: pivotal role of calcium and nitric oxide signalling Purpose: Our earlier studies demonstrated that transient radio-adaptive responses (RAR) in BALB/c mice were due to MAPK hyperactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the time duration of this low dose induced MAPK activation in BALB/c mice and to find out if similar adaptive responses are observed in C57BL/6 mice. Materials and methods: Mice were irradiated with 0.1 Gy priming dose (PD), 2 Gy challenge dose (CD) with an interval of 4 h (P + CD) and radiation induced immunosuppression in splenic lymphocytes was monitored as the endpoint for RAR. Results: Time kinetics following 0.1 Gy demonstrated persistence of MAPK hyperactivation till 48 h. Similar experiments in C57BL/6 mice indicated absence of RAR at 24 h following CD, in spite of MAPK activation which was also confirmed by time kinetics. Therefore, upstream activators of MAPK, viz., reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) and calcium levels were estimated. There was increased intracellular calcium (Ca2+) and nitric oxide (NO) in BALB/c and an increase in intracellular ROS in C57BL/6 mice 24 h after PD. Inhibition of NO and calcium chelation abrogated RAR in BALB/c mice. In vitro treatment of spleen cells with combination of NO donor and Ca2+ ionophore mimicked the effect of PD and induced adaptive response after 2 Gy not only in BALB/c but also in C57BL/6 mice confirming their crucial role in RAR. Conclusions: These results suggest that low dose induced differential induction of Ca2+ and NO signaling along with MAPK was responsible for contrasting RAR with respect to immune system of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice.

2421,"Interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus does delayed surgery have an impact on outcome? Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) affects postoperative outcomes in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thoracic esophagus. Background(s): Esophagectomy is usually recommended within 4 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant CRT. However, the optimal timing of surgery is not clearly defined. Method(s): A total of 129 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, treated between 1998 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of timing to surgery: group 1, <=30 days (n = 17); group 2, 31 to 60 days (n = 83); and group 3, 61 to 90 days (n = 29). Subsequently, only 2-numerically more consistent-groups were studied, using the median value of timing intervals as a cutoff level: group A, <=46 days (n = 66); and group B, <46 days (n = 63). Result(s): Groups were comparable in terms of patient and tumor characteristics, type of neoadjuvant regimen, toxicity, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, tumor downstaging, and pathologic complete responses. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0% in group 1, 43.1% in group 2, and 35.9% in group 3 (P = 0.13). After R0 resection (n = 106), the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0%, 51%, and 47.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). Tumor recurrence after R0 resection seemed to be inversely related, even if not significantly (P = 0.17), to the time interval between chemoradiation and surgery: 50% in group 1, 40.6% in group 2, and 21.7% in group 3. When considering only 2 groups, the overall 5-year survival was 33.1% in group A and 42.7% in group B (P = 0.64); after R0 resection, the 5-year survival was 37.8% and 56.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). The rate of tumor recurrence was significantly lower in group B (25%) than in group A (48.3%) (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not compromise the outcomes of patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. Delaying surgery up to 90 days offers relevant advantages in the clinical management of the patients, can reduce tumor recurrences, and may improve prognosis after complete R0 resection surgery.

2712,"Altered proliferation and differentiation of human epidermis in cases of skin fibrosis after radiotherapy PURPOSE: To characterize, at the histopathologic and molecular levels, the irradiated epidermis in cases of human skin fibrosis induced by radiotherapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Surgical samples were obtained from 6 patients who had developed cutaneous fibronecrotic lesions from 7 months to 27 years after irradiation. The proliferation and differentiation status of the irradiated epidermis was characterized with specific markers using immunohistochemical methods., RESULTS: All samples presented with hyperplasia of the epidermis associated with local inflammation. The scar epidermis exhibited an increased expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which revealed hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Furthermore, an abnormal differentiation was found, characterized by the expression of K6 and K16, and by alterations in protein amounts and localization of cytokeratins, involucrin, and transforming growth factor-beta1., CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that late damage of irradiated skin is not only characterized by fibrosis in the dermis but also by hyperplasia in the epidermis. This hyperplasia was due to both hyperproliferation and abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes.",Excluded

A hand-held gamma-detecting probe was used during operation to determine whether gross tumor accumulated the radiolabeled analog and occult tumor could be detected. Positive uptake was defined as tumor/background ratios exceeding 2:1., RESULTS: The tumor in all seven patients with gross disease accumulated 125I-TYR(3)-octreotide. Occult tumor beyond that appreciated with preoperative imaging or by routine operative exploration was detected in a patient with carcinoid tumor. In the patient with the occult gastrinoma the probe detected the lesion within the duodenal bulb before duodenotomy and also predicted what proved histologically to be positive peripancreatic adenopathy. There was a single false-positive reading from the stomach in a patient with suspected carcinoid tumor in whom no tumor could be found grossly or histologically. A pancreatic mass that probed negative proved to be an adenocarcinoma of ductal origin., CONCLUSIONS: Tumor-specific peptide-receptor binding can be detected in situ with 125J-TYR(3)-octreotide and a hand-held gamma-detecting probe. This technique may facilitate neuroendocrine tumor localization and operative cytoreduction.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Between 2001 and 2004, 50 patients with stage III/IV SCCHN (0 to 2 performance status) were enrolled into this study. The capecitabine dose was between 450 and 550mg/m2 twice daily, continuously for 28 days. The radiotherapy dose was 5500cGy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. No intensity-modulated radiation was used. We evaluated the complete response rate, toxicity, locoregional control, overall survival, disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival. Result(s): The median age was 55 (range 38-76) years; 72% had stage IV disease. The median follow-up was 6 years on the 30 surviving patients. Eighty-two per cent of patients completed the course of capecitabine and 94% completed prescribed radiotherapy. There were no treatment-related deaths, grade 3/4 haematological or renal toxicity. Five patients developed drug-related grade 3/4 acute toxicity (cardiac, skin, bowel); 47 developed grade 3/4 mucositis from chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two (44%) patients required tube feeding and the tube dependency rate at 1 year was 6%. The complete response rate at 3 months was 90% (45/50 patients). Relapse occurred in 17/50 (34%) patients by 5 years. The locoregional control, overall survival, cancer-specific survival and disease-free survival rates at 3 years were 78, 72, 82 and 62%, respectively, and at 5 years were 72, 64, 75 and 56%, respectively. Conclusion(s): This schedule of synchronous capecitabine for locally advanced SCCHN is well tolerated. The local control in this series compares favourably with other synchronous chemoradiotherapy reports. Chronic dysphagia and tube dependence is uncommon with this approach. Capecitabine as targeted therapy given with each fraction of radiotherapy and administered orally may have significant advantages over intravenous, 3 weekly cisplatin. © 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded
1248,"Outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for foramen magnum meningiomas: an international multicenter study OBJECTIVE Meningiomas are the most common benign extramedullary lesions of the foramen magnum; however, their optimal management remains undefined. Given their location, foramen magnum meningiomas (FMMs) can cause significant morbidity, and complete microsurgical removal can be challenging. Anterior and anterolateral FMMs carry greater risks with surgery, but they comprise the majority of these lesions. As an alternative to resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been used to treat FMMs in small case series. To more clearly define the outcomes of SRS and to delineate a rational management paradigm for these lesions, the authors analyzed the safety and efficacy of SRS for FMM in an international multicenter trial. METHODS Seven medical centers participating in the International Gamma Knife Research Foundation (IGKRF) provided data for this retrospective cohort study. Patients who were treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery and whose clinical and radiological follow-up was longer than 6 months were eligible for study inclusion. Data from pre- and post-SRS radiological and clinical evaluations were analyzed. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment variables were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients (39 females and 18 males, with a median age of 64 years) met the study inclusion criteria. Thirty-two percent had undergone prior microsurgical resection. Patients most frequently presented with cranial neuropathy (39%), headache (35%), numbness (32%), and ataxia (30%). Median pre-SRS tumor volume was 2.9 cm3. Median SRS margin dose was 12.5 Gy (range 10-16 Gy). At the last follow-up after SRS, 49% of tumors were stable, 44% had regressed, and 7% had progressed. Progression-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were each 92%. A greater margin dose was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of tumor regression, with 53% of tumors treated with > 12 Gy regressing. Fifty-two percent of symptomatic patients noted some clinical improvement. Adverse radiation effects were limited to hearing loss and numbness in 1 patient (2%). CONCLUSIONS Stereotactic radiosurgery for FMM frequently results in tumor control or tumor regression, as well as symptom improvement. Margin doses > 12 Gy were associated with increased rates of tumor regression. Stereotactic radiosurgery was generally safe and well tolerated. Given its risk-benefit profile, SRS may be particularly useful in the management of small- to moderate-volume anterior and anterolateral FMMs.",Excluded
1693,"Effects of NKG2D haplotypes on the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on natural killer and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among atomic-bomb survivors NKG2D is a primary activating receptor that triggers cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NK cells against tumor and virus-infected cells. We previously identified the NKG2D haplotypes in the natural killer gene complex region on chromosome 12p. Two major haplotype alleles, LNK1 and HNK1, were closely related to low and high natural cytotoxic activity phenotypes, respectively. Furthermore, the haplotype of HNK1/HNK1 has revealed a decreased risk of cancer compared with LNK1/LNK1. In the present study, using flow cytometry, we evaluated the functional effects of NKG2D haplotypes and five htSNPs in terms of the cell-surface expression of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells of peripheral blood among 732 atomic-bomb survivors. NKG2D expression on NK cells showed significant increases, in the order of LNK1/LNK1, LNK1/HNK1 and HNK1/HNK1 haplotypes (p for trend = 0.003), or with major homozygous, heterozygous, and minor homozygous genotypes for individual htSNPs (p for trend = 0.02-0.003). The same trend was observed for NKG2D expression on CD8 T cells. Our findings indicate that the NKG2D haplotypes are associated with the expression levels of NKG2D protein on NK and CD8 T cells, resulting in inter-individual variations in human cytotoxic response. © 2012 American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics.",Included
1758,"Which is the preferred modality of renal access for a trainee urologist: Ultrasonography or fluoroscopy? results of a prospective randomized trial Background and Purpose: In percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), placement of the access tract into the kidney is an important aspect of the procedure and is responsible for the steep learning curve associated with the operation. The aim of the current prospective randomized trial was to assess the duration of radiation exposure along with the safety and efficacy of PCNL done by a trainee, utilizing either ultrasonography (US) or fluoroscopic guidance to obtain access., Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with <=3cm renal calculi undergoing single-tract PCNL by trainee urologists (experience of <25 PCNL's) were randomized into US-and fluoroscopic-guided access groups (32 in each). In Group 1 (US guided), puncture was done using a 3.5/5MHz US probe with a puncture attachment, whereas the triangulation technique with biplanar C-arm fluoroscopy was utilized in group 2 (fluoroscopic guided). Patient demographics, stone parameters, intraoperative characteristics, fluoroscopy durations, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed., Results: Both groups were comparable as far as patient and stone characteristics were concerned. The fluoroscopy exposure during the puncture phase (T2) and overall (T) was significantly lower in the US group at 9.0+/-20.8 vs 43.8+/-34.8, (p<0.0001) and 204.3+/-84 vs 239.9+/-77.5, (p=0.04). Six patients in group1 required fluoroscopic adjustment (p=0.03). All other intra-and postoperative parameters were similar in both the groups. Conclusion(s): Both ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for renal access are equally safe and feasible in the hands of a trainee urologist. Total fluoroscopy duration and exposure time during puncture were both significantly less in the ultrasound group. Expertise in fluoroscopic-guided access is essential for a novice to effectively achieve access in all possible situations.Copyright © 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
807,"Reanalysis of Hanford data: 1944-1986 deaths Reanalysis of Hanford data by a method, which is new only in the sense that it makes new uses of standard epidemiological procedures, has produced evidence of a cancer risk at low dose levels. By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded
1848,"Mitigation of hematologic radiation toxicity in mice through pharmacological quiescence induced by CDK4/6 inhibition Total body irradiation (TBI) can induce lethal myelosuppression, due to the sensitivity of proliferating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to ionizing radiation (IR). No effective therapy exists to mitigate the hematologic toxicities of TBI. Here, using selective and structurally distinct small molecule inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6, we have demonstrated that selective cellular quiescence increases radioresistance of human cell lines in vitro and mice in vivo. Cell lines dependent on CDK4/6 were resistant to IR and other DNA-damaging agents when treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. In contrast, CDK4/6 inhibitors did not protect cell lines that proliferated independently of CDK4/6 activity. Treatment of wild-type mice with CDK4/6 inhibitors induced reversible pharmacological quiescence (PQ) of early HSPCs but not most other cycling cells in the bone marrow or other tissues. Selective PQ of HSPCs decreased the hematopoietic toxicity of TBI, even when the CDK4/6 inhibitor was administered several hours after TBI. Moreover, PQ at the time of administration of therapeutic IR to mice harboring autochthonous cancers reduced treatment toxicity without compromising the therapeutic tumor response. These results demonstrate an effective method to mitigate the hematopoietic toxicity of IR in mammals, which may be potentially useful after radiological disaster or as an adjuvant to anticancer therapy.",Excluded
21,"Effects of laser irradiation on arthritic histopathology and heat shock protein 70 expression in C57 black mice with osteoarthritis OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of three different laser treatments (650 nm alone, 10.6 mum alone and combined laser of 650 nm and 10.6 mum) on experimental osteoarthritis of the knees in C57 black mice., METHODS: Sixty C57 black mice were divided randomly into 6 groups. Ten mice were assigned to a normal control group (no intervention) and the other 5 groups were subjected to a forced running regimen to induce osteoarthritis. One group was set as the model control group. The other 4 groups were given 90 s of a 650 nm laser, 90 s of a 10.6 mum laser, 90 s of a combined laser, or a sham treatment on acupoint Dubi (ST35) of the rear left leg 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The modified Mankin score was used to evaluate the degree of cartilage degradation. Immunohistochemical staining for heat shock protein (HSP) 70 was conducted., RESULTS: Mankin scores of the model control group and the sham control group were significantly higher than that of the normal control group (P<0.01). Mankin score of the combined laser group was significantly lower than that of the model control group (P<0.01). Compared with the normal control group, there was a significant induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes of the combined laser group., CONCLUSION: The arthritic cartilage induced in C57 black mice improved significantly after combined laser treatment of 650 nm and 10.6 mum lasers. This effect may be related to the induction of HSP70 in the arthritic chondrocytes. The two different lasers appear to have a synergistic effect.",Excluded

1356,"Low-dose radiotherapy for lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa Purpose: There is no agreement within the radiation oncology and ophthalmic communities regarding the treatment of lymphoid lesions of the orbit and ocular adnexa. The authors report their experience with the use of low-dose radiation therapy for malignant and benign lymphoid masses of the orbital region in a series of 54 patients treated between 1985 and 1993. Method(s): All patients received 2 Gy per day for a total of 24 Gy, except when the lesion was extensive, in which case the therapy was 1.5 Gy per day for a total of 25.5 Gy. A diagnosis was established by incisional surgical biopsy in 26 patients and aspiration cytology in 28 patients. Those with a malignant or an indeterminate diagnosis were evaluated with a modified Ann Arbor staging system. Result(s): Low-dose radiation therapy produced a complete response in 100% of the orbital lymphoid lesions. This local control was maintained in 52 patients (96%) for the first year and in 51 patients (95%) for 5 or more years with a mean follow-up of 7 years. One patient died of causes unrelated to the malignant lymphoma after the first year of observation. The mean age of the 54 patients was 67 years, and the range was 37 to 90 years. The mean ages of presentation for each location were: orbit, 67 years; conjunctiva, 68 years; lacrimal gland, 66 years; and eyelids, 72 years. The female-to-male ratio was 1.25:1 (34 women and 20 men). In this series, 9 patients had benign processes, 38 patients had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 patients had abnormalities of indeterminate cause. All histologic subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the orbit responded equally well to therapy. Forty-five patients had clinically staged disease as follows: stage I, 21 patients; stage II, 4 patients; stage III, 2 patients; and stage IV, 18 patients. Benign disease, diagnosed in 9 patients, was not staged. Conclusion(s): Low-dose radiation therapy proved effective in treating lymphoid lesions of the orbital area. No treatment-limiting complications occurred. The only early side effects were mild xerophthalmia and chemosis in 50% of patients, and the only chronic side effect was mild xerophthalmia in 33% of patients.

The aim of this study is to compare prospectively in a single, high-volume center the outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ablation performed specifically by second-generation cryoballoon or contact force radiofrequency ablation., METHODS: Consecutive patients scheduled for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation have been included and prospectively followed up. Aiming to reduce potential bias deriving from baseline characteristics, a propensity score matching analysis has been performed to analyze safety and efficacy outcomes., RESULTS: Out of consecutive patients undergoing atrial fibrillation transcatheter ablation between January 2015 and December 2016, 46 patients approached by cryoablation were matched 1 : 1 by propensity score to a similar population treated by last-generation radiofrequency ablation. Freedom from atrial fibrillation after 12 months (76 vs. 78%, P = 0.804) and incidence of complications (4 vs. 6%, P = 0.168) did not differ between the two groups. Radiological exposure was higher for the cryoballoon group (11 vs. 4 min, P < 0.001), whereas procedural duration did not differ (P = 0.174). Aiming to assess the potential impact of a learning curve in patients undergoing cryoablation, the first-third of patients (n = 15) were compared with the remaining, reporting longer radiological exposure (P < 0.001), but similar safety and efficacy., CONCLUSION: In this propensity score analysis, last-generation cryoballoon and radiofrequency catheters for atrial fibrillation ablation present similar efficacy and safety.

Patients A total of 265 consecutive patients with toxic nodular goitre were treated between March 2003 and August 2004 at our institute and followed up for a maximum of 8 years. Preliminary radioiodine testing with volumetric measurement of the thyroid by ultrasound as well as individual thyroidal radioiodine uptake and half-life measurements were performed before radioiodine therapy. The estimated radiation dose to the thyroid was 150 Gy. Measurements Follow-up controls with respect to success of therapy and development of hypothyroidism were performed 3 months, 1 and up to 8 years after radioiodine treatment. The relation of the achieved thyroid dose to the success rate of treatment and to the incidence of hypothyroidism was analysed. Results The cure rates were 85% at 3 months, 98% at 1 year and 98% at the end of follow-up. Above an achieved thyroid dose of more than 120 Gy, there was no significant association between the dose achieved in the thyroid and the cure rate on follow-up. The incidences of hypothyroidism at 3 months, at 1 year and at the end of follow-up were 32%, 55% and 73%, respectively. Conclusions Radioiodine treatment with a calculated dose regimen is a highly effective treatment option in patients with toxic goitre with an overall success rate of 98%. However, radioiodine treatment with an intended thyroid dose of 150 Gy leads to a high incidence of hypothyroidism on long-term follow-up. This finding supports the suggestion that in future intended thyroid doses could be lowered in patients treated with a calculated dose regimen for toxic nodular goitre. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Excluded
1500,"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy of rectal carcinoma: Baseline hematologic parameters influencing outcomes Background: The link between the blood count and a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is indisputable and well described. Pretreatment hematological parameters may predict the overall clinical outcomes in many types of cancer. Thus, this study aims to systematically evaluate the relationship between baseline blood count levels and treatment response in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients and Methods: From 2009-2015, 173 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were retrospectively enrolled in the study and analyzed. The baseline blood count was recorded in all patients 1 week before chemoradiation. Tumor response was evaluated through pathologic findings. Blood count levels which included RBC (red blood cells), Hb (hemoglobin), PLT (platelet count), neutrophil count, WBC (white blood cells), NLR (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), and PLR (platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) were analyzed in relation to tumor downstaging, pCR (pathologic complete response), OS (overall survival), and DFS (disease-free survival). Result(s): Hb levels were associated with a response in logistic regression analysis: pCR (p = 0.05; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07); T downstaging (p = 0.006; OR 1.03, 95 % CI 1.01-1.05); N downstaging (p = 0.09; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); T or N downstaging (p = 0.007; OR 1.04, 95 % CI 1.01-1.07); T and N downstaging (p = 0.02; OR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.00-1.04); Hb and RBC were the most significant parameters influencing OS; PLT was a negative prognostic factor for OS and DFS (p = 0.008 for OS); an NLR value of 2.8 was associated with the greatest significance for OS (p = 0.03) and primary tumor downstaging (p = 0.02).

1926,"High pathological response rate in locally advanced esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant combined modality therapy: Dose finding of a weekly chemotherapy schedule with protracted venous infusion of 5-fluorouracil and dose escalation of cisplatin, docetaxel and concurrent radiotherapy Background: This phase I study was aimed at defining the toxicity profile and pathological response rate of a neoadjuvant schedule including weekly docetaxel and cisplatin, protracted venous infusion (PVI) of 5-FU and concomitant radiotherapy (RT) in locally advanced esophageal cancer. Patients and Methods: The schedule consisted of a first phase of chemotherapy alone and a second phase of concurrent chemoradiation. Initial doses were: docetaxel and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36 and 43 plus 5-FU 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 29-49; RT (40 Gy) started on day 29. In the following steps the doses were escalated up to docetaxel 35 mg/m2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, 50 and 57 plus 5-FU 180 mg/m2 PVI on days 1-21 and 150 mg/m2 PVI on days 29-63 concurrently with RT 50 Gy. Result(s): Forty-seven patients were enrolled and 46 completed the planned treatment. During the concomitant phase, grade 3-4 hematological toxicities occurred in three patients (6.5%) (or 3/174 cycles) and non-hematological toxicities in six patients (13%) (or 7/179 cycles). A pathological downstaging was obtained in 59.6% of the cases (28/47): complete remission (pCR) in 14 patients, near pCR (residual microfoci on the primary pN0) in eight patients, pT2 pN0 in three patients and partial response on the primary with positive lymph nodes in three patients. Six (13%) and 13 (28%) patients were considered stable and non-responders, respectively. In the last dose level, eight pCR and four near-pCR were obtained out of 15 patients. The maximum tolerable dose was not formally defined because dose escalation was stopped at the last dose level. Conclusion(s): This schedule represents a feasible treatment and the high pathological response rate is extremely encouraging; the doses found in the last dose-level are the basis for an ongoing phase II study at our institution. © 2005 European Society for Medical Oncology.",Excluded
1512,"A single-center pilot study for radiosensitization of everolimus with external beam radiotherapy for the treatment of metastatic neuroendocrine liver metastasis Background: Liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NELM) are common. Given the benefit of everolimus (E) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors and its additive effect to radiotherapy (RT) in other histologies, this study evaluated safety and efficacy of concurrent E with RT for NELM. Method(s): Prospective study of 14 patients with <4 NELM, progressing on standard therapy, treated with E for 28 days prior to, concurrent with, and 14 days following RT. A safety run-in of 2 patients at E 2.5 mg daily, then 5 mg daily were completed prior to treating 10 patients with 7.5 mg daily. RTwas delivered using either conventional radiation (cRT) 30 Gy in 10 fractions or stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) 35-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions. Per lesion response was evaluated per RECIST v1.1, and toxicity per the CTCAE v4.03. Result(s): 40 NELM were treated in 14 patients (7 male and 7 female), with a median age of 63 (47-88). Primaries included lung (4), small bowel (6), colorectal (3) and renal (1); Gr.I/typical lung (4) and Gr.II/atypical lung (10). Median radiation dose delivered (BED10) was 72 Gy (range 39-180). The overall response rate (ORR) was 33%; no patients developed progression at a treated NELM in the 12 month follow-up period. Median change in size per metastasis was -23%(-100% to 7%). 1 patient developed pseudoprogression. Median time to best response was 9 months. One patient at the 7.5mg dose discontinued E post-RT due to Grade 2 thrombocytopenia, and one patient at the 7.5 mg dose had Grade 3 hypertension which resolved after completing E. Conclusion(s): Concurrent E and liver RT is safe. No patients developed progression of their treated NELM in the 12 months post treatment; further follow-up is required to determine long-term control. Combination E and RT may be an option for patients with low-volume NELM; further investigation is warranted for this promising approach.",Excluded
1605,"EUS-guided portal pressure gradient measurement with a simple novel device: a human pilot study Background and Aims Portal hypertension (PH) is a serious adverse event of liver cirrhosis. The hepatic venous pressure gradient or portal pressure gradient (PPG) accurately reflects the degree of PH and is the single best prognostic indicator in liver disease. This is usually obtained by interventional radiology (IR), although it is not routinely performed. Recently, we developed a simple novel technique for EUS-guided PPG measurement (PPGM). Our animal studies showed excellent correlation between EUS-PPGM and IR-PPGM. We present the first human pilot study of EUS-PPGM in patients with liver disease. Methods EUS-PPGM was performed by experienced endosonographers using a linear echoendoscope, a 25-gauge fine-needle aspiration needle, and a novel compact manometer. The portal vein and hepatic vein (or inferior vena cava) were targeted using a transgastric-transduodenal approach. Clinical parameters of PH were evaluated in each patient. Feasibility was defined as successful PPGM in each patient. Safety was based on adverse events captured in a postprocedural interview. Results Twenty-eight patients underwent EUS-PPGM with 100% technical success and no adverse events. PPG ranged from 1.5 to 19 mm Hg and had excellent correlation with clinical parameters of portal hypertension including the presence of varices (P = .0002), PH gastropathy (P = .007), and thrombocytopenia (P = .036). PPG was increased in patients with high clinical evidence of cirrhosis (P = .005). Conclusion This novel technique of EUS-PPGM using a 25-gauge needle and compact manometer is feasible and appears safe. Given the availability of EUS and the simplicity of the manometry setup, EUS-guided PPG may represent a promising breakthrough for procuring indispensable information in the management of patients with liver disease.Copyright © 2017",Excluded

We report the treatment outcomes, adverse events (AEs), and dosimetric parameters in local-regional advanced (LRA) HNSCC patients treated with the WF S-IMRT technique., METHODS: The IRB approved this retrospective study. Patients received WF S-IMRT with or without concomitant chemotherapy. Three separate IMRT plans corresponding to 3 planning target volumes were generated. This study reports patient and tumor characteristics, treatment-induced acute AEs based on CTCAE version 3.0, chronic AEs according to RTOG scale and treatment outcomes, local-regional control (LRC), distant metastases (DM), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS)., RESULTS: Between January 2003 and December 2010, 103 patients with LRA HNSCC were treated either definitively or postoperatively with WF S-IMRT, with (99 patients) or without (4 patients) concurrent chemotherapy. The median age was 55 years (range, 30 to 89 y). The median cumulative target dose was 70 Gy (range, 60 to 75 Gy). At a median follow-up of 40 months (range, 4 to 95 mo), the 2- and 5-year rates of OS were 94% and 77%, RFS were 90% and 84%, LRC were 97% and 93%, and DM were 9% and 11%, respectively. Grade 3 acute AEs included mucositis (68%), dysphagia (35%), weight loss (19.6%), and xerostomia (7.8%). Chronic worst grade 3 AEs included xerostomia (21.9%), weight loss (12.8%), and dysphagia (12.5%).

1656,"Growth factor treatment prior to low-dose total body irradiation increases donor cell engraftment after bone marrow transplantation in mice Low-toxicity conditioning regimens prior to bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are widely explored. We developed a new protocol using hematopoietic growth factors prior to low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in recipients of autologous transplants to establish high levels of long-term donor cell engraftment. We hypothesized that treatment of recipient mice with growth factors would selectively deplete stem cells, resulting in successful long-term donor cell engraftment after transplantation. Recipient mice were treated for 1 or 7 days with growth factors (stem cell factor [SCF] plus interleukin 11 [IL-11], SCF plus Flt-3 ligand [FL], or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]) prior to low-dose TBI (4 Gy). Donor cell chimerism was measured after transplantation of congenic bone marrow cells. High levels of donor cell engraftment were observed in recipients pretreated for 7 days with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. Although 1-day pretreatments with these cytokines initially resulted in reduced donor cell engraftment, a continuous increase in time was observed, finally resulting in highly significantly increased levels of donor cell contribution. In contrast, G-CSF treatment showed no beneficial effects on long-term engraftment. In vitro stem cell assays demonstrated the effect of cytokine treatment on stem cell numbers. Donor cell engraftment and number of remaining recipient stem cells after TBI were strongly inversely correlated, except for groups treated for 1 day with SCF plus IL-11 or SCF plus FL. We conclude that long-term donor cell engraftment can be strongly augmented by treatment of recipient mice prior to low-dose TBI with hematopoietic growth factors that act on primitive cells.",Excluded
30,"Evaluation of a transparent perfluorodecalin-infused patch as an adjunct to laser-assisted tattoo removal: A pivotal trial BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Laser-assisted treatment of tattoos is well recognized to produce opaque epidermal whitening that prevents multiple sequential passes during a single treatment session. The amount of epidermal whitening produced in association with the procedure can be minimized by topical application of perfluorodecalin (PFD), which is an optical clearing agent. This pivotal trial assessed the ability of a transparent PFD-infused patch used in conjunction with a Q-switched nanosecond laser in the treatment of tattoos to permit multiple laser passes during a single 5 minute treatment session in comparison to the number of passes that could be completed using conventional treatment of the tattoo with the laser alone., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty subjects (mean age 37 years; 14 males) with predominantly dark blue or black tattoos were enrolled in a split-tattoo trial. One half of each tattoo was treated conventionally, whereas the other half was treated through the PFD patch. Treatments were performed using a nanosecond Q-switched 755-nm Alexandrite laser. The number of treatments performed in a 5-minute time period was quantified for each side of the tattoo (primary effectiveness outcome). Patient-reported pain scores and adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated., RESULTS: Significantly more laser passes could be made on average using the PFD patch compared with treatment using the laser alone (3.7 passes vs. 1.4 passes; P < 0.001). AEs were limited to those expected during laser removal of tattoos. The proportions of subjects with transient edema and erythema were lower in the PFD patch treatment group (36.7% vs. 63.3% and 33.3% vs. 70.0%, respectively); all AEs were transient and resolved quickly. No patient in either group exhibited dyschromia (hypo- or hyperpigmentation) in the treatment area at the 1-month post treatment visit. Additionally, when surveyed at the 1-month follow-up visit, all subjects (30/30) preferred to continue laser-assisted tattoo removal with the PFD patch., CONCLUSION: An average of 3.7 laser passes were made in a defined 5-minute treatment session when using the transparent PFD-infused patch, which is significantly more than was possible with the laser alone (average of 1.4 passes). Use of the PFD patch was associated with improved tolerability compared with conventional treatment, with subjects experiencing fewer and less severe AEs related to epidermal injury. Lasers Surg.

Ageing leads to decrease of cathepsins activity in rat liver lysosomal fractions. Constant light and darkness conditions result in earlier age decline of cathepsins activity. Absence of day and night succession in comparison with alternating light conditions causes decline of both general and specific cathepsin D activity. Melatonin and epithalon administration resulted in decrease of cathepsin D activity in liver only under control interchangeable light conditions.

2874,"Effects of proton pump inhibitor use on the esophageal microbial community Background: Changes in the esophageal microbiome correlate with esophageal disease, but the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are incompletely characterized. Our objective was to identify the effects of PPI use on the microbial community of the esophagus. Method(s): Mucosal biopsies of the distal esophagus were analyzed using a customized esophageal microbiome qPCR panel array (EMB). Patient demographics, use of PPIs, duration of use and dose were recorded. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients were included. Mean age was 60.5 years. Ninety percent (52/58) of patients were on PPIs. Mean dose was 42.7 mg. Mean duration of use was 2.5 years. The use of PPIs led to a significant difference in absolute levels of only one organism, Actinomyces, in the entire array (p < 0.01). Among patients who used proton pump inhibitors, there was no significant association between dose and absolute levels of any organism. Similarly, there was no association between duration of use and absolute levels of any organism. Conclusion(s): PPI use does not seem to cause significant changes in the distal esophageal microbial community. Future studies with larger sample sizes and esophageal pH testing should be performed to determine the level of acidity and its relationship to the microbial community.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded

The results of primary examination of the personnel who professionally contact the ionizing radiation (IR) from external sources and incorporated 239Pu showed that clinical symptoms of dysfunction of the immune system manifested themselves with a frequency of 75.30%. Infectious-inflammatory diseases (46.95%) and the combined pathology of infectious and allergic character (20.12%) were the most widespread. The allergic diseases (AD) without manifestations of an infectious component were observed not often (7.62%). The monitoring which was carried out for 10 years revealed a decrease in a percentage of persons with clinical signs of disorders of the immune system up to 60.68% among the personnel at the Chemical-Steel Plant and even more among the whole group of the studied personnel at SChP--49.68% (389 : 783). Among the population their frequency made up 51.78%. Features of clinical manifestations of dysfunction ofthe immune system depending on accumulation of 239Pu in the organism are established.

AD frequency reliably increased .when the activity of 239Pu is 20 nCi, but if accumulation is higher than 20-40 nCi it decreases and again increases when the activity is over 40 nCi. Pathologies of infectious and allergic genesis are most often observed when the content of 239Pu in an organism is over 40 nCi. Indicators of the immune status (IS) of the personnel at SChP with incorporated 239Pu are analyzed. 59 people--carriers of 239Pu and 408 people without 239Pu accumulated in an organism are examined. In comparison with the control, IS indicators characteristic for all dose loading groups are revealed: increase of lymphocytes, existence of dissociation in indicators of relative and absolute values of the T-cellular link, CD16+56+(-) NK-cells and B-lymphocytes with increase of absolute values, decrease in markers of activation of HLA-DR+ and CD95+, increase of B-lymphocytes and low level of serum IgM. Features of IS in comparison with the group of the personnel with the absence of 239Pu in an organism and indicators of IS which depend on the activity of 239Pu are established. Among them are a decrease in the percentage of persons with increased number of lymphocytes with increased beam loading; increase of NK-T-cells when the activity of 239Pu is 10-20 nCi and the highest value at doses over40 nCi; the dynamics of CD16+56(+)-lymphocytes with the increase of the contents and a percentage of persons with the increase of the activity above 40 nCi; the highest frequenc of a regulatory imbalance with high frequency decrease of CD8(+)-T-lymphocytes at the content of 239Pu > 0-10 nCi; decrease in indicators of B-lymphocytes and serum IgA with an increase in the activity of 239Pu with the lowest values under internal radiation over 40 nCi; decrease in the percentage of persons with a weakening expression of HLA-DR+ with the increase in dose loading.",Included
1827,"Preparation, characterization of 99mTc-folic acid/chitosan nanostructure and their biodistribution study in quail Chitosan (CS) of low molecular weight is prepared using gamma-irradiation method in presence of H2O2 as oxidizing agent. The chemical treatment of folic acid (FA) with low molecular weight CS is carried out to prepare FACS complex based on the reaction between [Formula presented]2 group of CS and gamma-COOH group of FA. The structure and properties of FACS complex was characterized by FT-IR, 1H NMR, UV, SEM, TEM, DLS and XRD analyses. TEM and DLS results showed that FACS complex has nanostructure and the mean size of particles was unimodal with average diameters in the range of 165-252 nm. Radiolabeling of FACS complex (99mTc-FACS) was done with Technetium-99 m (99mTc). The optimum conditions of labeling were investigated. The labeling yield was 85% at pH = 6 and 30 min reaction time. The effect of time on the stability of 99mTc-FACS complex was studied and the results revealed that it is stable up to 6 h after labeling. Biodistribution studies of 99mTc-FACS complex in Quail showed that it distributed to different organs mainly in blood, liver and kidney. The results revealed that the uptake of 99mTc-FACS in the sexual organs (ovary and ovarian) of female Quail was higher than that in the sexual organs (testes) of male Quail, so 99mTc-FACS could be used to differentiate between them. It also showed that FACS is consumed and more essential in female than that in male.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

1564,"Low dose radiotherapy is associated with local complications but not disease control in sacral chordoma BACKGROUND: We reviewed the disease control and complications of the treatment of sacrococcygeal chordoma from four tertiary cancer centers with emphasis on the effects of radiotherapy in surgically treated patients., METHODS: A total of 193 patients with primary sacrococcygeal chordoma from 1990 to 2015 were reviewed. There were 124 males, with a mean age of 59 +/- 15 years and a mean follow-up of 7 +/- 4 years. Eighty-nine patients received radiotherapy with a mean total dose of 61.8 +/- 10.9 Gy., RESULTS: The 10-year disease-free and disease-specific survival was 58% and 72%, respectively. Radiation was not associated with local recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-2.17; P = 0.71), metastases (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.45-1.91; P = 0.85) or disease-specific survival (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.46-2.00; P = 0.91). Higher doses (>=70 Gy; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.20-1.32; P = 0.17) may be associated with reduced local recurrence. Radiotherapy was associated with wound complications (HR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.64-4.82;, P < 0.001) and sacral stress fractures (HR, 4.73; 95% CI, 1.88-14.38; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter review, radiotherapy was not associated with tumor outcome but associated with complications. The routine use of radiotherapy with en-bloc resection of sacrococcygeal chordomas should be reconsidered in favor of a selective, individualized approach with a radiation dose of >=70 Gy.

2684,"Effects of (12)C(6+) ion radiation and ferulic acid on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryonic oxidative stress response and gene expression The effects of carbon ion irradiation and ferulic acid (FA) on the induction of oxidative stress and alteration of gene expression were studied in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1Gy, 3Gy and 7Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn-sod, Mn-sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.

2625,"Radiographic Union Scoring Scale for Determining Consolidation Rates in the Calcaneus The reliable evaluation of osseous consolidation after hindfoot osteotomy can be difficult. Concomitant hindfoot osteotomies often dictate the advancement of weightbearing, and radiographs are the mainstay imaging tool owing to cost, efficiency, and radiation exposure. Understanding the radiographic parameters that can be used to reliably determine osseous healing is paramount. However, currently, no reliable or validated method is available to determine osseous healing of hindfoot osteotomies in irregular bones of the foot. The purpose of the present study was to develop a radiographic healing scoring system that would enhance the diagnostic healing assessment after elective calcaneal osteotomy. We adapted existing orthopedic scales validated for healing in the leg for application in the irregular bones of the foot. A total of 168 cases were evaluated by 6 blinded assessors to test the interrater reliability of subjective healing assessment compared with the proposed scoring system. The radiographs were classified by postoperative period: <=4 weeks, 5 to 12 weeks, and >12 weeks. The proposed scale had high interrater reliability but was burdensome. Using a priori item reduction protocols, a limited 6-item scale further improved internal consistency and reduced the burden. The result was excellent interrater reliability (alpha = 0.98, standard deviation 0.02, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 0.96) among all assessors when using the scoring scale compared with unacceptable reliability (alpha = 0.438) for subjective osteotomy healing. The reliability of our system appeared superior to that of subjective assessment of osseous healing alone, even in the absence of clinical correlates after osteotomy of the calcaneus.

The global and age-specific mortality rates appeared to be lower than those for the general population. The structure of mortality from external causes differed in some way from that of the general population: the percentage of accidents connected with transport and of murders was lower, whereas it was higher for suicides. The mortality rate from specific causes including suicides, however, was lower than in the general population. The level of radiation exposure did not influence the mortality rates from the studied causes.",Included

The study group consisted of 24 subjects matched with a control population by the number of participants, age, gender ratio, active smoking status, the period of blood sampling, and residence. Based on regular dosimetry using thermoluminiscent dosimeters, our study group occupationally received a dose of 1.82 +/- 3.60 mSv over the last year. The results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay and the comet assay showed a higher nuclear buds frequency (4.09 +/- 1.88) and tail length (15.46 +/- 1.47 mum) than in the control group (2.96 +/- 1.67, 14.05 +/- 1.36 mum, respectively).

Quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect miR-330 expression in serum. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the prognostic value of miR-330 for the radiation sensitivity of brain metastasis from LC. Related clinical factors for radiation sensitivity were assessed by logistic regression analysis, and a survival analysis was conducted using COX regression and the Kaplan-Meier method., RESULTS: MiR-330 exhibited lower expression in the radiation-sensitive group than in the radiation-resistant group. The area under the ROC curve of miR-330 for predicting radiation sensitivity was 0.898 (optimal cut-off value, 0.815), with a sensitivity of 71.7% and a specificity of 90.1%. After radiation therapy, patients with low miR-330 expression, compared to patients with high miR-330 expression, displayed a lower survival rate and a median survival time. MiR-330 expression was correlated with extracranial metastasis, maximum BM diameter, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and node (N) stage. Logistic regression and COX regression analyses revealed that extracranial metastasis, TNM stage, N stage and miR-330 expression were factors that influenced both radiation sensitivity and individual prognostic factors in patients with BM from LC., CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the downregulation of miR-330 correlates with radiation sensitivity and poor prognosis in patients with BM from LC.

750,"Systematic effects of surgical treatment of hip fractures: gliding screw-plating vs intramedullary nailing AIM: Numerous studies have been published regarding the comparison between intramedullary nail and the dynamic hip screw and plate for the fixation of intertrochanteric fractures in elderly patients. In this paper we present a comparative study of these two methods regarding their systemic effects on this group of patients., MATERIALS-METHODS: This is a randomized trial of 120 consecutive patients with an intertrochanteric fracture treated with either extramedullary fixation (dynamic hip screw and plate; DHS, Synthes-Stratec, Oberdorf, Switzerland) or intramedullary nail (Gamma nail, Stryker Howmedica, Freiburg, Germany and Endovis BA, Citieffe, Bologna, Italy). The parameters that we assessed pre-operatively, in addition to their demographics, included their mental state (MMSE), their nutritional and immune state and their pulmonary function. Intra-operatively we calculated the amount of radiation exposure, the amount of blood loss and the length of operative time for each procedure. Postoperatively we repeated the calculation of the mental and pulmonary state and the blood loss, during days 1, 3, and 10 and related them to the ease of the patient's mobilization., RESULTS: Decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). However, in the same group there were slightly more patients in whom the MMSE was falling, together with their pulmonary function, suggesting that this method probably predisposes to higher chances of pulmonary dysfunction and the possibility of pulmonary embolism., CONCLUSION: We found no significant differences between the two methods of stabilization of these fractures regarding their systemic effects perioperatively. The classic dynamic hip screw can preserve its position as a safe and effective solution for these already vulnerable patients having sustained a trochanteric fracture against the novel intramedullary techniques.

The study included 140 healthy volunteers, 33 people were irradiated for 2 days, 34 - for 10 days and 33 - for 30 days with SSR. Forty non-irradiated individuals served as controls. All the volunteers were sensitized with diphenylocyclopropenone (DPCP) 24 h after final exposure. Statistical analysis comparing intensity of CHS reaction based on visual score between irradiated groups and non-irradiated group revealed no differences (p>0.05). We found a significant difference in epidermal thickness between healthy skin and irradiated groups (p<0.05) and a positive correlation between intensity of spongiosis and clinical score for CHS response at 3.2 DPCP site (p<0.000001). A negative correlation between time of irradiation and spongiosis score was revealed (R=-0.28; p<0.001).

Acute oesophageal reactions and analgesia were scored for up to 8 weeks after the start of RT. Pneumonitis, lung fibrosis, spinal cord and oesophageal strictures, were assessed using clinical and radiological criteria from 3 months onwards and throughout the study. Haematological and gastrointestinal toxicity was monitored in those patients undergoing CT. Endpoints for treatment outcome were overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional control., RESULTS: Chemotherapy enhanced the incidence and duration of acute dysphagia,but the increase was transient. Healing occurred in all cases and there has been no evidence of long-term oesophageal complications. Clinically, almost 25% of those receiving CT+RT had Grade 2 pneumonitis, higher than seen with RT alone. However, the 1 patient with severe Grade 3 pneumonitis was in the RT 60 Gy alone group. An incidence of 17% Grade 2 pulmonary fibrosis at 2 years was seen with CT, slightly lower than with RT alone. To date, there is no evidence of Grade 3 lung fibrosis. There was a higher scoring of lung damage with the radiological endpoint, which gave no indication that CT increased pulmonary toxicity over that of RT alone. Loco-regional control at 2 years was 37% and 55% for CHARTWEL 54 Gy and 60 Gy alone compared with 72% in those treated with 60 Gy and neo-adjuvant CT However, this did not translate into a survival advantage., CONCLUSIONS: This study of CHARTWEL combined with induction chemotherapy, has shown that the strategy is feasible and that a possible therapeutic benefit may be obtained by the addition of CT. Although neo-adjuvant treatment increased acute mucosal reactions and slight-to-moderate pneumonitis seen with CHARTWEL 60 Gy, the clinical management and quality of life of these patients is similar to those treated with radiotherapy alone.",Excluded

The study aimed to ascertain the success of Astra-Tech implants in this patient group. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients who were restored with Astra Tech implants after ablative head and neck surgery were evaluated by analyzing serial prospectively accrued data since April 2006. Patient's data who received implants in the mandible were selected to be evaluated regarding implant success and contributing factors. Implant survival was calcula ted by the Kaplan-Meier analysis (Stat-View Version 4.1, Abacus Concepts, Inc.) and Cox models were used to evaluate any association between implant failure and reconstructive or medical treatment modality. Result(s): A total of 136 implants were placed in 33 patients during December 2006 to April 2012. Ten of the subjects were females and 23 were males with a mean age of 65 years. 21 patients received radiotherapy with a cumulative radiation dose between 56 Gray and 76 Gray. In six patients failures were noted resulting in a loss of 17 implants. Cumulative survival rates were 92.7% after 1 year and 87.5% after years two and three.

1236,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy with concurrent full-dose gemcitabine for locally advanced pancreatic cancer: A pilot trial demonstrating safety Background: Concurrent chemoradiation is a standard option for locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). Concurrent conventional radiation with full-dose gemcitabine has significant toxicity. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) may provide the opportunity to administer radiation in a shorter time frame with similar efficacy and reduced toxicity. This Pilot study assessed the safety of concurrent full-dose gemcitabine with SBRT for LAPC. Method(s): Patients received gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. During week 4 of cycle 1, patients received SBRT (25 Gy delivered in five consecutive daily fractions of 5 Gy prescribed to the 75-83% isodose line). Acute and late toxicities were assessed using NIH CTCAE v3. Tumor response was assessed by RECIST. Patients underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy at baseline, 2, and 6 months to assess the duodenal mucosa. Quality of life (QoL) data was collected before and after treatment using the QLQ-C30 and QLQ-PAN26 questionnaires. Result(s): Between September 2009 and February 2011, 11 patients enrolled with one withdrawal during radiation therapy. Patients had grade 1 to 2 gastrointestinal toxicity from the start of SBRT to 2 weeks after treatment. There were no grade 3 or greater radiation-related toxicities or delays for cycle 2 of gemcitabine. On endoscopy, there were no grade 2 or higher mucosal toxicities. Two patients had a partial response. The median progression free and overall survival were 6.8 and 12.2 months, respectively. Global QoL did not change between baseline and immediately after radiation treatment. Conclusion(s): SBRT with concurrent full dose gemcitabine is safe when administered to patients with LAPC. There is no delay in administration of radiation or chemotherapy, and radiation is completed with minimal toxicity. © 2013 Gurka et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Initial treatment is in the form of medical therapies. Patients with medically refractory ET seek surgical intervention which include radiofrequency thalamotomy, deep brain stimulation, and radiosurgical thalamotomy. Radiosurgical thalamotomy is a minimally invasive surgical option which is especially valuable for elderly and high surgical risk patients. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the outcomes of stereotactic radiosurgery for patients suffering from medically refractory essential tremor. Method(s): During a 19-year period (1996-2015), 73 patients underwent gamma knife thalamotomy for intractable essential tremor. A median central dose of 140 Gy (range, 130-150) was delivered to the nucleus ventralis intermedius through a single 4-mm isocenter. We used the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin clinical tremor rating scale to score tremor, handwriting, drawing, and ability to drink fluids. The median time to last follow-up was 28 months (range, 6-152). Result(s): After gamma knife thalamotomy, 93.2% improved in tremor. Forty-four patients (60.3%) experienced tremor arrest or barely perceptible tremor. Eighteen patients (24.7%) noted tremor arrest and complete restoration of motor function. Tremor improvement was sustained at last follow-up in 96% of patients who experience tremor relief. Mean tremor score improved from 3.19 before to 1.27 after gamma knife thalamotomy (P < 0.0001). Mean handwriting score improved from 2.97 to 1.25 (P < 0.0001). Mean drawing score improved from 3.16 to 1.26 (P < 0.0001). Mean drinking score improved from 3.14 to 1.56 (P < 0.0001). Imaging follow-up showed three types of lesions: enhancing lesion, streaking along internal capsule on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and significant reactive changes. Three patients (4%) experienced temporary adverse radiation effects.

Antiscatter grid (ASG) removal is used to decrease radiation exposure but may reduce image quality. Purpose To determine whether ASG removal during spinal DSA in adults reduces radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality and whether dose reduction is related to body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods This Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant prospective study included adults undergoing spinal DSA between January and December 2016. Each procedure included an additional angiographic acquisition performed twice, once with and once without ASG, either documenting the artery of Adamkiewicz (no pathology group) or the condition leading to the procedure (pathology group). Dose differences between study acquisitions and the influence of BMI were evaluated via paired t test. Two neurointerventionalists blinded to acquisition protocols were asked to independently evaluate a sample of 40 study acquisitions (20 with ASG, 20 without ASG) from 20 randomly selected participants to (a) rate image quality, (b) categorize findings, and (c) determine whether images had been obtained with or without ASG. Percentage agreement on image quality, findings categorization, and ability to correctly identify the acquisition protocol was calculated for both readers. Results Fifty-three participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 51 years +/- 15.2; 32 men) were evaluated. ASG removal reduced the mean dose per acquisition by approximately 33% (mean dose-area product and air kerma decreased from 202 to 135.6 microGy/m2 and from 35.3 to 24 mGy, respectively; P < .001) independently of BMI (P = .3). Both readers evaluated all images (40 of 40) as being of diagnostic quality and correctly categorized findings in 19 of 20 (95%) cases.

Colonic motility was analyzed in 21 healthy subjects using 84-sensor manometry catheters with 1-cm sensor spacing. Capsule endoscopy and manometry showed evidence of narrow rhythmic circular muscle contractions. X-ray images of haustra and sensor locations allowed us to identify manometry motor activity as intrahaustral activity. Two common motor patterns were observed that we infer to be associated with individual haustra: rhythmic pressure activity confined to a single sensor, and activity confined to a section of the colon of 3-6 cm length. Intrahaustral activity was observed by 3-4 sensors. Approximately 50% of the haustra were intermittently active for -30% of the time; 2,402 periods of haustral activity were analyzed. Intrahaustral activity showed rhythmic pressure waves, propagating in mixed direction, 5-30 mmHg in amplitude at a frequency of -3 cpm (range 2-6) or -12 cpm (range 7-15), or exhibiting a checkerboard segmentation pattern. Boundaries of the haustra showed rhythmic pressure activity with or without elevated baseline pressure. Active haustra often showed no boundary activity probably allowing transit to neighboring haustra. Haustral boundaries were seen at the same sensor for the 6- to 8-h study duration, indicating that they did not propagate, thereby likely contributing to continence. The present study elucidates the motility characteristics of haustral boundaries and the nature of intrahaustral motor patterns and paves the way for investigating their possible role in pathophysiology of defecation disorders.Copyright © 2021 the American Physiological Society",Excluded
254,"Long-term outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for pituitary adenomas at the BC cancer agency Purpose To assess the long-term disease control and toxicity outcomes of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) in patients with pituitary adenomas treated at the BC Cancer Agency. Methods and Materials To ensure a minimum of 5 years of clinical follow-up, this study identified a cohort of 76 patients treated consecutively with FSRT between 1998 and 2007 for pituitary adenomas: 71% (54/76) had nonfunctioning and 29% (22/76) had functioning adenomas (15 adrenocorticotrophic hormone-secreting, 5 growth hormone-secreting, and 2 prolactin-secreting). Surgery was used before FSRT in 96% (73/76) of patients. A median isocenter dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered in 28 fractions, with 100% of the planning target volume covered by the 90% isodose. Patients were followed up clinically by endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, and radiation oncologists. Serial magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess tumor response. Results With a median follow-up time of 6.8 years (range, 0.6 - 13.1 years), the 7-year progression-free survival was 97.1% and disease-specific survival was 100%. Of the 2 patients with tumor progression, both had disease control after salvage surgery. Of the 22 patients with functioning adenomas, 50% (11/22) had complete and 9% (2/22) had partial responses after FSRT. Of the patients with normal pituitary function at baseline, 48% (14/29) experienced 1 or more hormone deficiencies after FSRT. Although 79% (60/76) of optic chiasms were at least partially within the planning target volumes, no patient experienced radiation-induced optic neuropathy. No patient experienced radionecrosis. No secondary malignancy occurred during follow-up. Conclusion In this study of long-term follow-up of patients treated for pituitary adenomas, FSRT was safe and effective. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Included
1110,"Cancer incidence among Danish Thorotrast-exposed patients BACKGROUND: Studies of groups of patients given injections of the alpha-emitting x-ray contrast medium Thorotrast may provide information on human alpha-ray carcinogenesis., PURPOSE: We re-established a formerly identified cohort of neurological patients receiving injections of Thorotrast for cerebral arteriography and assessed their incidence of cancer., METHODS: Using the national population register, the Danish Cancer Registry, and other registers, we determined the incidence of cancer among Thorotrast-injected patients. Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites., RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed. Cancer risk was increased at most other sites, although this increase was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: Alpha radiation may account for the increased risk of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma, whereas confounding factors most probably contribute to the increased risks at other sites.",Excluded
2523,"Image quality and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Influence of imaging direction with 64-slice dual-source CT Background: The evaluation of native coronary arteries (NCAs) as well as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency after surgery is essential. However, NCAs are often blurred in the craniocaudal scan direction because of long scan time with 64-slice CT. Objective(s): The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of scan direction on image quality and radiation exposure in assessment of NCAs and CABGs. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 191 consecutive individuals undergoing coronary CT angiography to evaluate CABG patency using 64-slice dual source CT. A retrospectively ECG gated spiral acquisition protocol with ECG based tube current modulation and automatic adjustment of tube current to a reference of 320 mAs (""CareDose 4D"") was used. Tube current was 120 kVp. Scan direction was either cranio-caudal (CRC, n = 98) or caudo-cranial (CRC, n = 93) and the scan volume covered the entire course of all bypass grafts. Independent investigators determined quantitative image quality of the coronary arteries by evaluating contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation exposure by comparing the effective dose, and qualitative image quality through a 5 point rating scale. Result(s): Quantitative image quality was not significantly different for the two groups except for the CNR of the right coronary artery which was significantly higher in patients with caudio-cranial scan direction (P= .0007). The qualitative image quality of the CaC group also was better for both NCAs and CABGs (P= .002 for NCAs and <.001 for CABGs), mostly because of the lower frequency of respiration artifacts on coronary arteries of the CaC group (P= .005). As an effect of automatic tube current adjustment, radiation dose was lower in patients with caudo-cranial scan direction (6.8 mSv vs. 9.6 mSv, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In patients with coronary bypass grafts imaged by 64-slice dual source CT with spiral acquisition and automated tube current adjustment, a caudo-cranial scan direction results in improved image quality and reduced radiation exposure. © 2014 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography.",Excluded
3063,"Factors determining fluoroscopy time during ureteroscopy Purpose: The aim of this study was to prospectively identify predictors of radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. Patients and Methods: Eighty-five consecutive patients who presented for ureteroscopies and laser lithotripsy were considered. Fluoroscopy time (FT) was obtained from radiology reports for each patient, and clinical data were obtained from chart review. Nine patients were excluded (three unconfirmed FTs, four staghorn calculi, one ectopic kidney, and one multiple ureteral strictures). Seventy-six patients were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to identify factors that determined FT. Result(s): The patient cohort was 65.8% male with a mean age of 52.7 years. Mean FT was 183s, and mean surgical time was 68.4+/-29 minutes. Mean stone size was 10+/-5mm in the greatest dimension. A large proportion of patients (50%) had renal stones, multiple stones were present in 31.6% of cases, and 22.3% of stones were radiolucent. Cases were equally distributed between surgeons A and B, and 46% of patients had preoperative stents. On multivariate analysis, increased FT was independently associated with surgeon A (104 additional seconds per case, P<0.001), longer duration of surgery (14s per 10 minutes, P<0.001), and male patients (54s per procedure, P=0.02). Age, stone characteristics, presence of ureteral stent, and stone-free status did not correlate with FT. Conclusion(s): Surgeon behavior, longer duration of surgery, and male gender were significant predictors of FT and, hence, radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. In the present study, stone characteristics were not found to be predictors of FT. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded
861,"Different trend for changing of mammalian plasma (serum) antioxidant activity after irradiation at large and low-doses One of the path for research of antioxidant status in vivo is the determination of blood plasma (serum) antioxidant activity (AOA). AOA is an integral parameter for the contribution of different antiradical defense components which particular nomenclature is determined by a used method of definition. In the present work AOA is studied with usage of a system of suppression in vitro by blood plasma (serum) of a Fe(2+)-induced oxidation of a substrate from egg yolk lipoproteins. The contribution of separate components of a blood plasma to an integral index of AOA for human blood serum is studied. Urine acid, albumin, reduced glutathione, ascorbat, heparin, peroxidase and catalase had no activity. Apo-beta-lipoprotein, vitamin E, ceruloplasmin and transferring are introduce, possibly, the main contribution to AOA. The significant decrease of AOA was revealed after acute irradiation by gamma-rays of dogs (4.05 Gy) and mice (6 Gy). The irradiation of mice at low-dose (0.2 Gy), vice-versa, result to stimulation of AOA with clear peak value on 5 day. The possible reasons of quality difference for effects of large and low dose radiation with reference to antioxidant system of organism are discussed.",Included
3021,"Intravesical glycosaminoglycan replenishment with chondroitin sulphate in chronic forms of cystitis: A multi-national, multi-centre, prospective observational clinical trial Effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of instillation therapy with chondroitin sulphate (CAS 9082-07-9, Gepan instill) was investigated in a non-interventional study. 286 patients with clinically diagnosed chronic forms of cystitis, such as bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, radiation cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome and chronically-recurring cystitis were included. The course of symptoms was documented over 8 instillations at maximum, covering a period of approximately three months. All main symptoms of chronic cystitis declined consistently and statistically significantly (p < 0.0001). Both daytime and nighttime micturition frequencies as well as the score levels of urgency and pain declined significantly during the course of treatment. The functional bladder capacity as indicated by the volume of first morning voiding increased from 157.9 ml +/- 7.5 to 186.7 ml +/- 6.9 (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). The level of urgency decreased from 6.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE; numerical rating scale (11-point box scale); p < 0.0001) and nocturia decreased from 4.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 times (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). Chondroitin sulphate instillation was effective and well tolerated in the therapy of chronic forms of cystitis associated with a possible GAG layer deficit (GAG layer: mainly composed of the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate), but the results need to be confirmed in a controlled study. © ECV .

594,"Myocardial infarction mortality risk after treatment for hodgkin disease: A collaborative British cohort study Background Myocardial infarction is a major cause of excess long-term mortality in survivors of Hodgkin disease, but limited information exists on the effects of specific chemotherapy regimens used to treat these patients on their risk of death from myocardial infarction. Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded
27,"Can both cruciate ligaments be preserved in knee arthroplasty? Eight- to nine-year follow-up of a bicompartmental knee replacement Preservation of native knee anatomy may confer improved patient satisfaction, as suggested by patient satisfaction scores in unicondylar versus total knee replacement. Bicompartmental knee replacement (BKR) implants similarly promote native tissue preservation. We retrospectively reviewed 42 consecutive patients who underwent BKR from 2006 to 2007. Outcome measures were evaluated. At an average follow-up of 103 months (range 87-110), 34/42 (81%) of implants survived. Among the retained implants, the Knee Society Score (KSS) grade was excellent in 26/34 (76.5%), good in 5/34 (14.7%), fair in 3/34 (8.8%), and poor in 0/34 (0%) of cases. Midterm results of BKR demonstrated 81% survival and 76% with excellent KSS grading. Despite a 20% revision rate at the short-term follow-up, the retained implants functioned well at the midterm follow-up.Copyright © 2016 by Begell House, Inc.",Excluded
1166,"Head and neck radiotherapy does not increase gelatinase (metalloproteinase-2 and -9) expression or activity in teeth irradiated in vivo OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggested that head and neck radiotherapy increases active forms of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ), leading to enamel delamination and radiation-related caries. This study aimed to assess the expression and activity of the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex tissues of teeth irradiated in vivo., STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-six teeth were studied, including 19 irradiated and 17 non-irradiated controls. In situ zymography was used to investigate the gelatinolytic activity in the micromorphologic components of enamel, DEJ, dentin-pulp complex, and caries. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted on the demineralized samples to assess MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression levels in the DEJ, dentin-pulp complex components, and caries., RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were detected between groups in gelatinolytic activity or in MMP-2 expression levels (P > .05). Odontoblast MMP-9 expression was reduced in the irradiated group (P = .02)., CONCLUSIONS: The study rejected the hypothesis that MMP-2 and MMP-9 would be overexpressed or more activated in the DEJ and dentin-pulp complex of irradiated teeth. Direct effects of radiation should not be regarded as an independent factor for explaining radiation-related caries onset and progression. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

2277,"Imaging in Patients with Crohn's Disease: Trends in Abdominal CT/MRI Utilization and Radiation Exposure Considerations over a 10-Year Period Purpose: To study the trends in utilization of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with Crohn's disease and to evaluate changes in CT radiation exposure over a 10-year period. Method(s): In this institutional review board-approved single-institution retrospective study, we included patients who underwent CT and MRIs for evaluation of Crohn's disease between 2006 and 2015. A total of 3196 CTs and 1924 MR scans were performed in 2156 patients (mean age: 34.8 +/- 17.71 yr; range: 3-91 yr) for initial diagnosis or follow-up of Crohn's disease between 2006 and 2015. Trends in CT/MR utilization was assessed by comparing the volume of CT/MRI studies performed each year. The changes in CT radiation exposure over the study period were estimated and compared. Result(s): The annual combined CT/MR utilization demonstrated a 1.9-fold rise over the last decade (2006: n = 358, 2015: n = 681, P < 0.001, r = 0.96). It was predominantly because of a substantial growth (9.2-fold increase) in the MR scan volume (2006: n = 37, 2015: n = 341, P < 0.001, r = 0.93), whereas CT volume did not show significant change (2006: n = 321, 2015: n = 340, P = 0.6). Over this same period, there was a 59.4% reduction in mean radiation exposure (2006: CT dose index vol 16.9 +/- 7.1 mGy, 2015: CT dose index vol 6.87 +/- 4.62 mGy, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): A 9-fold growth in annual MR scan volume contributed to a nearly 2-fold rise in yearly cross-sectional imaging utilization in Crohn's patients between 2006 and 2015. Rising trend in imaging utilization paralleled a 60% reduction of CT radiation exposure.Copyright © 2017 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.",Excluded
2412,"The clinical role of X-ray computed tomography to predict the clinical efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Aim: To evaluate the clinical efficiency of computed tomography for diagnostics of patients with urolithiasis and the choice of treatment strategy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study was carried out at the Urological Clinic of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University and included 1044 patients with urinary stones. The ultimate goal of this study was to predict the clinical efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy using a combination of computed tomography and densitometry. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed on ""Siemens Lithostar Plus,"" ""Siemens Modularis Uro,"" and ""Dornier Gemini"" lithotripters. Statistical analysis of clinical data included evaluation of individual sampling groups and calculation of weighted arithmetic mean (M). Result(s): The efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has been determined primarily using X-ray analysis of the concrement outlines and the structure (homogeneous or heterogeneous) of its central zone. However, in terms of efficiency and repetition rate (the number of fragmentation procedures required for complete clearance) of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, the mean density of the concrement along the whole length of its three-dimensional structure (expressed in Hounsfield units) appeared to be the most reliable and informative predictive index in this study. Conclusion(s): The combination of computed tomography with densitometry in the treatment of patients with urolithiasis allows one (1) to determine the exact localization, size, X-ray structure, and structural density of urinary stones and (2) to predict, on the basis of densitometric data histograms, the clinical efficiency and repetition rate of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy with due regard to the X-ray structure of peripheral and central zones, and mean density (in Hounsfield units) of urinary concrements.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",Excluded
3168,"A randomized trial comparing levothyroxine with radioactive iodine in the treatment of sporadic nontoxic goiter A randomized clinical trial was performed in consecutive patients with sporadic nontoxic nodular goiter to compare efficacy and side effects of iodine-131 (131I) therapy with suppressive levothyroxine (L-thyroxine) treatment. Sixty-four patients were randomized after stratification for sex and menopausal age to receive 131I (4.44 MBq/g thyroid; group A) or suppressive L-thyroxine treatment aiming at TSH values between 0.01 and 0.1 mU/L (group B). The main outcome measurements after 2 yr were goiter size by ultrasound, serum thyroid function tests, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty-seven patients completed the trial. Goiter size was reduced after 2 yr by 44% in group A and by 1% in group B (P < 0.001). Nonresponders (goiter reduction < 13%)were 1 of 29 patients in group A and 16 of 28 patients in group B (P = 0.00001). In responders, goiter reduction in group A (46%) was greater than in group B (22%; P < 0.005). In group A, 45% of patients developed hypothyroidism. In group B, 10 patients experienced thyrotoxic symptoms, requiring discontinuation of treatment in 2 (in 1 because of atrial fibrillation). Markers of bone formation and bone resorption increased significantly in group B, related to a mean decrease of 3.6% of BMD at the lumbar spine after 2 yr (from 1.09 +/- 0.22 to 1.05 +/- 0.23 g/cm2; P < 0.001), both in pre- and postmenopausal women. No changes in BMD were observed in group A. In conclusion, 131I therapy is more effective and better tolerated than L-thyroxine treatment in patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter. Suppressive L-thyroxine treatment results in significant bone loss.",Excluded
1635,"Ultrasound Guidance Reduces Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Cost Compared to Fluoroscopy OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost factors associated with ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance for percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) and to determine which method can be performed at a lower cost per case., METHODS: A cost comparison study was performed utilizing clinical data from a prospectively maintained research database. We included the most recent 33 consecutive ultrasound-guided PCNL cases in 2016 and the most recent 40 consecutive fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases before the operative surgeon transitioned to ultrasound guidance in May 2014. The total operative time and clinical outcomes were examined. Costs were extracted from the institution accounting systems and given a uniform multiplier to protect institutional financial reporting confidentiality. Comparisons were made using the Student t test and the chi-squared test., RESULTS: After excluding outliers, 71 PCNL procedures were included in the analysis. Demographic data and stone characteristics were not different between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided groups. However, the mean operative time for ultrasound-guided PCNL was significantly shorter (99.8 +/- 27.0 vs 144.9 +/- 55.1 minutes, P < .05). When capital equipment costs were included, the mean total cost per case of ultrasound-guided PCNL was approximately 30% less than fluoroscopy-guided PCNL (simulated costs with a uniform multiplier; $5258.90 +/- 957.12 vs $7508.60 +/- 1163.83, P < .05). Postoperative clinical outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups., CONCLUSION: When capital costs are included, ultrasound-guided PCNL can produce comparable clinical outcomes to fluoroscopy-guided procedures at a lower cost to the institution. Shorter operative time drives significant savings with the adoption of ultrasound guidance, which may be magnified with increasing case volume. Using ultrasound imaging during PCNL may be more cost-effective compared to fluoroscopy and warrants further study. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2124,"A new model of biodosimetry to integrate low and high doses Biological dosimetry, that is the estimation of the dose of an exposure to ionizing radiation by a biological parameter, is a very important tool in cases of radiation accidents. The score of dicentric chromosomes, considered to be the most accurate method for biological dosimetry, for low LET radiation and up to 5 Gy, fits very well to a linear-quadratic model of dose-effect curve assuming the Poisson distribution. The accuracy of this estimation raises difficulties for doses over 5 Gy, the highest dose of the majority of dose-effect curves used in biological dosimetry. At doses over 5 Gy most cells show difficulties in reaching mitosis and cannot be used to score dicentric chromosomes. In the present study with the treatment of lymphocyte cultures with caffeine and the standardization of the culture time, metaphases for doses up to 25 Gy have been analyzed. Here we present a new model for biological dosimetry, which includes a Gompertz-type function as the dose response, and also takes into account the underdispersion of aberration-among-cell distribution. The new model allows the estimation of doses of exposures to ionizing radiation of up to 25 Gy. Moreover, the model is more effective in estimating whole and partial body exposures than the classical method based on linear and linear-quadratic functions, suggesting their effectiveness and great potential to be used after high dose exposures of radiation.",Excluded

Chromosome arms 1p, 1q, 7q, and 11p were also significantly more affected. Some bands also showed a special sensitivity to radiation, and band 1q32 was the most affected. This band is proposed as a hot point"" for the clastogenic effect of ionizing radiation. A significant clustering of breakpoints in G bands was also found, especially at the telomeres, as previously described by other authors. Clustering of breakpoints was also observed in bands where fragile sites, protooncogenes, breakpoints involved in chromosomal cancer rearrangements, and breakpoints involved in chromosomal evolution of the Hominoidea are located.""",Included
3135,"X-ray enhancement of splenic rosette-forming cells in nonimmune mice The formation of rosettes between spleen cells from nonimmune mice and sheep red blood cells (SRBC) has been investigated. The number of splenic rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the intact spleen was very low but greatly increased after sublethal whole body x-irradiation. These cells were inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AKR anti-C3H- antigen antiserum, in the presence of fresh guinea pig serum, but not with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin antiserum. The splenic RFC also increased after cortisone acetate administration into mice. These results suggest that the RFC are a T cell sub-population having x-ray resistant and cortisone-insensitive characteristics. The x-irradiation of mice in vivo selectively increased the number of splenic RFC in consequence of reduction in the number of cells having non-T cell characteristics. These RFC are presumably antigen-specific sheep red blood cell rosettes, a quite different situation as in the case of human T lymphocyte rosette formation.",Included
2700,"Utility of postoperative radiographs after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior instrumentation STUDY DESIGN.: Retrospective clinical and radiographical review. OBJECTIVE.: To evaluate the utility of plain radiographical surveillance after anterior lumbar interbody fusion and determine to what extent radiographical findings affect postoperative decision making. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographical surveillance is a ubiquitous practice among spine surgeons, which lacks evidence and has received growing attention in an environment of increasing health care cost and receding resources. Lumbar interbody fusions are being performed with increasing frequency from numerous approaches; nonetheless, there are no evidence-based guidelines for postoperative radiographical evaluation of patients after these procedures. METHODS.: One hundred forty-six consecutive patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without short segment posterior fusion from 2008 to 2011 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were less than 6 months of follow-up, prior surgery, hybrid constructs with disc arthroplasty, and concurrent posterior fusion of greater than 3 levels. Three hundred fifty-nine radiographical series and 330 clinic notes of the included 67 patients were reviewed. Radiographs were evaluated for abnormalities and clinic notes reviewed for any changes in clinical management by multiple reviewers. Interobserver reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS.: There was no single instance of a change in treatment course based on radiographical findings alone in any of the 330 clinic visits of the 67 included patients during an average 15.8-month postoperative follow-up period. Thirty-four of the 67 patients (51%) had some change in their management on the basis of their clinical symptoms and/or examination. Interobserver agreement for change in management was 0.96 (kappa = 0.918). Sensitivity (6%), specificity (97%), positive predictive value (67%), and negative predictive value (50%) were calculated. CONCLUSION.: Routine postoperative radiographical surveillance has minimal value for asymptomatic patients after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior fusion. Obtaining a limited number of postoperative films of these patients in the absence of clinical symptoms or risk factors could significantly reduce health care costs and unnecessary radiation exposure. © 2013, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded

Sixteen medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi underwent minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy procedures in our center were entered into this retrospective study. The data analyzed included patients' demographics, stone burden, operative time, operative blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications according to the modified Clavien system, and stone-free rate. All the patients in this study had complex renal stones that included 14 multiple stones and 3 partial staghorn calculi. The mean stone surface area was 779.5 +/- 421.1 mm2. Preoperative urinary tract infection was noted in 5 (31.2 %) patients. Minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was successfully completed in 15 renal units in 14 patients. Two patients failed the procedure. The mean operative time was 87.3 +/- 32.3 min. Mean hemoglobin drop was 25.3 +/- 16.5 g/L. An initial stone-free rate of 60 % was achieved after the procedure, and the final stone-free rate was 86.6 % after auxiliary second look and/or shock-wave lithotripsy. Clavien grade I and II complications occurred in 3 (21.4 %) patients including the one (7.1 %) patient who required transfusion. All the complications were managed conservatively. No major complications occurred. This retrospective analysis confirmed that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy was a safe alternative treatment for the medullary sponge kidney patients with complex renal calculi. This procedure provided an acceptable stone-free rate and low incidence of high-grade complications. Stone-free rate further could be further improved with auxiliary procedures.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Forty-one patients received concomitant chemoradiotherapy with vinorelbine/cisplatin (VC), 35 with docetaxel/cisplatin (DC). AE was graded according to criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG).

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to test the association between the different factors and AE., RESULTS: Seventy patients developed AE (Grade 1, 19 patients; Grade 2, 36 patients; and Grade 3, 15 patients). By multivariate logistic regression analysis, V40 was the only statistically significant factor associated with Grade >= 2 AE (p<0.001, OR = 1.159). A V40 of <23% had a 33.3% (10/30) risk of Grade >= 2 AE, which increased to 89.1% (41/46) with a V40 of >= 23% (p<0.001). CCA (p =0.01; OR = 9.686) and V50 (p<0.001; OR = 1.122) were most significantly correlated with grade 3 AE. A V50 of <26.5% had a 6.7% (3/45) risk of Grade 3 AE, which increased to 38.7% (12/31) with a V50 of >= 26.5% (p = 0.001). On the linear regression analysis, V50 and CCA were significant independent factors affecting AE duration. Patients who received concomitant chemotherapy with VC had a decreased risk of grade 3 AE and shorter duration compared with DC., CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant chemotherapy agents have potential influence on AE. Concomitant chemotherapy with VC led to lower risk of AE compared with that using DC. V40 and V50 of esophagus can predict grade >= 2 and >= 3 AE, respectively.",Excluded
543,"In vivo UHMWPE biodegradation of retrieved prosthesis Sixty-two ultra high molecular weight polyethylene prosthetic components (PEs) (31 tibial plateaux and 31 cups), sterilised by gamma rays or ethylene oxide (EtO), were retrieved after 1-12 years depending on different medical reasons and were studied by FTIR spectroscopy with derivatisation of oxidised species. Esters, acids and hydroperoxides were found under the surface of the EtO sterilised PEs up to 2 mm depth. The behaviour of gamma ray sterilised PEs is more complex due to the oxidation following the sterilisation process. Ester and acid formation might arise from the diffusion of components of synovial liquid or from the oxidation process, whereas hydroperoxide formation is thought to be due to the oxidation. Abrasion and delamination process is discussed considering the topological distribution of degradation products.",Excluded
1422,"Feasibility and potential utility of multicomponent exhaled breath analysis for predicting development of radiation pneumonitis after stereotactic ablative radiotherapy INTRODUCTION: In this prospective pilot study, we evaluated the feasibility and potential utility of measuring multiple exhaled gases as biomarkers of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung tumors., METHODS: Breath analysis was performed for 26 patients receiving SABR for lung tumors. Concentrations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO), nitrous oxide (eN2O), and carbon dioxide (eCO2) were measured before and immediately after each fraction using real-time, infrared laser spectroscopy. RP development (CTCAE grade >=2) was correlated with baseline gas concentrations, acute changes in gas concentrations after each SABR fraction, and dosimetric parameters., RESULTS: Exhaled breath analysis was successfully completed in 77% of patients. Five of 20 evaluable patients developed RP at a mean of 5.4 months after SABR. Acute changes in eNO and eCO concentrations, defined as percent changes between each pre-fraction and post-fraction measurement, were significantly smaller in RP versus non-RP cases (p = 0.022 and 0.015, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, a combined predictor of baseline eNO greater than 24 parts per billion and acute decrease in eCO less than 5.5% strongly correlated with RP incidence (p =0.0099). Neither eN2O nor eCO2 concentrations were significantly associated with RP development. Although generally higher in patients destined to develop RP, dosimetric parameters were not significantly associated with RP development., CONCLUSIONS: The majority of SABR patients in this pilot study were able to complete exhaled breath analysis. Baseline concentrations and acute changes in concentrations of exhaled breath components were associated with RP development after SABR. If our findings are validated, exhaled breath analysis may become a useful approach for noninvasive identification of patients at highest risk for developing RP after SABR.",Excluded
2130,"Subacute and chronic benign superior vena cava obstructions: Endovascular treatment with self-expanding metallic stents OBJECTIVE. Our purpose is to report our clinical experience with patients who underwent endovascular treatment with Wallstents for subacute or chronic benign obstruction of the superior vena cava (SVC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twelve patients who were an average of 54 +/- 12 years old were referred for treatment of severe SVC syndrome related to implanted central venous catheters (n = 8), postradiation fibrosis (n = 2), a permanent pacemaker (n = 1), or a benign tumor (n = 1). Symptoms were present for an average of 16 weeks (range, 4-48 weeks) before treatment. Diagnosis of SVC obstruction was confirmed with helical CT and pretherapeutic phlebography. Four patients had Stanford's type II stenosis; two, type III; and six, type IV. The mean clinical and radiologic follow-up intervals were 11 months (range, 1-36 months) and 7 months (range, 1 week to 32 months), respectively. RESULTS. Recanalization was successful in all patients. Fifteen stents were implanted in the 12 patients. Stents were placed after percutaneous balloon angioplasty in nine patients, and primary stent placement was attempted in three patients. We immediately achieved a satisfactory SVC diameter in all patients, whose symptoms were relieved completely within 1 week of stent placement. No technical or clinical complications occurred. SVC syndrome recurred in one patient 2 months after stent placement and was treated by placing a second stent. CONCLUSION. Endovascular treatment with stent placement should be considered relevant and safe for refractory benign SVC syndrome. However, a larger series and a longer follow-up period are needed to define the role of stent placement for this syndrome.",Excluded
2136,"The prognosis of anaplastic astrocytoma with radiologic necrosis mimicking glioblastoma Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) sometimes shows a rapid poor course like glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated the prognosis of AA with radiologic necrosis which is the representative radiologic finding of glioblastoma. From 1995 to 2010, we operated on 26 patients who were confirmed to have AA. The male:female ratio was 13:13, and the median age was 47.23 years. The mean follow-up period was 3 years. We analyzed the prognostic significance of radiologic necrosis with age, sex, KPS, tumour location, radiologic findings, extent of removal and radiation therapy oncology group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG-RPA) classification. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 0.5 (+/-0.17) years and the median overall survival (OS) was 1.6 (+/-0.40) years. In univariate analysis, the clinical variables of younger age (p = 0.030) and RTOG-RPA class III (p = 0.043) correlated with longer PFS, and KPS (p = 0.038), radiologic necrosis (p = 0.013) and the extent of removal (p = 0.041) correlated with OS. The median OS was 1.0 (+/-0.21) year in AA with radiologic necrosis compared to AA without radiologic necrosis, which showed 2.1 (+/-0.29) years median OS. On multivariate analysis, there was no statistically significant prognostic factor. However, Cox's regression model revealed that gross total removal was associated with a longer OS (hazard ratio =0.136; 95% CI, 0.018 to 1.046; p = 0.055) compared to partial removal or biopsy. Gross total resection was associated with good prognosis, and AA with radiologic necrosis had poor prognosis like glioblastoma. © 2013 The Neurosurgical Foundation.",Excluded
1560,"X-irradiation removes endogenous primordial germ cells (PGCs) and increases germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are embryonic precursors of germline cells with potential applications in genetic conservation, transgenic animal production and germline stem cell research. These lines of research would benefit from improved germline transmission of transplanted PGCs in chimeric chickens. We therefore evaluated the effects of pretransplant X-irradiation of recipient embryos on the efficacy of germline transmission of donor PGCs in chimeric chickens. Intact chicken eggs were exposed to X-ray doses of 3, 6 and 9 Gy (dose rate = 0.12 Gy/min) after 52 h of incubation. There was no significant difference in hatching rate between the 3-Gy-irradiated group and the nonirradiated control group (40.0 vs. 69.6%), but the hatching rate in the 6-Gy-irradiated group (28.6%) was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.05). No embryos irradiated with 9 Gy of X-rays survived to hatching. X-irradiation significantly reduced the number of endogenous PGCs in the embryonic gonads at stage 27 in a dose-dependent manner compared with nonirradiated controls. The numbers of endogenous PGCs in the 3-, 6- and 9-Gy-irradiated groups were 21.0, 9.6 and 4.6% of the nonirradiated control numbers, respectively. Sets of 100 donor PGCs were subsequently transferred intravascularly into embryos irradiated with 3 Gy X-rays and nonirradiated control embryos. Genetic cross-test analysis revealed that the germline transmission rate in the 3-Gy-irradiated group was significantly higher than in the control group (27.5 vs. 5.6%; P<0.05). In conclusion, X-irradiation reduced the number of endogenous PGCs and increased the germline transmission of transferred PGCs in chimeric chickens.",Excluded
741,"Abdominal applications of 3.0-T MR imaging: comparative review versus a 1.5-T system With the development of dedicated receiver coils and increased gradient performance, 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) systems are gaining wider acceptance in clinical practice. The expected twofold increase in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with that of 1.5-T MR systems may help improve spatial resolution or increase temporal resolution when used with parallel acquisition techniques. Several issues must be considered when applying 3.0-T MR in the abdomen, including the alteration of the radiofrequency field and relaxation time, increase in energy deposition and susceptibility effects, and problems associated with motion artifacts. For the evaluation of liver lesions, higher SNR and greater resolution achieved with the 3.0-T system could translate into better detection of malignant lesions on T2-weighted images obtained with adjusted imaging parameters. For the evaluation of pancreatic and biliary diseases, high-resolution T2-weighted imaging using single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences is useful; improvement in SNR was noticeable on two-dimensional MR cholangiopancreatographic images. For the preoperative imaging of rectal cancer, a single-shot sequence is useful for dramatically decreasing imaging time while maintaining image quality. Substantial modification of examination protocols, with optimized imaging parameters and sequence designs along with ongoing development of hardware, could contribute to an increased role of the 3.0-T system for abdominal MR examinations.",Excluded
2478,"Therapeutic effect of linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy with a micro-multileaf collimator for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from lung cancer Objective: To assess the efficacy of hypofractionated linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy with a micro-multileaf collimator (mMLC) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Method(s): Seventy-eight lesions of brain metastases in 49 lung cancer patients treated by stereotactic radiotherapy between September 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. In the treatment planning, the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as an enhanced lesion plus 3 mm margin. A total dose of 39-42 Gy in three fractions was delivered to the isocenters of the PTV. Result(s): The median survival time after stereotactic radiotherapy was 17.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 61% and 32%, respectively. The presence of extracranial tumors, the pre-treatment performance status, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class were significant prognostic factors. The 1-and 2-year local recurrence rates were 14% and 17%, respectively, with no serious acute toxic effect. Injuries involving brain necrosis were observed in six patients. New brain metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis was seen in more than half of the patients following treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy. Conclusion(s): Hypofactionated stereotactic radiotherapy with mMLC is considered to be an effective and safe modality for the treatment of brain metastases in lung cancer patients. © The Author (2009).

978,"Salvage Gamma Knife Radiosurgery after failed management of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia Background: The incidence of bilateral trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is 1-6% of total number of TN cases. Gamma Knife Radiosurgery (GKRS) is effective in treating unilateral TN; however, outcomes of bilateral TN treated by GKRS have not been well evaluated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term GKRS outcomes of bilateral TN at our institution and compare with our published treatment outcomes of unilateral TN. Copyright:, Methods: Between 2000 and 2006, eight patients with bilateral TN were treated with GKRS. Data available on seven patients were collected. Facial pain outcomes were defined using the Barrow Neurological Institute pain intensity scale. Outcomes and toxicities were compared to published outcomes of unilateral TN patients treated with GKRS at our institution., Results: The incidence of bilateral TN in our series is 2.3%. Treatment outcomes were excellent in 5/14, good in 1/14, and poor in 8/14. Median follow-up time was 58 months. Median time-to-failure was 38 months. Pain control rate was 80% at 12 months and 65% at 36 months. Bothersome side effects were seen in 4/14 nerves treated. Compared with our long-term unilateral TN cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in outcome, time-to-failure, or rate of toxicity., Conclusion: Bilateral TN is rare, and effective treatment is crucial to improve the quality of life of those afflicted. Salvage GKRS is a reasonable treatment modality for individuals with bilateral TN.Copyright © 2014 Raval AB.",Excluded
141,"Quality of Life, Behaviour and Attitudes towards Actinic Keratosis in Spain: The PIQA Study OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to examine patients' knowledge, behaviours and attitudes regarding actinic keratosis (AK) lesions and the impact of the disease on patients' quality of life (QoL)., METHODS: Observational study of patients with AK lesions in Spain. QoL was evaluated with the validated version of Spanish AKQoL questionnaire. Skin self-examination, sun-exposure, habits and attitudes towards AK's treatment were recorded using different questionnaires. The adherence was assessed by means of the Morisky-Green test. Among other variables, QoL and adherence to treatment were compared by using Pearson's chi2 test and one-way ANOVA tests. Inferential analysis regarding such factors and length of treatment were also performed., RESULTS: A total of 1240 patients (73.6 [10.5] years old) were recruited. Overall, patients that showed higher levels of concern were also showed a higher impairment on QoL. AK had greater effects on women's QoL and those who performed skin self-examination, think that AK is a disease and/or believe that moisturizers can prevent skin aging (P<.05). Adherence and length of treatment were strongly related, since patients with treatments intended for <1week were more likely to show good adherence and complete remission of AK (Odds Ratio [95%CI]: 6.25 [4.55-8.33] and 2.63 [1.96-3.45]), respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Concerns due to AK are mainly related to sex and to the consideration of AK as a disease. More concerned patients tend to have lower QoL and good adherence to treatment. Short length of treatment was associated with better adherence and complete remission of AK lesions.

3336,"Schwann cell engraftment into injured peripheral nerve prevents changes in action potential properties Peripheral nerve injury results in changes in action potential waveform, ion channel organization, and firing properties of primary afferent neurons. It has been suggested that these changes are the result of reduction in basal trophic support from skin targets. Subcutaneous injections of Fluro-Gold (FG) in the hind limb of the rat were used to identify cutaneous primary afferent neurons. Five days after FG injection, sciatic nerves were ligated and encapsulated in a silicon tube allowing neuroma formation. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing Schwann cells (SCs) were injected proximal to the cut end of the nerve. Thirteen to 22 days after injury and SC injection, the L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were prepared for acute culture. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings in current clamp mode were obtained and action potential properties of medium-sized (34-45 microm) FG+ DRG neurons were characterized. In the neuroma group without cell transplantation, action potential duration and spike inflections were reduced as were the amplitude and duration of spike afterhyperpolarizations. These changes were not observed after transection by nerve crush where axons were allowed to regenerate to distal peripheral targets. In the transplantation group, GFP(+)-SCs were extensively distributed throughout the neuroma, and oriented longitudinally along axons proximal to the neuroma. Changes in action potential properties were attenuated in the GFP(+)-SC group. Thus the engrafted SC procedure ameliorated the changes in action potential waveform of cutaneous primary afferents associated with target disconnection and neuroma formation.",Excluded
906,"Impact of induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy on pulmonary function and postoperative acute respiratory complications in esophageal cancer Study objective: To evaluate the effects of induction concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) on pulmonary function and postoperative acute respiratory complications (PARCs). Design(s): A retrospective review of our patients treated with induction cCRT to determine the impact on pulmonary function and identify predictors of PARCs. Correlations were sought between patient demographics, clinical characteristics, pre-cCRT and post-cCRT pulmonary function, radiotherapy dose, chemotherapy agents, and the development of PARCs. Participant(s): One hundred fifty-five patients treated in three separate clinical trials were identified; 47 patients received 30 Gy (150 cGy bid) of radiation concurrently with a single course of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (5FU), and 108 patients received 45 Gy (150 cGy bid in a split course) concurrent with two courses of either cisplatin/5FU (n = 69) or cisplatin/paclitaxel (n = 39). Esophagectomy was performed in 141 of these 155 patients following cCRT. Result(s): cCRT was only associated with significant worsening of the diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), which decreased a median of 21.7% in the 45-Gy group (p = 0.007), and 8.6% in the 30-Gy group (p = 0.07). This DLCO decrease was statistically greater in the 45-Gy group than in the 30-Gy group (p = 0.02). PARCs developed in 18 patients. Percentage of predicted FEV1 and FVC, both before and after cCRT, were both significantly higher in patients without PARCs than in patients with PARCs (p = 0.031 and p = 0.010, respectively). Post-cCRT DLCO was also significantly worse in patients with PARCs (p = 0.002). PARCs occurred significantly more often among those treated with 45 Gy (17 of 102 patients) compared to those treated with 30 Gy (1 of 39 patients) [p = 0.025]. In the 18 patients with PARCs, the median survival was only 2.1 months. This was significantly less than the 16.4-month median survival in the 123 patients who did not have PARCs (p = 0.001). Conclusion(s): In patients treated with induction cCRT, higher radiation doses result in increasing impairment of gas exchange. PARCs were more likely in those patients with lower lung volumes, lower post-cCRT DLCO, and in those receiving higher radiation doses. These acute respiratory complications were also associated with a significant reduction in patient survival.",Excluded
3129,"The role of autophagy regulator LC3B in thyroid cancer cells response to metabolic stress and radiation Decreased expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), a well-characterized regulator of autophagy, has been shown to be associated with metastatic progression in patients with thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs. LC3B is involved in thyroid cancer cell resistance to metabolic and oxidative stressors. Decreased LC3B expression in undifferentiated thyroid cancer suggests that defective autophagy can contribute to thyroid cancer cell resistance to therapy.",Excluded

We explore the isthmus of the Eustachian tube (ET) as the key anatomic site for the prevention of radiation-induced otitis media with effusion., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eighty-two patients with NPC were divided into two groups: 40 patients treated with CRT and 42 patients treated with IMRT. The difference between dosage over the middle ear cavity and the isthmus of the ET was evaluated in both CRT group and IMRT group. All patients underwent hearing tests including pure tone audiometry and impedance audiometry before and after RT., RESULTS: The dosage difference to the middle ear cavity and isthmus between these two groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). The difference in hearing test results between these two groups was also statistically significant (p<0.05). If we limited the dose to the middle ear cavity under 34 Gy and the dose to the isthmus under 53 Gy with IMRT, we may decrease radiation-induced OME even with the larger 2.25 Gy fraction size., CONCLUSIONS: IMRT may have better protected the middle ear function compared with the CRT technique, even with larger fraction sizes than for the conventional CRT technique.",Excluded
3384,"Assessment of the degradation rates and effectiveness of different coated Mg-Zn-Ca alloy scaffolds for in vivo repair of critical-size bone defects Surgical repair of bone defects remains challenging, and the search for alternative procedures is ongoing. Devices made of Mg for bone repair have received much attention owing to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded
455,"Oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation The field of radiation biochemistry has provided tremendous impact in recent years as extensive research on free radicals has implicated them in radiation damage. An important offshoot of this field is the branch dealing with radiological protection in medical applications like diagnostic radiology. Hence, we decided to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and low dose ionizing radiation (x-rays) in the work environment of x-ray technicians (radiographers), by comparing their RBC malondialdehyde, % hemolysis, catalase and plasma vitamin E levels with those of controls. There was a significant increase in the susceptibility of RBCs to hemolysis in radiographers compared to controls. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were slightly increased in the radiographers, but this did not disturb the steady state concentration of their plasma vitamin E. These findings go in favour of theories stating that exposure to low dose ionizing radiation does cause a greater amount of oxidative stress, than that caused during normal routine metabolic processes.",Included

It is unclear whether PPIs change gastric volume or emptying. Aim(s): To assess the effect of a PPI, rabeprazole, on gastric volume and emptying and postprandial symptoms. Method(s): In a double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled trial, 13 healthy participants were randomized to rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., or placebo. On day 3, fasting gastric volume was measured using intravenous 99mTc- pertechnate and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). After the last dose of study medication, an 111In-chloride egg meal (300 kcal) was ingested, and postprandial gastric volume and emptying were measured by SPECT. Symptom ratings using a visual analogue scale (fullness, nausea, bloating, abdominal pain, aggregate score) were obtained at baseline and 15, 30, 45, 60 and 75 min postprandially. Group comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Result(s): There were no statistically significant differences in gastric volume or emptying in the two groups. However, there was a borderline increase in gastric volume with rabeprazole compared with placebo. Rabeprazole treatment reduced aggregate postprandial symptoms, particularly fullness, 30 min after the meal (P = 0.01). Conclusion(s): In healthy participants, rabeprazole, 20 mg b.d., did not significantly change gastric emptying, but reduced symptoms and had a borderline effect on gastric volume postprandially.

2187,"Ultraviolet polarisation sensitivity in the stomatopod crustacean Odontodactylus scyllarus The ommatidia of crustacean eyes typically contain two classes of photoreceptors with orthogonally oriented microvilli. These receptors provide the basis for two-channel polarisation vision in the blue-green spectrum. The retinae of gonodactyloid stomatopod crustaceans possess a great variety of structural specialisations for elaborate polarisation vision. One type of specialisation is found in the small, distally placed R8 cells within the two most ventral rows of the mid-band. These ultraviolet-sensitive photoreceptors produce parallel microvilli, a feature suggestive for polarisation-sensitive photoreceptors. Here, we show by means of intracellular recordings combined with dye-injections that in the gonodactyloid species Odontodactylus scyllarus, the R8 cells of mid-band rows 5 and 6 are sensitive to linear polarised ultraviolet light. We show that mid-band row 5 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented parallel to the mid-band, whereas mid-band row 6 R8 cells respond maximally to light with an e-vector oriented perpendicular to the mid-band. This orthogonal arrangement of ultraviolet-sensitive receptor cells could support ultraviolet polarisation vision. R8 cells of rows 5 and 6 are known to act as quarter-wave retarders around 500 nm and thus are the first photoreceptor type described with a potential dual role in polarisation vision.",Excluded
120,"Individualizing cancer treatment: biological optimization models in treatment planning and delivery PURPOSE: During the last 30 years radiation therapy has developed from classical rectangular beams via conformation therapy with largely uniform dose delivery, but irregular field shapes, to fully intensity modulated dose delivery where the total dose distribution in the tumor can be fully controlled in three dimensions. This last step has been developed during the last 15-20 years and has opened up the possibilities for truly optimized radiation therapy., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Today it is not only possible to produce almost any desired dose distribution in the tumor volume. It is also possible to deliver the dose distribution, which has the highest probability to cure the patient without inducing severe complications in normal tissues. To fully exploit the advantages of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, quality of life or radiobiologic objectives have to be used, preferably combined with predictive assay of radiation sensitivity., RESULTS: This article will briefly discuss the biologic objective functions and the associated advantages in the treatment outcome using new approaches such as consideration of stochastic variations in sensitivity and optimization of the angle of incidence and fractionation schedule with intensity-modulated beams. Finally, different possibilities for realizing general three-dimensional intensity-modulated dose delivery will be discussed., CONCLUSIONS: Once accurate genetically and/or cell survival based predictive assays become available, radiation therapy will become an exact science allowing truly individual optimization considering also the panorama of side-effects that the patient is willing to accept.",Excluded

Method(s): A total of 41 patients received neoadjuvant intent chemoradiation for esophageal cancer. Most patients had a locally advanced disease (T3/4: 82%, N+: 83%, M0: 100%) and squamous cell carcinoma (83%). All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin/5-fluorouracil or mitomycin/5-fluorouracil. Median radiation dose was 50.4Gy in the 25 patients who proceeded to surgery and 57.4Gy in 16 patients who did not undergo surgery. FDG-PET/CT was used for treatment planning in 24 patients. A second FDG-PET/CT was available for response evaluation in 18 patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 16 months in all patients and 30 months in survivors. Radiotherapy was completed without interruptions >3 days in 90% of patients, and chemotherapy was carried out to >80% in 85% of patients. The 2-year locoregional control rate was 60%, distant control rate 54% and overall survival rate 50%. Hematological toxicity grade 3/4 was observed in 34%/10% of patients and non-hematological toxicity grade 3/4 in 46%/2% of patients. Perioperative 30-day mortality was 4%. Subgroup analyses revealed that surgery significantly improved locoregional control (74% vs. 39%, p= 0.034), but not the 2-year survival rate (54% vs. 43%, p= 0.246). In contrast, response based on FDG-PET/CT prior and after chemoradiation significantly predicted improved overall survival (2-year overall survival 61% vs. 40%, p= 0.048).

3097,"Association Between Radiation Dose and Outcomes With Postoperative Radiotherapy for N0-N1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer PURPOSE: To review trends in the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the modern era for N0-N1 margin-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following surgical resection and evaluate the association between PORT dose and overall survival., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of nonmetastatic stage II and III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC surgically treated patients within the National Cancer Data Base from 2003 to 2011. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed for multivariable analyses of overall survival and PORT dose. Radiation modalities included nonconformal beam radiation, 3-dimensional conformal radiation (3D-CRT), and intensity-modulated radiation therapy., RESULTS: We identified 2167 (6.7%) and 30,269 (93.3%) patients with surgically resected stage II or III N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC who were treated with and without PORT, respectively. The proportion of patients treated with PORT (dose range, 45 to 74 Gy) decreased from 8.9% in 2003 to 2006 to 4.1% in 2010 to 2011. Among patients receiving PORT, the use of high-dose (60 to 74 Gy) PORT rose throughout the study period, starting at 34.8% in 2003 to 2006 and rising to 49.3% in 2010 to 2011.Overall, patients who received PORT had worse survival (hazards ratio=1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.40) compared with those not receiving PORT. This association was unchanged when limited to patients receiving modern treatment with 3-CRT or intensity-modulated radiation therapy (hazards ratio=1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.65)., CONCLUSIONS: The use of PORT for N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC decreased from 2003 to 2011. We found no evidence of benefit from PORT for resected N0-N1 margin-negative NSCLC, regardless of dose or technique. PORT should be approached with caution in this group of patients, regardless of radiotherapy technique.",Included
501,"Organ biodistribution of Germanium-68 in rat in the presence and absence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC for the extrapolation to the human organ and whole-body radiation dosimetry Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and in particular gallium-68 (68Ga) applications are growing exponentially worldwide contributing to the expansion of nuclear medicine and personalized management of patients. The significance of 68Ga utility is reflected in the implementation of European Pharmacopoeia monographs. However, there is one crucial point in the monographs that might limit the use of the generators and consequently expansion of 68Ga applications and that is the limit of 0.001% of Germanium-68 (68Ge(IV)) radioactivity content in a radiophar-maceutical. We have investigated the organ distribution of 68Ge(IV) in rat and estimated human dosimetry parameters in order to provide experimental evidence for the determination and justification of the 68Ge(IV) limit. Male and female rats were injected in the tail vein with formulated [68Ge]GeCl4 in the absence or presence of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. The tissue radioactivity distribution data was extrapolated for the estimation of human organ equivalent doses and total effective dose using Organ Level Internal Dose Assessment Code software (OLINDA/EXM). 68Ge(IV) was evenly distributed among the rat organs and fast renal excretion prevailed. Human organ equivalent dose and total effective dose estimates indicated that the kidneys were the dose-limiting organs (185+/-54 muSv/MBq for female and 171+/-38 muSv/MBq for male) and the total effective dose was 15.5+/-0.1 and 10.7+/-1.2 muSv/MBq, respectively for female and male. The results of this dosimetry study conclude that the 68Ge(IV) limit currently recommended by monographs could be increased considerably (>100 times) without exposing the patient to harm given the small absorbed doses to normal organs and fast excretion.",Excluded

Overall image quality was evaluated using a 4-point scale. Vascular enhancement (HU) was then assessed in each patient by manually drawing multiple ROIs in lumen of 7 segments of the whole aorta. The radiation dose exposure of both groups was calculated and all data were compared and statistically analyzed., RESULTS:: On low-kV protocol, higher mean attenuation values were achieved in all the measurements as compared to standard protocol. There were no significant differences in the image quality evaluation in both groups. Mean radiation dose value of study group was significantly lower than in control group (reduction of 20%)., CONCLUSION: : Low kV and low CM volume CTA protocols allow TAVI planning to be carried out with high quality images and a significant reduction in the radiation dose as compared to the standard CTA protocol., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: : Low-kV CTA for pre-operative assessment of patients candidates for TAVI, permits to achieve a significant reduction of radiation dose exposure and contrast medium volume, reducing the risk of contrast induced nephropathy.",Excluded
2880,"Extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria: a case series OBJECT When intracranial tumors invade the overlying skull, gross resection typically includes removal of the involved bone. Methods used to repair the resulting structural defect in the cranium include artificial prostheses, allogeneic bone grafts, and autoclaving the autologous graft. The authors have previously reported a case involving high-dose extracorporeal ionizing radiation to treat the tumorous calvaria intraoperatively, followed by reimplantation of the treated bone flap. In this paper the authors report the long-term follow-up of that case, as well as results of using extracorporeal irradiation of tumorous calvaria (EITC) for an additional 20 patients treated similarly. METHODS The decision to undergo EITC was typically anticipated preoperatively, but determined intraoperatively, if upon inspection the bone flap was invaded by tumor. The bone flap was then delivered to the radiation oncology department, where a total dose of 120 Gy was delivered, using a clinical linear accelerator, over a period of approximately 15 minutes. After the intracranial tumor resection was completed, the irradiated craniotomy bone flap was reimplanted and the wound was closed in a standard fashion. A retrospective review of patients who had undergone EITC was performed for evidence of calvarial tumor recurrence or other complications. RESULTS Since the originally reported case, 20 additional patients have received EITC during craniotomy for invasive tumors. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients were diagnosed with meningioma: 12 (67%) with WHO Grade I, 5 (28%) with WHO Grade II, and 1 with WHO Grade III (6%). The remaining 3 patients presented with dural-based B-cell lymphoma with extensive adjacent bone invasion (n = 2) and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung (n = 1). Follow-up of the 21 patients ranged from 1 to 132 months, with a mean of 41 months and a median of 23 months. No patients have experienced tumor recurrence, infection associated with the treated calvaria, or evidence of bone flap resorption. CONCLUSIONS Calvaria reconstructions represent an important component in structural and cosmetic outcome following craniectomy for tumorous bone. The authors' long-term experience with EITC has been excellent with no local tumor recurrence or complications. Therefore, EITC represents an excellent and efficient option for cranial reconstruction in such patients.",Excluded
1695,"The human leulocyte test system. VII. Further investigations concerning micronucleus-derived premature chromosome condensation Premature chromosome condensation (PCC) from X-ray induced micronuclei shows a dose-effect relationship in human leukocytes in vitro. Preparations at different culture times without colcemide treatment reveal complex variations of the frequencies of micronuclei and PCC correlated with the fixation time. The positions of PCC patches in the metaphase plate and the frequencies of different PCC types (S and G2) ar independent on the X-ray dose. The latter indicates that the slowing down of the micronuclei in the cell cycle, which is the reason for the formation of PCC, may be an outcome rather of a regulatory phenomenon than of an unspecific physiological damage of the chromatin included in the micronuclei. This is especially evident from labeling experiments with tritiated thymidine, showing that the extent of asynchrony between main nuclei and micronuclei is independent on the X-ray dose. Labeling experiments with tritiated uridine reveal a X-ray dose dependent suppression of RNA synthesis in cells with main nuclei and micronuclei. THE S-phase nature of ""pulverized"" PCC patches could be verified by incorporation of tritiated thymidine in aound 50%. Staining of centromeric heterochromatin in micronuclei reveal a frequency of micronuclei with centromeric heterochromatin resembling the frequency of G2-phase PCC found in mitoses.",Excluded
777,"Predictors of Late Cardiovascular Complications in Survivors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Long-term survival after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is now an expected outcome. The growing population of survivors is at risk of developing treatment-related complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD). A nested case-controlled design was used to identify clinical and treatment-related risk factors for development of late (1+ years after HCT) CVD. Cases were identified from a cohort of 1+-year survivors who underwent transplantation at City of Hope between 1977 and 2006. Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded
1320,"Reactive oxygen species and DNA damage after ultrasound exposure The aim of this work was to detect the formation of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals after ultrasound (US) exposure and test the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species induced by ultrasound can contribute to DNA damage. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed in incubated medium after sonication with 1 MHz continuous ultrasound at the intensities of 0.61-2.44 W/cm2. Free radicals and hydrogen peroxide produced by ultrasound exposure of cells can lead to DNA damage. Comet assay was used to assess the effect of ultrasound on the level of nuclear DNA damage. The nucleated erythrocytes from fish were exposed in vitro to ultrasound at the same intensities and frequency. It was noticed that ultrasound in all used intensities induced DNA damage. The effect was not eliminated by the addition of catalase, which indicates that DNA damage was not caused by hydrogen peroxide only. The results showed that the DNA damage can be repair and this mechanism was the most effective after 30 and 60 min after sonication. Furthermore, the ultrasound-induced DNA damage in the presence of sonosensitizer (Zn- and AlCl-phthalocyanine) was studied. It was noticed that phthalocyaniens (Pcs) alone or with ultrasound did not induce significant changes in the level of DNA damage. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2838,"Reproducibility of diaphragm position assessed with a voluntary breath-holding device Purpose: To evaluate the reproducibility of diaphragm position in our new breath-holding radiotherapy for abdominal tumors using image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and a voluntary breath-holding device, Abches. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients treated with abdominal tumors using IGRT with Abches were enrolled. Twenty patients without dementia or severe lung disease were analyzed. Each fraction of all patients was set up with kV cone-beam CT with reference to the vertebral bodies. Before daily treatment, electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images of the diaphragm at breath-holding exhale phase were acquired. The difference in the diaphragm position relative to the vertebral body was analyzed by comparing EPID images and the digitally reconstructed radiograph of the planning CT. We evaluated the reproducibility of two axes: superior-inferior (S-I) and right-left (R-L) with the EPID measurements. Result(s): The 443 irradiation data sets were analyzed. The interfractional reproducibility of the diaphragm relative to vertebral bodies was 1.7 +/- 1.4 mm in the S-I and 1.4 +/- 1.2 mm in the R-L direction.

Between August 1994 and December 1999, 63 patients with stage IIIA and stage IIIB non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with RT to a dose of 69.6 Gy at 1.2 Gy twice daily with daily cisplatin at 6 mg/m. Thirty-seven patients elected to receive consolidation carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy. Recurrence and survival outcomes were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Acute and late side effects were scored by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading system. Radiographic complete or partial tumor response was achieved in 34 of 63 (54%) of cases. Median absolute survival was 20.1 months. Median time to local recurrence and distant metastases were 10.6 and 8.6 months, respectively. Overall survival rates were 57%, 35%, and 23% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Survival was significantly greater for patients receiving consolidation chemotherapy (50% versus 20% at 3 years).

ED physicians and ED nurses were asked about the risks and the radiation doses of imaging methods ordered in the ED. The differences between the two groups were compared using Student's t-test for continuous variables. A Fisher's exact and Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables., RESULTS: A total of 82 ED physicians and 109 ED nurses completed the questionnaire; 38 (46.3%) physicians and 8 (7.3%) nurses correctly answered the question about the chest X-ray radiation dose. A question about the number of chest X-rays that is equivalent to the dose of a pelvic X-ray was answered correctly by 5 (6.1%) physicians and 9 (8.3%) nurses (P = 0.571). Questions regarding abdominal computed tomography (CT), chest CT, brain CT, abdominal ultrasonography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging were answered correctly more frequently by the physician group than the nurse group (P < 0.05). The risk of developing cancer over a lifetime due to a brain CT was correctly answered by 21 (25.6%) physicians and 30 (27.5%) nurses (P = 0.170). A similar question regarding abdominal CT was correctly answered by 21 (25.6%) physicians and 42 (38.5%) nurses (P = 0.127)., CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of the radiation exposure of radiology examinations was lower in nurses than physicians, but knowledge was poor in both groups.

Since June 2003, we have applied our conventional protocol for evaluation of cerebral blood perfusion during interventional radiology (IVR) procedures. We reviewed our experience using the IVR-CT/angio system and investigated the efficacy and limitations of this technique. No complications relating to radiation exposure, contrast medium use, or IVR procedures were observed. CT perfusion was useful for detecting cerebral perfusion impairment during IVR procedures. This was helpful in deciding the postoperative management. Because patients do not need to be transported to another radiographic suite to evaluate cerebral blood perfusion, the IVR-CT/angio system is ideal for safely and simply detecting cerebral perfusion defects during IVR procedures. However, it is important to consider whether there is sufficient indication for the procedure, because radiation exposure and the amount of contrast medium use are increased if the IVR procedures become difficult.",Excluded

2878,"Association between trunk and leg fat and incidence of diabetes Background: General obesity defined by body mass index (BMI) is a major risk factor of diabetes mellitus (DM). Although body fat distribution is also considered to be a predictor of DM, only a few longitudinal studies have examined the association between DM risk and body composition, estimated directly using such methods as DEXA, in particular with reference to Asian populations who have a higher prevalence of DM at lower BMI levels compared with CaucAsians. Objective(s): To determine whether fat distribution is associated with DM incidence, independently of BMI, in an elderly Japanese population. Method(s): We analyzed 1,550 subjects without DM (472 men and 1,078 women, average age of 65.3 years) in the Adult Health Study, consisting of atomic bomb survivors and their controls, whose body composition was measured using DEXA during the period 1994-96. Fat-mass percentages for the trunk and legs were calculated by dividing each of the specific body partTMs fat mass by total soft tissue mass. DM was defined as glucose 126mg/dl fasting or 200mg/dl nonfasting, or physician-diagnosed DM, or the use of medication for DM. We followed-up through the end of 2011. Result(s): During a mean follow-up period of 11.4 years, 85 men and 110 women developed DM. Almost 20% of men and 28% of women were overweight/obese (BMI25kg/m2) at baseline. After multivariate analysis with adjustment made for age, metabolic syndrome risk factors other than central obesity, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, only overweight/obese women had a significant association with DM incidence compared with non-obese women (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI 1.01-2.27). Percentages of trunk fat and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other, after adjustment for age, BMI, and other risk factors. Increased percentage of trunk fat was a significant risk factor for incidence of DM; the RR for 1% increase in trunk fat were 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.20) in men and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.14) in women, whereas, leg fat had protective effects regarding incidence of DM (men RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.96, women RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.79-0.95, for 1% increase in leg fat). These significant associations were observed for non-obese subjects. Conclusion(s): Trunk and leg fat were associated with incidence of DM, independently of each other. In addition to evaluation of general and abdominal obesity, the assessment of body fat distribution might also be useful in the prevention of DM.",Included

This study aims to describe the survival outcomes and toxicities associated with radioembolization for hepatic-predominant metastatic NET in a large single-institution cohort. Method(s): A total of 59 patients underwent radioembolization for metastatic NET with hepatic predominant disease at a single academic center. Patient outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and toxicities were detailed and described. Ten patients within the cohort underwent post-treatment dosimetric analysis using PET-MRI and normal liver dosimetry was correlated with hepatic fibrosis and toxicity. Result(s): Median overall survival from time of radioembolization in the patient cohort was 31 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival was 80.4% and 65.6% respectively. Median hepatic progression-free survival and overall progression-free survival were 18 and 13 months, respectively. Three patients died of hepatic failure that was possibly therapy-related. Ten patients underwent evaluation of post-treatment dosimetry following radioembolization. In patients who did not develop hepatotoxicity or hepatic fibrosis, mean dose to normal liver was 25.4 Gy, while the mean liver dose in patients who experienced toxicity (hepatic fibrosis in n=2 and death from hepatic failure in n=1) was 59.1 Gy. Conclusion(s): Overall survival following radioembolization for hepatic metastases from NET is excellent; however, deaths that are potentially treatment-related have been observed. Preliminary data regarding dose to normal liver is suggestive of a relation between dosimetry and toxicity, however further work is required to further elucidate the mechanism, correlation with dosimetry, as well as additional patient and tumor factors that may predispose these patients to toxicity.Copyright © Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

The objective of this study was to clarify the feasibility of CDDP + RT in Japanese patients. Patients and Methods: Patients with unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were given single daily fractionated radiation (70 Gy at 2 Gy/day) and chemotherapy consisting of a 2 h infusion of CDDP 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22 and 43. The primary endpoint was the rate of completion of CDDP + RT. Result(s): Between November 2005 and January 2007, 20 patients were enrolled, 19 males and one female with a median age of 61.5 years (range 50-74). One patient had recurrent unresectable disease after surgery and the remaining 19 had stage IV disease. No grade 4 hematologic toxicities were observed. The incidence of grade 3 mucositis was 55% and no treatment-related death occurred. Full-dose irradiation was performed in all patients, with a median duration of radiotherapy of 50 days (range 48-54). Although all patients received the first two administrations of CDDP, the third dose was administed in 17 patients (85%). The rate of completion of CDDP + RT was 85% and the dose intensity of CDDP was 28.9 mg/m2/week (relative dose intensity 89%). Overall complete response rate was 50% and the rate of primary complete response was 90%.

933,"Construction of a radiation hybrid panel and the first yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) radiation hybrid map using a nanofluidic dynamic array BACKGROUND: Yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) are an economically important species in Japan. However, there are currently no methods for captive breeding and early rearing for yellowtail. Thus, the commercial cultivation of this species is reliant upon the capture of wild immature fish. Given this, there is a need to develop captive breeding techniques to reduce pressure on wild stocks and facilitate the sustainable development of yellowtail aquaculture. We constructed a whole genome radiation hybrid (RH) panel for yellowtail gene mapping and developed a framework physical map using a nanofluidic dynamic array to use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for the DNA-assisted breeding of yellowtail., RESULTS: Clonal RH cell lines were obtained after ionizing radiation; specifically, 78, 64, 129, 55, 42, and 53 clones were isolated after treatment with 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 8,000, or 10,000 rads, respectively. A total of 421 hybrid cell lines were obtained by fusion with mouse B78 cells. Ninety-four microsatellite markers used in the genetic linkage map were genotyped using the 421 hybrid cell lines. Based upon marker retention and genome coverage, we selected 93 hybrid cell lines to form an RH panel. Importantly, we performed the first genotyping of yellowtail markers in an RH panel using a nanofluidic dynamic array (Fluidigm, CA, USA). Then, 580 markers containing ESTs and SNPs were mapped in the first yellowtail RH map., CONCLUSIONS: We successfully developed a yellowtail RH panel to facilitate the localization of markers. Using this, a framework RH map was constructed with 580 markers. This high-density physical map will serve as a useful tool for the identification of genes related to important breeding traits using genetic structural information, such as conserved synteny. Moreover, in a comparison of 30 sequences in the RH group 1 (SQ1), yellowtail appeared to be evolutionarily closer to medaka and the green-spotted pufferfish than to zebrafish. We suggest that synteny analysis may be potentially useful as a tool to investigate chromosomal evolution by comparison with model fish.",Excluded
708,"Uranium in drinking water: Renal effects of long-term ingestion by an aboriginal community The authors conducted a study of an aboriginal community to determine if kidney func-tion had been affected by the chronic ingestion of uranium in drinking water from the community's drilled wells. Uranium concentrations in drinking water varied from < 1 to 845 ppb. This nonin-vasive study relied on the measurement of a combination of urinary indicators of kidney function and markers for cell toxicity. In all, 54 individuals (12-73 years old) participated in the study. Correlation of uranium excreted in urine with bio-indicators at p <=.05 indicated interference with the kidney's reabsorptive function. Because of the community's concerns regarding cancer incidence, the authors also calculated cumulative radiation doses using uranium intake in drinking water over the preceding 15-year period. The highest total uranium intake over this period was 1,761 mg. The risk of cancer from the highest dose, 2.1 mSv, is 13 in 100,000, which would be difficult to detect in the community studied (population size = 1,480). This study indicates that at the observed levels of uranium intake, chemical toxicity would be a greater health concern than would radiation dose. © 2009 Heldref Publications.",Included

The field-specific PTV including range margins for PT was 1.5 (median, 25-75% 1.3-2.1) times larger than for SBRT. Nevertheless, maximum point dose and mean dose in OARs were higher in SBRT by 2.8 (1.6-3.7) Gy and 0.7 (0.3-1.6) Gy, respectively. Patients with a CTV >2.5 cc or with multiple lung lesions showed larger differences in OAR doses in favor of PT. Conclusions Patients receive less dose in critical OARs such as heart, spinal cord, esophagus, trachea and aorta with PT, while maintaining the same target coverage. Patients with multiple or larger lesions are particularly suited for PT.Copyright © 2016 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
867,"18F-fluorocholine versus 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose for PET/CT imaging in patients with suspected relapsing or progressive multiple myeloma: a pilot study Purpose: Hybrid positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has now become available, as well as whole-body, low-dose multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The radioactive glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely used tracer but has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting multiple myeloma (MM). We compared FDG with a more recent metabolic tracer, 18F-fluorocholine (FCH), for the detection of MM lesions at time of disease relapse or progression. Method(s): We analyzed the results of FDG and FCH imaging in 21 MM patients undergoing PET/CT for suspected relapsing or progressive MM. For each patient and each tracer, an on-site reader and a masked reader independently determined the number of intraosseous and extraosseous foci of tracer and the intensity of uptake as measured by their SUVmax and the corresponding target/non-target ratio (T/NT). Result(s): In the skeleton of 21 patients, no foci were found for two cases, uncountable foci were observed in four patients, including some mismatched FCH/FDG foci. In the 15 patients with countable bone foci, the on-site reader detected 72 FDG foci vs. 127 FCH foci (+76 %), whereas the masked reader detected 69 FDG foci vs. 121 FCH foci (+75 %), both differences being significant. Interobserver agreement on the total number of bone foci was very high, with a kappa coefficient of 0.81 for FDG and 0.89 for FCH. Measurement of uptake in the matched foci that took up both tracers revealed a significantly higher median SUVmax and T/NT for FCH vs. FDG. Almost all unmatched foci were FCH-positive FDG-negative (57/59 = 97 % on-site and 56/60 = 93 % on masked reading); they were more frequently observed than matched foci in the head and neck region. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PET/CT performed for suspected relapsing or progressive MM would reveal more lesions when using FCH rather than FDG.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
2778,"Radiation dose values for various coronary calcium scoring protocols in dual-source CT PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the radiation dose and associated image noise of previously suggested calcium scoring protocols using dual-source CT., METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients underwent coronary calcium scoring using dual-source CT. Patients were randomly assigned to five different protocols: retrospective ECG-gating and tube current reduction to 4% outside the pulsing window at 120 (protocol A) and 100 kV (B), prospective ECG-triggering at 120 (C) and 100 kV (D), and prospective ECG-triggering at 100 kV with attenuation-based tube current modulation (E). Radiation dose parameters and image noise were determined and compared., RESULTS: Protocol A resulted in an effective dose of 1.3 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol B in 0.8 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol C in 1.0 +/- 0.2 mSv, protocol D in 0.6 +/- 0.1 mSv, and protocol E in 0.7 +/- 0.1 mSv. Effective doses were significantly lower (P < 0.001) with 100 kV when compared to 120 kV protocols, and were significantly lower (P < 0.001) for prospective versus retrospective ECG-gating. No significant difference was found between protocol D and E. Significant negative correlations were found between the CTDI(vol) and heart rate for both retrospective ECG-gating protocols (protocol A: r = -0.98, P < 0.001; protocol B: r = -0.83, P < 0.001). The mean image noise was 29.0 +/- 6.7 HU, with no significant differences between the five protocols. The image noise was significantly correlated with the body weight (r = 0.21, P < 0.05) and BMI (r = 0.31, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Effective dose of calcium scoring using dual-source CT ranges from 0.6 to 1.3 mSv. Prospective triggering and lower tube voltage significantly reduces the radiation but yield similar image noise.",Excluded
1974,"Health status of Greek thyroid cancer patients after radioiodine administration compared to a demographically matched general population sample The impact of radioiodine-131 (131I) treatment on thyroid cancer patients' quality of life is controversial. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 60 patients aged 18-73 years old who had recently underwent near total thyroidectomy due to papillary thyroid cancer and were scheduled for 131I treatment. On admission to our department, prior to 131I administration patients underwent clinical and laboratory investigation including routine clinical biochemistry, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroglobulin (Tg) measurements. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was estimated by the SF- 36 Health Survey a generic instrument which consisted from eight scales (four for physical and four for mental health). After 131I administration patients were discharged and approximately 6 months later they were re-evaluated. Our results showed that HRQoL in thyroid cancer patients receiving 131I treatment is independent of age/ gender and thyroid cancer-related variables. All SF-36 scales significantly improved six months after administration (P<0.05). Compared to Greek general population, before 131I administration all scales were significantly lower (P<0.05). Six months post 131I administration, scales were significantly lower for physical functioning (P=0.02), physical role (P=0.01), social functioning (P=0.03) and emotional role limitations (P=0.04), whereas the remaining SF-36 scales were comparable to the general population. In conclusion, hypothyroidism and anxiety for the outcome of their disease before 131I treatment exert a negative impact on thyroid cancer patients. Quality of life improvement post 131I is mainly attributed to the resumption of euthyroidism and familiarization with treatment and follow-up procedures rather than 131I treatment itself. There was no significant difference between patients receiving lower (2220-3700MBq) and higher (3700-7400MBq) dosage.",Excluded
954,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded
1152,"Gamma-radiation sensitivity and polymorphisms in RAD51L1 modulate glioma risk BACKGROUND: DNA strand breaks pose the greatest threat to genomic stability. Genetically determined mutagen sensitivity predisposes individuals to a variety of cancers, including glioma. However, polymorphisms in DNA strand break repair genes that may determine mutagen sensitivity are not well studied in cancer risk, especially in gliomas., METHODS: We correlated genotype data for tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of DNA strand break repair genes with a gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity phenotype [expressed as mean breaks per cell (B/C)] in samples from 426 glioma patients. We also conducted analysis to assess joint and haplotype effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on mutagen sensitivity. We further validate our results in an independent external control group totaling 662 subjects., RESULTS: Of the 392 tSNPs examined, we found that mutagen sensitivity was modified by one tSNP in the EME2 gene and six tSNPs in the RAD51L1 gene (P < 0.01). Among the six RAD51L1 SNPs tested in the validation set, one (RAD51L1 rs2180611) was significantly associated with mutagen sensitivity (P = 0.025). Moreover, we found a significant dose-response relationship between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse tSNP genotypes. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed that RAD51L1 haplotypes F-A (zero adverse allele) and F-E (six adverse alleles) exhibited the lowest (0.42) and highest (0.93) mean B/C values, respectively. A similar dose-response relationship also existed between the mutagen sensitivity and the number of adverse haplotypes., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that polymorphisms in and haplotypes of the RAD51L1 gene, which is involved in the double-strand break repair pathway, modulate gamma-radiation-induced mutagen sensitivity.",Included
1674,"A randomized study to assess the effectiveness of orally administered pilocarpine during and after radiotherapy of head and neck cancer BACKGROUND: This prospective randomized study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of oral pilocarpine chloratum (Salagen) during and after radiotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between October 1999 and December 2003, 66 patients received 60 Gy of irradiation to their head and neck cancer. Half of the patients received 5 mg oral pilocarpine 3 times a day from the beginning of radiotherapy over a period of 12 weeks. The control group received similar doses of pilocarpine only in the second 6 weeks following irradiation. Patient saliva secretion was recorded, and a visual analog scale measuring overall and daily xerostomia, difficulty in sleeping, speaking, eating and wearing dentures was employed., RESULTS: Pilocarpine, given concomitantly with radiotherapy, statistically improved the salivary flow and induced better patient comfort by the end of radiotherapy. Patient comfort and symptoms related to xerostomia greatly decreased compared to patients receiving pilocarpine after irradiation in the second 6-week period of therapy. The patients' quality of life, saliva production and symptoms related to xerostomia showed significant progress by the end of the 12 weeks., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that stimulated salivary glands suffer less decrease in saliva production during radiotherapy. The stimulated saliva flow reduced the side-effects of irradiation.",Excluded
465,"Lack of correlation between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin The relationship between basal cell survival and gross response in irradiated swine skin was tested by comparing dose survival curves derived from time-dose isoeffect data with curves obtained directly from basal cell counts in histological sections. Assuming equal effect per exposure and constant cell survival at isoeffect, best-fitting single-hit multi-target and linear-quadratic response curves were determined for time-dose schedules resulting in non-healing of 50% of irradiated fields. Basal cell survivals for single doses of 970, 1649, 2231, and 2619 rad were estimated 1) by counting regenerating islands and 2) by monitoring total basal cell counts through time. The dose survival curve derived from the isoeffect data was steeper than the curve obtained from direct basal cell counts. Furthermore, the direct basal cell survival curve extrapolates to less than 100% at zero dose, indicating the presence of a resistant basal cell subpopulation. The data show that the isoeffect in this case is not strongly coupled to basal cell survival. Rather, the probability of healing of an irradiated field is more sensitive to the dose per fraction than is basal cell survival, implying a contribution to non-healing from damage to stromal elements such as the capillary endothelium.",Included
2895,"Pulmonary venous anatomy imaging with low-dose, prospectively ECG-triggered, high-pitch 128-slice dual-source computed tomography BACKGROUND: The efforts to reduce radiation from cardiac computed tomography (CT) are essential. Using a prospectively triggered, high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, we aim to determine the radiation dose and image quality in patients undergoing pulmonary vein (PV) imaging., METHODS AND RESULTS: In 94 patients (61+/-9 years; 71% male) who underwent 128-slice dual-source CT (pitch 3.4), radiation dose and image quality were assessed and compared between 69 patients with sinus rhythm and 25 patients with atrial fibrillation. Radiation dose was compared in a subset of 19 patients with prior retrospective or prospectively triggered CT PV scans without high pitch. In a subset of 18 patients with prior magnetic resonance imaging for PV assessment, PV anatomy and scan duration were compared with high-pitch CT. Using the high-pitch protocol, total effective radiation dose was 1.4 (1.3, 1.9) mSv, with no difference between sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation (1.4 versus 1.5 mSv; P=0.22). No high-pitch CT scans were nondiagnostic or had poor image quality. Radiation dose was reduced with high-pitch (1.6 mSv) compared with standard protocols (19.3 mSv; P<0.0001). This radiation dose reduction was seen with sinus rhythm (1.5 versus 16.7 mSv; P<0.0001) but was more profound with atrial fibrillation (1.9 versus 27.7 mSv; P=0.039). There was excellent agreement of PV anatomy (kappa 0.84; P<0.0001) and a shorter CT scan duration (6 minutes) compared with magnetic resonance imaging (41 minutes; P<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Using a high-pitch dual-source CT protocol, PV imaging can be performed with minimal radiation dose, short scan acquisition, and excellent image quality in patients with sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation. This protocol highlights the success of new cardiac CT technology to minimize radiation exposure, giving clinicians a new low-dose imaging alternative to assess PV anatomy.",Excluded
3426,"Radio-guided localization of a small pulmonary nodules during thoracoscopic resection Introduction: Today Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) is the procedure to prefer for diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary nodules. However, small or not peripheral nodules can be invisible or impalpable during toracoscopy, so difficult to localized. Many techniques have been developed to solve such problem. Herein we report our 13-years experience with Radio-guided One. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with pulmonary nodules smaller than 1cm and/or deeper, below the visceral pleura, underwent CT-guided injection, into the nodule a solution composed by 0,2 ml 99Tc- labelled human serum albumin microsphers and 0,1 ml non-ionic contrast. Then, during the toracoscopic procedure, a 11 mm diameter-collimated probe connected to a gamma ray detector is introduced to scan the lung surface. The area of major radioactivity is resected. Result(s): From 1997 to 2009, 450 patients underwent toracoscopic resection of a small pulmonary nodules, 155 with the radio-guided technique. The patients were men and women, with average age of 60,6 (range: 12-83). Mean duration of surgical procedure was 43 min (range: 20 -100). The procedure was successful in 150/155 cases. Five cases (3,2%) required conversion to minithoracotomy approach. The mean length of pleural dreinage and hospital stay was 2,3 and 4 respectively. Histological examination showed 75 benign lesions and 80 malignant lesions (43 metastasis and 37 primary lung cancers).

570,"Accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography with prospective ECG-triggering Purpose: To evaluate the accuracy of low dose CT coronary angiography (CTCA) using prospective ECG-triggering for the assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Method(s): Thirty patients (19 male, 11 female, mean age 58.8+/-9.9 years) underwent low dose CTCA and invasive coronary angiography (CA) (median 2 days (0, 41)). Before CT scanning, intravenous beta-blocker was administered in 18/30 patients as heart rate (HR) was >65 beats per minute (bpm), achieving a mean HR of 55.7+/-7.9 bpm. CAD was defined as coronary artery narrowing >=50%, using CA as standard of reference. On an intention-to-diagnose-base all non-evaluative segments were included in the analysis. Vessels with a non-evaluative segment and no further finding were censored as false positive. Result(s): The estimated mean effective radiation dose was 2.1+/-0.7 mSv (range: 1.0 - 3.3), yielding 96.0% (383/399) of evaluable segments. Patient based analysis revealed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, 83.3%, 90.0%, and 100%.

689,"Expression of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells modulates the responsive to irradiation treatment Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is highly sensitive to irradiation treatment. Expression of Epstein-Barr virus gene products will affect the radiosensitivity of the cancer cells. Here, the association between EBV BamH1-A rightward transcript 7 microRNA (ebv-miR-BART7) and the effects on irradiation sensitivity was explored. Methods Tissue ebv-miR-BART7 expression level was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells with ebv-miR-BART7 expression was evaluated by colony formation assay, cell proliferation assay, apoptosis assay, H2AX phosphorylation staining and acridine orange staining. In addition, xenograft model was developed using zebrafish embryo to validate the in vivo radiation sensitivity of the ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC. Results Primary NPC tissues and recurrent NPC tissues had a significant higher ebv-miR-BART7 level in comparison with the corresponding normal counterparts. ebv-miR-BART7-expressing NPC cells had higher sensitivity to irradiation treatment. Conclusion Our results suggested that NPC patients have an elevated ebv-miR-BART expression in the primary NPC and recurrent NPC tissue. High ebv-miR-BART increases the sensitivity of NPC cells to irradiation treatment. Further investigation on the clinical value of ebv-miR-BART7 to the therapeutic response is warranted to evaluate the potential use of ebv-miR-BART7 as molecular biomarker in monitoring NPC patients.",Included
2829,"Melanocortin 1 Receptor-Targeted alpha-Particle Therapy for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma New effective therapies are greatly needed for metastatic uveal melanoma, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 y. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanoma metastases, and a MC1R-specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R was previously developed. Methods: The 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL conjugate was synthesized in high radiochemical yield and purity and was tested in vitro for biostability and for MC1R-specific cytotoxicity in uveal melanoma cells, and the lanthanum-DOTA-MC1RL analog was tested for binding affinity. Non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were tested for maximum tolerated dose and biodistribution. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing uveal melanoma tumors or engineered MC1R-positive and -negative tumors were studied for biodistribution and efficacy. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using mouse biodistribution data and blood clearance kinetics from Sprague-Dawley rat data. Results: High biostability, MC1R-specific cytotoxicity, and high binding affinity were observed. Limiting toxicities were not observed at even the highest administered activities. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance (<15 min), renal and hepatobillary excretion, MC1R-specific tumor uptake, and minimal retention in other normal tissues. Radiation dosimetry calculations determined pharmacokinetics parameters and absorbed alpha-emission dosages from 225Ac and its daughters. Efficacy studies demonstrated significantly prolonged survival and decreased metastasis burden after a single administration of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL in treated mice relative to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest significant potential for the clinical translation of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL as a novel therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.

2643,"Noonan syndrome and glioneuronal tumors: A central nervous system cancer predisposition association? BACKGROUND: Noonan syndrome (NS) is associated with germline Ras signaling pathway mutations, RAS overactivation and increased tumorigenesis risk. Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors (RFGT) are rare indolent tumors. We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT. PATIENT 1: A 22-year-old male with NS was diagnosed with RFGT after partial tumor resection followed by focal irradiation. He was enrolled on a comprehensive genomic profiling study involving paired tumor-normal whole exome sequencing and RNA sequencing of the disease-involved tissue, revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Gly60Ala) consistent with NS, and a somatic deletion (p.Ile442-Thr454del) in PIK3R1 and a somatic variant (p.Lys656Glu) in FGFR1 with concomitant increased expression of PIK3R1 and FGFR1 by RNA-sequencing. The patient remains without tumor progression now nine months since irradiation. PATIENT 2: A 19-year-old male with persistent headaches, underwent a brain MRI demonstrated multiple abnormal signals in the pineal region and midbrain. He had a stereotactic biopsy revealing RFGT. He was enrolled on the genomic study revealing a germline PTPN11 alteration (p.Asn308Asp) resulting in a new diagnosis of NS. Several family members were subsequently identified with clinical features of NS, including his mother and two siblings, enabling appropriate counseling. Two somatic variants were found in trans in PIK3R1 (p.Thr454-Phe456del and p.Glu451-Asn453delinsAsp), and a somatic variant (p.Val695Met) in FGFR1, with resultant overexpression of PIK3R1. The patient is monitored with surveillance imaging. CONCLUSION(S): We report the molecular profiling of two patients with NS and RFGT; strongly suggesting their connection to RASopathies through the overactivation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.",Excluded

While MTG16 loss renders mice sensitive to chemicalcolitis, the role of MTG16 in the small intestine is unknown. Histologicalexamination revealed that Mtg16-/- mice have increasedenterocyte proliferation and goblet cell deficiency. After exposure toradiation, Mtg16-/- mice exhibited increased crypt viability anddecreased apoptosis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometricand immunofluorescence analysis of intestinal epithelial cellsfor phospho-histone H2A.X also indicated decreased DNA damageand apoptosis in Mtg16-/- intestines. To determine if Mtg16 deletionaffected epithelial cells in a cell-autonomous fashion, intestinal cryptswere isolated from Mtg16-/- mice. Mtg16-/-and WT intestinalcrypts showed similar enterosphere forming efficiencies when culturedin the presence of EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin. However, whenMtg16-/- crypts were cultured in the presence of Wnt3a, theydemonstrated higher enterosphere forming efficiencies and delayedprogression to mature enteroids. Mtg16-/- intestinal crypts isolatedfrom irradiated mice exhibited increased survival compared with WTintestinal crypts. Interestingly, Mtg16 expression was reduced in astem cell-enriched population at the time of crypt regeneration. Thisis consistent with MTG16 negatively regulating regeneration in vivo.Taken together, our data demonstrate that MTG16 loss promotesradioresistance and impacts intestinal stem cell function, possibly dueto shifting cellular response away from DNA damage-induced apoptosisand towards DNA repair after injury.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Included

1749,"Interventional cardiologists and risk of radiation-induced cataract: results of a French multicenter observational study BACKGROUND: Interventional cardiologists (ICs) are exposed to X-rays and may be at risk to develop cataract earlier than common senile cataract. Excess risk of posterior subcapsular cataract, known as radiation-induced, was previously observed in samples of ICs from Malaysia, and Latin America. The O'CLOC study (Occupational Cataracts and Lens Opacities in interventional Cardiology) was performed to quantify the risk at the scale of France., METHODS: This cross-sectional multicenter study included an exposed group of ICs from different French centers and an unexposed control group of non-medical workers. Individual information was collected about cataract risk factors and past and present workload in catheterization laboratory. All participants had a clinical eye examination to classify the lens opacities (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapsular) with the international standard classification LOCS III., RESULTS: The study included 106 ICs (mean age = 51 +/- 7 years) and 99 unexposed control subjects (mean age = 50 +/- 7 years). The groups did not differ significantly in the prevalence of either nuclear or cortical lens opacities (61% vs. 69% and 23% vs. 29%, respectively). However, posterior subcapsular lens opacities, were significantly more frequent among ICs (17% vs. 5%, p=0.006), for an OR=3.9 [1.3-11.4]. The risk increased with duration of activity but no clear relationship with workload was observed. However, the risk appeared lower for regular users of protective lead glasses (OR=2.2 [0.4-12.8])., CONCLUSIONS: ICs, in France as elsewhere, are at high risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts. Use of protective equipment against X-rays, in particular lead glasses, is strongly recommended to limit this risk. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Included

Method(s): Eighty-eight studies on 84 patients underwent pelvic and lower-extremity CT venography under protocol A (standard 120 kV with 150 mL of contrast material, n = 44) or protocol B (80 kV with 100 mL of contrast material, n = 44) on a 64-detector CT scanner. We compared the dose length product in the 2 protocols. Two blinded observers measured CT attenuation in the veins, the image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio, and figure of merit. Result(s): The mean dose length product was significantly lower under protocol B than A (603.2 [SD, 67.2] vs 1131.7 [SD, 67.0] mGy x cm) (P < 0.01).

SD series were reconstructed using FBP. RD series were reconstructed with FBP, ASIR, and MBIR (Veo). Three readers-blinded to clinical history and comparison studies-reviewed all series, identifying liver lesions >=4 mm. Non-blinded review by two experienced abdominal radiologists-assessing SD against available clinical and radiologic information-established the reference standard., RESULTS: RD-CECT mean effective dose was 2.01 +/- 1.36 mSv (median, 1.71), a 64.1 +/- 8.8 % reduction. Pooled per-patient performance data were (sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV/accuracy) 0.91/0.78/0.60/0.96/0.81 for SD-FBP compared with RD-FBP 0.79/0.75/0.54/0.91/0.76; RD-ASIR 0.84/0.75/0.56/0.93/0.78; and RD-MBIR 0.84/0.68/0.49/0.92/0.72. ROC AUC values were 0.896/0.834/0.858/0.854 for SD-FBP/RD-FBP/RD-ASIR/RD-MBIR, respectively. RD-FBP (P = 0.002) and RD-MBIR (P = 0.032) AUCs were significantly lower than those of SD-FBP; RD-ASIR was not (P = 0.052). Reader confidence was lower for all RD series (P < 0.001) compared with SD-FBP, especially when calling patients entirely negative., CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive CT dose reduction resulted in inferior diagnostic performance and reader confidence for detection of low-contrast liver lesions compared to SD. Relative to RD-ASIR, RD-FBP showed decreased sensitivity and RD-MBIR showed decreased specificity., KEY POINTS: * Reduced-dose CECT demonstrates inferior diagnostic performance for detecting low-contrast liver lesions. * Reader confidence is lower with reduced-dose CECT compared to standard-dose CECT. * Overly aggressive dose reduction may result in misdiagnosis, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. * Careful consideration of perceived risks versus benefits of dose reduction is crucial.",Excluded

Eight months after initial surgery the microimplants were retrieved with a surrounding bone core. The composition of residual graft material and surrounding bone was analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy., RESULTS: Residual graft material of both types was present as 10-500 mum particles in direct contact with, or completely surrounded by, newly formed bone; smaller particles were also present in non-mineralized tissue. In the case of BCP the bone-graft substitute interface showed evidence of superficial disintegration of particles into individual grains. Median Ca/P ratios (at.%), determined from >200 discreet sites within residual graft particles and adjacent bone, were: DBB: 1.61 (confidence interval [CI] 1.59-1.64); BCP: 1.5 (CI 1.45-1.52); DBB-augmented bone: 1.62 (CI 1.59-1.66); BCP-augmented bone: 1.52 (CI 1.47-1.55); P=0.028 for DBB vs. BCP and DBB- vs. BCP-augmented bone. The reduction in Ca/P ratio for BCP over the healing period is consistent with the dissolution of beta-TCP and reprecipitation on the surface of calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite., CONCLUSION: The beta-TCP component of BCP may be gradually substituted by calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite over the healing period. This process and superficial degranulation of BCP particles may influence the progress of resorption and healing.",Excluded
2355,"Effectiveness and limitations of human identification from cremains: A report of two cases The present study of two case reports of the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake demonstrates the effectiveness and limitations of using dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging of cremains as a means of identification. In case 1, identification was assisted by further expanding the age range of the cremains evaluated on macroscopy by obtaining CBCT images of the cremated maxilla. The findings of case 2 presented the possibility that the deceased and the candidate were the same person by superimposing the CBCT images of the cremated patella on the X-ray of the candidate. However, since cremated bones are deformed to varying degrees, it is clear that the images obtained before, rather than after, cremation are more effective in comparing post-mortem and ante-mortem images. Thus, it is necessary to collect extensive and diverse data on the deceased before cremation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
1776,"Treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with image-guided high-dose rate, interstitial brachytherapy as second-line or salvage therapy PURPOSE We aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of image-guided high-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy (iBT) for the treatment of patients with hepatic, lymphatic, and pancreatic metastases originating from gastric cancer, an entity rarely surgically treatable with curative intent. METHODS Twelve patients with a cumulative number of 36 metastases (29 liver, 2 pancreatic, 5 lymph node) from histologically proven gastric adenocarcinoma received iBT between 2010 and 2016 and were retrospectively analyzed. Every patient underwent palliative chemotherapy prior to iBT. The iBT procedure employs a temporarily, intratumorally placed iridium-192 source in a single fraction with the goal of tumor cell eradication. Effectiveness was assessed clinically and by radiologic imaging every three months. RESULTS Local tumor control was achieved in 32 of all treated metastases (89%). Four lesions showed a local recurrence after 7 months. Lesion sizes varied from 9 to 102 mm with a median of 20 mm. The median progression-free survival was 6.6 months (range, 1.8-46.8 months). The median overall survival was 11.4 months (range, 5-47 months). One patient suffered a major complication following iBT, hepatic hematoma and abscess (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3), successfully dealt with by transcutaneous drainage. CONCLUSION iBT is an overall safe procedure, which facilitates high rates of local tumor control in treatment of metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. Compared with surgical metastasectomy, similar overall survival rates could be achieved in our patient collective after iBT application.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded
1545,"Carbon ion radiotherapy for oligo-recurrent lung metastases from colorectal cancer: A feasibility study Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for oligo-recurrent lung tumors from colorectal cancer (CRC). Method(s): From May 1997 to October 2012, 34 consecutive patients with oligo-recurrent pulmonary metastases from CRC were treated with CIRT. The patients were not surgical candidates for medical reasons or patient refusal. Using a respiratory-gated technique, carbon ion therapy was delivered with curative intent using 4 coplanar beam angles. A median dose of 60 GyE (range, 44-64.8 GyE) was delivered to the planning target volume (PTV), with a median daily dose of 15 GyE (range, 3.6-44 GyE). Treatment outcome was analyzed in terms of local control rate (LCR), survival rate, and treatment-related complications. Result(s): In total, 34 patients with 44 oligo-recurrent pulmonary lesions were treated with CIRT. Median follow-up period was 23.7 months. The 2- and 3-year actuarial LCRs of the treated patients were 85.4% +/- 6.2% and 85.4% +/- 6.2%, respectively. Overall survival was 65.1% +/- 9.5% at 2 years, and 50.1% +/- 10.5% at 3 years. Although survival rates were relatively worse in the subsets of patients aged < 63 years or with early metastasis (< 36 months after resection of primary site), these factors were not significantly correlated with overall survival (P = 0.13 and 0.19, respectively). All treatment-related complications were self-limited, without any grade 3-5 toxicity. Conclusion(s): CIRT is one of the most effective nonsurgical treatments for colorectal lung metastases, which are relatively resistant to stereotactic body radiotherapy. CIRT is considered to be the least invasive approach even in patients who have undergone repeated prior thoracic metastasectomies. © 2014 Takahashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2262,"Prospective comparison study of 532/1064 nm picosecond laser vs 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser in the treatment of professional tattoos in asians Background and Aims: Although, the pulse width should be shorter than the thermal relaxation time of the target, nanosecond laser pulses are not short enough for tattoo removal. Complications are common, such as hyper or hypopigmentation, textural changes, and scarring. Moreover, patients with darker skin types are at a higher risk of complications from tattoo removal using these lasers. Picosecond lasers were developed to overcome the limitation of nanosecond lasers. We did a comparison study of a 532/1064 nm picosecond laser vs a 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser to evaluate the clinical efficacy and complications of multi-color tattoos in Asians. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven Asian patients with 37 professional tattoos were enrolled in the study. Each patient was treated with a 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser and a 532/1064 nm picosecond laser. The spot size that was used with each laser was 3 mm. Four treatments were performed, with four week intervals between each treatment. Patients were examined a week after the first treatment and 3 months after the last treatment. Results and Conclusion(s): All patients tolerated the treatments well. The efficacy of the 1064 nm picosecond laser for black tattoos is significantly better than the other studied lasers. The efficacy of the 532 nm picosecond laser is significantly better than the other studied lasers for red tattoos. The efficacy of the 532 nm picosecond laser is significantly better than the 532 nm nanosecond laser and better than the 1064 nm picosecond laser for green tattoos. Mild to moderate post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation was observed in 35.1%, 24.3% 27.0%, and 21.6% of the tattoos treated with the 532 nm nanosecond laser, the 532 nm picosecond laser, the 1064 nm nanosecond laser, and the 1064 nm pico-second laser, respectively. Paradoxical darkening (5.4%) was observed equally with each type of laser. There was no scar formation in any of the tattoos treated. The 532/1064 nm picosecond laser is more effective than the 532/1064 nm nanosecond laser in the treatment of multi-color tattoos in Asians. The 532 nm picosecond laser is more effective than 1064 nm picosecond laser in every tattoo color, with the exception of black. Paradoxical darkening was observed, even the use of picosecond lasers.Copyright © 2020 JMLL, Tokyo, Japan.",Excluded
405,"Efficacy of sucralfate ointment in the prevention of acute proctitis in cancer patients: A randomized controlled clinical trial Background: Acute radiation proctitis (ARP) is a usual adverse effect in patients undergoing pelvic radiotherapy. The symptoms include diarrhea, rectal blood or mucus discharge, fecal urgency and tenesmus with pain. Sucralfate, an aluminum-based salt of sucrose octasulfate, is a cytoprotective agent that forms a coating barrier at injured sites by adhering to mucoproteins. It has been used in topical management of a wide variety of local lesion. This study was designed to evaluate the preventive effect of rectal sucralfate on acute radiotherapy induced proctitis. Method(s): Seven percent sucralfate ointment was prepared for topical use. Drug quantification, chemical stability and microbial limit tests were performed carefully. In this randomized double blind placebo controlled trial, fifty-seven patients with pelvic malignancies undergoing radiotherapy were allocated to receive either 1 g of sucralfate or 1 g of placebo, given as a twice daily ointment, one day before and during radiotherapy for six weeks. The eligible patients were evaluated based on RTOG acute toxicity criteria and the following ARP symptoms weekly: Rectal hemorrhage, diarrhea, rectal pain, and fecal urgency. The influence of symptoms on lifestyle was also recorded weekly. Result(s): Acute proctitis was significantly less prevalent in patients in the sucralfate group. The incidence of rectal bleeding (P=0.003), diarrhea (P=0.002), rectal pain (P=<0.001) and fecal urgency (P=0.002) was significantly less common in the sucralfate group. No statistical significant difference was observed for radiotherapy induced cystitis in the placebo and sucralfate groups (P=0.27). Conclusion(s): This study suggests that sucralfate7% ointment reduces the incidence of symptoms associated with acute radiation proctitis.Copyright © 2020, Babol University of Medical Sciences.",Excluded
348,"Analysis of biologically equivalent dose of stereotactic body radiotherapy for primary and metastatic lung tumors Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal biologically equivalent dose (BED) for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) by comparing local control rates in proportion to various total doses and fractionation schedules. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-four patients with early non-small-cell lung cancer and a single metastatic lung tumor were included in this study. Differences in local control rates were evaluated according to gender, primary tumor site, response, tumor size, and BED. For comparison of BEDs, the prescribed dose for SBRT was stratified according to three groups: high (BED > 146 Gy), medium to high (BED, 106 to 146 Gy), and low to medium (BED < 106 Gy). Result(s): For all patients, the overall local control rate was 85.3% at two years after treatment. Five local recurrences were observed, and, notably, all of them were observed in the low to medium BED group. Significantly higher local control rates were observed for patients with a complete response than for those with a partial response or stable disease (p < 0.001). Twenty-six patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm showed no dose-response relationship in the low to medium, medium to high, and high BED groups, whereas eight patients with a tumor size of = 3 cm showed a significant dose-response relationship. The observed 2-year local recurrence-free survival rates in patients with a tumor size of < 3 cm and in those with a tumor size of = 3 cm were 96.2% and 50.0%, respectively, which were significantly different (p=0.007). Conclusion(s): BED > 100 Gy is required in order to achieve a > 85% local control rate regardless of tumor size. The optimal dose for small tumors of < 3 cm appears to be within a range below 150 Gy BED. Escalation of BED to high levels (> 150 Gy) may be required for patients with a tumor size larger than 3 cm.Copyright © 2014 by the Korean Cancer Association.",Excluded
1380,"Survival in small cell lung cancer in India: Prognostic utility of clinical features, laboratory parameters and response to treatment BACKGROUND: Predictors of survival and response to treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are ill-defined and unclear. In an attempt to assess the impact of common presenting symptoms and laboratory values on survival, we undertook this retrospective review of patients with SCLC. To our knowledge, there is no study on survival in SCLC patients from the Indian subcontinent. DESIGN: Retrospective Cohort study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All newly diagnosed small cell lung cancer cases from December 2001 through December 2004, were identified and clinical data on presenting symptoms and laboratory findings from their hospital records, noted. The influence of various pretreatment factors on survival was investigated using Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox multivariate regression model. RESULT(S): 76 subjects were included (84% males, 91% smokers). 57% patients had five or more symptoms at presentation. Cumulative symptom burden was strongly associated with survival ( P =0.02). Survival was also significantly related with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ( P =0.04), disease extent (P =0.03) and symptomatic response to treatment ( P< 0.001). Patients with higher hemoglobin ( P =0.02), serum sodium ( P =0.04) and serum globulin ( P =0.02), survived significantly longer. By multivariate regression analysis, hemoglobin, KPS and brain metastases, were significant predictors of survival ( P =0.01, P =0.02, P< 0.01 respectively). CONCLUSION(S): Cumulative symptom burden, KPS, disease extent and symptomatic assessment of improvement after treatment, are useful predictors of survival. This has important clinical implications, keeping in view, the infrastructure and cost involved in more objective tests like CT scan, for evaluation of disease extent and prognosis. These findings can provide a simple basis for predicting prognosis in small cell lung cancer, especially in developing countries like ours.",Excluded
2622,"Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment and Solar Radiation in Northwestern Spain OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and solar radiation in northwestern Spain., METHODS: All RRD cases in Pontevedra from 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Climatological data from 4 weather stations in the area were collected. The association between RRD incidence and solar radiation was investigated., RESULTS: A total of 256 RRD cases were identified. There was a seasonal variation in the incidence of RRD with a maximum number of incident cases observed in June and July and a minimum number of cases observed in January and December. An association was found between RRD incidence and solar radiation both monthly (p = 0.004) and bimonthly (p = 0.057). The right eye was more frequently affected than the left eye (p = 0.035). RD cases other than rhegmatogenous showed neither seasonality nor association with radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Solar radiation may play a role in RRD genesis in our area. Laterality could be related to the amount of radiation reaching each eye. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
1131,"Diagnostic and prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score of zero: Is it time for guidelines to change? Introduction: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) use has progressively increased as the preferred initial test to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) when clinical likelihood is low. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) detected by CT is a well-established marker for cardiovascular risk. However, it is not recommended for diagnosis of obstructive CAD. Absence of CAC, defined as an Agatston score of zero, has been associated to good prognosis despite underestimation of non-calcified plaques. Purpose(s): To evaluate whether zero CAC score could help ruling out obstructive CAD in a safely manner. Method(s): Observational study based on a prospective database of patients (pts) referred to cardiac CT between 2017 and 2019. Pts with an Agatston score of zero were selected. Result(s): We included 176 pts with zero CAC score and non-invasive coronary angiography performed. The median duration of follow-up was 23.9 months. Baseline characteristics of the population are shown in Table 1. In 117 pts (66.5%), cardiac CT was indicated as part of their chest pain evaluation. Mean age was 57.2 years old, 68.2% were women and only and 9.4% were active smokers. Normal coronary arteries were found in 173 pts (98.3%). Obstructive CAD, defined as >=50% luminal diameter stenosis of a major vessel, was present in 1/176 (0.6%); while non-obstructive atherosclerotic plaques were found in 2 pts (1.1%). During follow-up, one patient died of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. None either suffered from myocardial infarction or needed coronary revascularization. Conclusion(s): In our cohort, a zero CAC score detected by cardiac CT rules out obstructive coronary artery disease in 98.3%, with only 1.7% of non-calcified atherosclerosis plaques and 0.6% of major adverse events. Although further research on this topic is needed, these results support the fact that non-invasive coronary angiography could be avoided in patients with low clinical likelihood of CAD and zero CAC score, facilitating the management of the increasing demand for coronary CT and reduction of radiation dose.",Excluded
411,"Parkinson's disease: a test of the multifactorial etiologic hypothesis We studied the relative etiologic importance upon the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) of occupational exposure to herbicides and other compounds, ionizing radiation exposure, family history of PD and essential tremor, smoking, and history of various viral and other medical conditions. We identified patients (n = 130) with neurologist-confirmed idiopathic PD through contacts with Calgary general hospitals, long-term care facilities, neurologists, the Movement Disorder Clinic, and the Parkinson's Society of Southern Alberta, and selected two matched (by sex and age +/- 2.5 years) community controls for each case by random digit dialing. We obtained lifetime work, chemical, radiation, medical, and smoking exposure histories and family histories of PD and essential tremor by personal interviews, and analyzed the data using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. After controlling for potential confounding and interaction between the exposure variables, using multivariate statistical methods, having a family history of PD was the strongest predictor of PD risk, followed by head trauma and then occupational herbicide use. Cases and controls did not differ in their previous exposures to smoking or ionizing radiation; family history of essential tremor; work-related contact with aluminum, carbon monoxide, cyanide, manganese, mercury, or mineral oils; or history of arteriosclerosis, chicken pox, encephalitis, hypertension, hypotension, measles, mumps, rubella, or Spanish flu. These results support the hypothesis of a multifactorial etiology for PD, probably involving genetic, environmental, trauma, and possibly other factors.",Excluded

831,"Computer-Assisted Distal Radius Osteotomy Purpose: To establish the accuracy, precision, and clinical feasibility of a novel technique of computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy for the correction of symptomatic distal radius malunion. Method(s): Six patients underwent a computer-assisted distal radius osteotomy and were followed-up for an average of 25 months. Objective radiographic measurements and functional outcomes, as measured by clinical examination including grip strength and range of motion, and Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaires, were used. Result(s): The mean radiographic parameters included an increase of radial inclination to 21degree from 12degree (normal, 23degree). Dorsal and volar tilt (malunion) were corrected to 9degree from -30degree and 21degree, respectively (normal, 10degree). Ulnar variance was corrected to 1.9 mm from 7.5 mm (normal, +1.5 mm). Normal is defined as the average of the contralateral limb radiographs. The mean clinical outcome measures at an average of 25 months included a DASH global score of 14, a DASH individual item average score of 1.6, and an average affected side grip strength of 79% when compared with the unaffected side. Conclusion(s): The results of the computer-assisted technique were comparable with published results of traditional non-computer-assisted opening wedge osteotomy techniques. This technique allows a surgeon to accurately and precisely recognize and correct 3-dimensional deformities of the distal radius including axial malalignment (supination). The technique has the added benefit of reducing radiation exposure to the patient and surgical team because fluoroscopy is not used during the procedure. Additional benefits of the computer-assisted technique include the ability to perform multiple surgical simulations to optimize the alignment plan, and it serves as an excellent teaching tool for less-experienced surgeons.

606,"Dosimetry and toxicity of Quadramet for bone marrow ablation in multiple myeloma and other haematological malignancies Standard treatment regimens for haematological malignancies include myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and subsequent rescue by stem cell transplantation. However, these treatment regimens have significant associated mortality and morbidity, and disease recurrence remains a problem. One alternative approach is the targeted delivery of radiotherapy to the marrow using a bone-seeking agent labelled with an appropriate radioisotope, with the aim of delivering a potentially ablative radiation dose to marrow while minimising non-haematological toxicity. Pharmacokinetics and radiation dosimetry for a commercial preparation of samarium-153 ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP; Quadramet) were evaluated in 43 tracer (average dose 740 MBq) studies of 42 patients with haematological malignancies. Measurements of 24-h retention were also available following infusion of 18-48 GBq in 15 patients. Quadramet cleared rapidly from the tissue, with a median biological half-life of 1.4 h. Activity taken up by the skeleton was firmly bound, with activity decreasing according to physical half-life at 24 h in 29 of the 43 cases. The percentage activity retained in the skeleton at 24 h with tracer doses was high (62%+/-13%), although this decreased to approximately 30% with therapy infusions. Because of this decrease in retention, the maximum feasible therapy activity for this formulation of Quadramet is 35 GBq. Median absorbed marrow radiation dose was 0.78 Gy/GBq in tracer studies: the decreased retention at high activities means that this corresponds to a median dose of 12 Gy for 35 GBq administered activity. It is possible to use 24-h retention as a rough guide to marrow dose in individual patients. In tracer studies, median bladder radiation dose was 0.22 Gy/GBq and radiation dose to the liver was very conservatively estimated at 0.2 Gy/GBq. After therapy infusions of up to 50 GBq in 37 patients, non-haematopoietic toxicity was not seen in any patient. In addition, myelosuppression was achieved without evidence of myelofibrosis. The residual dose rate to marrow fell to a level acceptable for stem cell re-infusion by 2 weeks after administration.",Excluded
657,"Limiting values for the RBE of fission neutrons at low doses for life shortening in mice We have analyzed recently published data on the effects of low doses of fission neutrons on the mean survival times of mice. The analysis for single-dose exposures was confined to doses of 20 rad or less, while for fractionated exposures only total doses of 80 rad or less were considered. We fitted the data to the frequently used power function model: life shortening = beta D lambda, where D is the radiation dose. We show that, at low doses per fraction, either (1) the effects are not additive or (2) the dose-effect curve for single exposures cannot show a greater negative curvature than about the 0.9 power of dose. Analysis of the data for gamma rays showed that an exponent of 1.0 gave an acceptable fit. Taken together, these findings indicate that the RBE for neutrons cannot change more rapidly with neutron dose than about RBEN approximately = k/D0.1N. This conflicts with the more widely accepted relationship, RBEN approximately = k/D0.5N. Because of the inherent implausibility of exponents less than 1.0 for the neutron dose-effect curves at low doses we conclude that at neutron doses of 20 rad or less the RBE for life shortening is constant and ranges from 13 to 22 depending on mouse strain and sex.",Included

This retrospective study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation of small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus. Material/Methods: Ninety-two patients who underwent percutaneous argon-helium cryoablation between February 2012 and December 2018 at the Fifth Medical Center of the Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital were included. Treatment efficacy was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging or triphasic computed tomography scan within 1 week after each cryoablation procedure. Local tumor progression, distant recurrence, and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Result(s): A total of 92 patients with small HCC located adjacent to major organs or viscus who underwent cryoablation were retrospectively reviewed. The number of patients with tumors adjacent to the gallbladder, portal or hepatic vein, diaphragm, stomach, heart, and intestine was 22, 1, 39, 6, 8, and 16, respectively. Cumulative local tumor progression rates at 1 and 2 years were 2.8% and 7.3%, respectively. Cumulative distant recurrence rates at 1, 2, and 3 years were 11.1%, 17.6%, and 20.7%, respectively.

2436,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent surgically treated acromegaly: comparison with fractionated radiotherapy OBJECT: The authors tested the assumption that gamma knife radiosurgery is more effective than fractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have undergone unsuccessful resective surgery. Untreated and uncured acromegaly causes illness and death. Acromegalic patients in whom growth hormone and, particularly, insulin-like growth factor I are not normalized must undergo further treatment., METHODS: After unsuccessful operations, 16 patients suffering from recurrent and uncured acromegaly underwent stereotactic radiosurgery (25 Gy to the tumor margin, 50 Gy maximum), the outcome of which was compared with the result obtained in 50 patients who received fractionated radiotherapy (40 Gy). The cumulative distribution functions of the two groups (Kaplan-Meier estimate) differed significantly (p < 0.0001 in the log-rank test of Mantel). The mean time to simultaneous normalization of both parameters was 1.4 years in the group treated with the gamma knife and 7.1 years in the group treated with fractionated radiotherapy., CONCLUSIONS: The authors suggest the use of stereotactic radiosurgery as the preferred treatment for recurrent acromegaly resulting from unsuccessfully resected tumors.",Excluded
1275,"Accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy combined with induction and concomitant chemotherapy for inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: Impact of total treatment time Tumour cell proliferation during conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (RT) can negatively influence the treatment outcome in patients with unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Accelerated and hyperfractionated RT may therefore have an advantage over conventional RT. Moreover, earlier studies have suggested improved survival with addition of cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CT). We present here the results of combined treatment with induction and concomitant CT and accelerated hyperfractionated RT in a retrospective series of patients with advanced NSCLC. Between August 1990 and August 1995, 90 consecutive patients, aged 42-77 years (median 63 years), with locally advanced unresectable or medically inoperable NSCLC and good performance status were referred for treatment: stage: I 23%, IIIa 37%, IIIb 40%. Patients histologies included: squamous cell carcinoma 52%, adenocarcinoma 34% and large cell carcinoma 13%. The treatment consisted of two courses of CT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 day 1- 3 i.v.), the second course given concomitantly with RT. The total RT dose was 61.2-64.6 Gy, with two daily fractions of 1.7 Gy. A one-week interval was introduced after 40.8 Gy to reduce acute toxicity, making the total treatment time 4.5 weeks. Concerning toxicity, 33 patients had febrile neutropenia, 10 patients suffered from grade III oesophagitis and 7 patients had grade III pneumonitis. There were two possible treatment-related deaths, one due to myocardial infarction and the other due to a pneumocystis carinii infection. The 1-, 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 72%, 46% and 34%, respectively; median survival was 21.3 months. Fifty-one patients had progressive disease: 21 failed locoregionally, 29 had distant metastases and 9 patients had a combination of these. Pretreatment weight loss was the only prognostic factor found, except for stage. However, the results for stage IIIb were no different from those for stage IIIa. We conclude that the survival results compare favourably with those of most other studies with a manageable toxicity.",Excluded
480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded

Result(s): Due to the coexistence of pathology in different parts of the pelvic floor - more often in women - diagnostic confirmation is necessary so that the appropriate treatments can be accomplished in one single surgical approach. Outlet obstruction syndrome (OOS) was present in 262 patients. In 239 (82.4%) patients, an anterior rectocele was confirmed. In 55 (23%) of these cases, an anterior retrocele was the only finding. In 207 patients, other abdomino-pelvic anatomical dislocations were found that had not been clinically suspected or detected during physical examination. Conclusion(s): DMRPF is a study that does not expose patients to ionizing radiation providing dynamic interactive anatomical and functional data at rest and during provocative manoeuvers. Multi-plane imaging provides a clear view of the organs in the pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles which is not always accurately detected on physical examination. Currently, DMRPF is the recommended study designed to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction as it can be used to confirm presumptive diagnoses and to quantify the impact of the dislocation of pelvic floor viscera, to define intestinal emptying dynamics, and to outline inadequate relaxation of the puborectalis during straining and simulated evacuation.",Excluded
2754,"[ERCP procedures as a source of radiation risk to a single gastroenterologist] BACKGROUND: One of the numerous sub-areas of interventional radiology is the use of X-rays in gastroenterology. X-ray fluoroscopy is applied in therapeutic procedures, including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that is frequently performed. The ERCP procedure is aimed at imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tracts., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this paper radiation risk to the gastrenterologist performing ERCP procedures was investigated. The procedures were performed by a single gastroenterologist in the ERCP Laboratory, University Clinical Hospital Military Memorial Medical Academy - Central Veterans' Hospital in Lodz, Poland. The study comprised 2 series of measurements, one taken during the procedures with continuous fluoroscopy mode, the other during procedures with fluoroscopy in pulsed mode at a frequency of 3 pulses/s. Exposure parameters, anatomical data of patient and dose equivalents for the eyes, skin of the hand and the effective dose for whole body of the gastroenterologist were recorded during each procedure., RESULTS: The collected data cover 70 ERCP procedures - 40 procedures were controlled by continuous fluoroscopy and 30 by pulsed fluoroscopy. The results reveal that pulsed fluoroscopy makes it possible to reduce doses received by the gastroeneterologist from 45% to 60% compared to continuous fluoroscopy., CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures can cause radiation risk to the gastroenterologist performing them. The use of continuous fluoroscopy can result in achieving an equivalent dose to eye lens nearly 20 mSv per year, i.e., the decreased annual limit recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).

513,"Options for the modified radiation weighting factor of neutrons The recent ICRP Report 92 has noted that the current radiation weighting factor, wR, depends on the energy of the incident neutrons in a manner that differs substantially from the dependence, which results from the current convention, QL. At all neutron energies, but most conspicuously below 1 MeV, the values of wR exceed those of the effective quality factor, qE. The discrepancy is largely due to the fact that--in the absence of computed values of the effective quality factor for neutrons--wR has been patterned after the values of the ambient quality factor, which accounts insufficiently for the low-linear energy transfer (LET) gamma ray component from neutron capture in the human body. There are different options to remove the discrepancy. Option 1 is to reduce wR substantially at all neutron energies to make it equal to qE for a standard condition, such as isotropic incidence of the neutrons. Since such a reduction may cause problems in those countries where the current wR values are already legally implemented, ICRP 92 has proposed what is here termed Option 2. It recommended to replace QL by the increased value 1.6 QL - 0.6 and, accordingly, to make the radiation weighting factor equal to 1.6 qE - 0.6. With Option 2 the radiation weighting factor needs to be decreased appreciably at low neutron energies, but for fission neutron spectra the overall changes are minor. To guide--regardless which option is chosen--the selection of the numerical values, the effective quality factor, qE, is computed here for different directional distributions of neutrons incident on the anthropomorphic phantoms ADAM and EVA. None of the sex averaged numerical values is found to deviate much from those for isotropic incidence. Isotropic incidence can, thus, be used as an adequate standard condition. A numerical approximation is proposed for the standard qE that is nearly equivalent to a formula invoked by ICRP 92, but is somewhat simpler and provides realistic values of qE even for the extremely high neutron energies in space. In line with ICRP 92, it is emphasised that wR needs to be seen as a derived quantity related to the LET-dependent weighting factor. Copyright 2004 Oxford University Press",Excluded
3421,"Risk of stomach cancer incidence in a cohort of Mayak PA workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation Stomach cancer is a widespread health condition associated with environmental and genetic factors. Contribution of ionizing radiation to stomach cancer etiology is not sufficiently studied. This study was aimed to assess an association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with doses from occupational radiation exposure in a cohort of workers hired at main Mayak production association facilities in 1948-1982 taking into account non-radiation factors including digestive disorders. The study cohort comprised 22,377 individuals and by 31.12.2013 343 stomach cancer diagnoses had been reported among the cohort members. Occupational stomach absorbed doses were provided by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2008 (MWDS-2008) for external gamma ray exposure and by the Mayak Worker Dosimetry System- 2013 (MWDS-2013) for internal exposure to plutonium. Excess relative risks (ERR) per Gy for stomach cancer were estimated using the Poisson's regression. Analyses were run using the AMFIT module of the EPICURE software. The stomach cancer incidence risk in the study cohort was found to be significantly associated with the stomach absorbed dose of gamma rays: ERR/Gy = 0.19 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.44) with a 0 year lag, and ERR/Gy = 0.20 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.45) with a 5 year lag. To estimate the baseline risk, sex, attained age, smoking status and alcohol consumption, chronic diseases (peptic ulcer, gastritis and duodenitis) were taken into account. No modifications of the radiogenic risk by non-radiation factors were found in the study worker cohort. No association of the stomach cancer incidence risk with internal exposure to incorporated plutonium was observed.Copyright: © 2020 Zhuntova et al.

693,"Reduction of patient radiation dose with a new organ based dose modulation technique for thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) (Liver dose right index) PURPOSE: To evaluate the radiation dose reduction, image quality and diagnostic confidence with thoraco-abdominopelvic computed tomography (TACT) using a new organ based dose modulation system (liver dose right index [Liver DRI]), compared to TACT using a standard automatic exposure control adjusting mA according to attenuation., METHODS: A total of 37 patients who had two TACT examinations on 2 different CT scanners, one using standard automatic exposure control (combination of a DoseRight automatic current selection and Z modulation) and one using Liver DRI were included. There were 19 men and 18 women with a mean age of 67.6+/-11.7 (SD) years (range: 36-85 years) For each patient, volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were evaluated at each anatomic level (lung, breast, liver and pelvis area) for each protocol. Two radiologists assessed independently image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence., RESULTS: The radiation dose decreased significantly using Liver DRI compared to standard automatic exposure control on the total scan length, lung, breast and pelvis area, with a significant CTDIvol reduction of 27% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002), 24% (P=0.0002) and 31% (P=0.0001), respectively; and a significant SSDE reduction of 23% (P=0.0001), 28% (P=0.0001), 23% (P=0.0002) and 29% (P=0.0001), respectively. No significant SNR reductions were observed in all measured tissues at the level of the aortic arch, celiac trunk and iliac bifurcation, except in the muscle (P=0.0013) and fat tissue (P=0.0052) at the level of the ureteral meatus. No significant differences were noted between both protocols in overall image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence with an excellent inter observer agreement between radiologists (Kappa values of 0.83, 0.85 and 0.88, respectively)., CONCLUSION: Liver DRI organ based dose modulation technique allows significant dose reduction compared to standard automatic exposure control while preserving diagnostic image quality in all thoraco-abdominopelvic areas.

1026,"Assessment of pulmonary 18F-FDG-PET uptake and cytokine profiles in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and erlotinib Purpose To investigate effects of radiotherapy (RT) and erlotinib on pulmonary glucose uptake using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during and after treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to identify associations between serum cytokine levels and lung glucose uptake. Material and methods Twenty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC, receiving RT alone or concomitant RT and erlotinib therapy, were examined by 18F-FDG PET before, during, and after treatment. A total of 57 18F-FDG PET scans were analyzed. Pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake and radiotherapy dose mapping were used to acquire dose-response curves for each patient, where subsequent linear regression gave a glucose uptake level in the un-irradiated parts of the lungs (SUV0) and a response slope (DELTASUV). Serum cytokine levels at corresponding time points were assessed using a multiplex bioassay. Correlations between the most robust cytokines and lung 18F-FDG dose response parameters were further investigated. Results From the dose response analysis, SUV0 at post-therapy was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than at mid- and pre-therapy (45% and 58%, respectively) for the group receiving RT + erlotinib. Also, SUV0 at post-therapy was higher for patients receiving RT + erlotinib compared to RT alone (42%; P < 0.001). No differences in DELTASUV were seen with treatments or time. SUV0 was positively associated (r = 0.47, P = 0.01) with serum levels of the chemokine C-C motif ligand 21 (CCL21) for patients receiving RT + erlotinib. Conclusions Concomitant RT and erlotinib causes an elevation in pulmonary 18F-FDG uptake post treatment compared to RT alone. Pulmonary glucose uptake is associated with an upregulation of a chemokine (CCL21) involved in inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2017 The Authors",Excluded
2916,"EGFR-amplification plus gene expression profiling predicts response to combined radiotherapy with EGFR-inhibition: A preclinical trial in 10 HNSCC-tumour-xenograft models Background and purpose Improvement of the results of radiotherapy by EGFR inhibitors is modest, suggesting significant intertumoural heterogeneity of response. To identify potential biomarkers, a preclinical trial was performed on ten different human squamous cell carcinoma xenografts of the head and neck (HNSCC) studying in vivo and ex vivo the effect of fractionated irradiation and EGFR inhibition. Local tumour control and tumour growth delay were correlated with potential biomarkers, e.g. EGFR gene amplification and radioresponse-associated gene expression profiles. Material and methods Local tumour control 120 days after end of irradiation was determined for fractionated radiotherapy alone (30 f, 6 weeks) or after simultaneous EGFR-inhibition with cetuximab. The EGFR gene amplification status was determined using FISH. Gene expression analyses were performed using an in-house gene panel. Results Six out of 10 investigated tumour models showed a significant increase in local tumour control for the combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy compared to irradiation alone. For 3 of the 6 responding tumour models, an amplification of the EGFR gene could be demonstrated. Gene expression profiling of untreated tumours revealed significant differences between amplified and non-amplified tumours as well as between responder and non-responder tumours to combined radiotherapy and cetuximab. Conclusion The EGFR amplification status, in combination with gene expression profiling, may serve as a predictive biomarker for personalized interventional strategies regarding combined treatment of cetuximab and fractionated radiotherapy and should, as a next step, be clinically validated.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
600,"Selective arterial embolisation for the treatment of mobile spine aneurismal bone cyst: Prospective study Introduzione: Aneurismal Bone Cyst (ABC) is a benign cystic lesion of the bone made of blood containing gaps separated by connective tissue. In 10-30 % of cases ABC is localized at spine level. Different treatment options are possible: 1) curettage and bone grafting; 2) en bloc excision; 3) selective arterial embolization (SAE); 4) radiotherapy; 5) combination of these procedures. The aim of this study is to evaluate prospectively the results obtained using SAE only for the treatment of ABC. Materiali e metodi: 20 patients (9 female, 11 male), mean age 24 years (range: 12-39 years), mean follow up 40 months (range: 9.4- 49.4 months) affected by Aneurismal Bone Cyst of the mobile spine without instability were analyzed. Patients underwent the same diagnostic protocol (X-ray, CT scan, MRI) and the same treatment (selective arterial embolization). The same evaluation protocol was used for all patients (X-ray, CT scan at 8 weeks following embolization). Risultati: From one to seven SAE were performed depending on cases. The mean length of hospital stay was 2.2 days for each embolization treatment (range 2-5 days). 18 patients on 20 were treated using SAE only. In 1 case, presenting progressive paraplegia due to T8 ABC, surgical decompression and T6-T10 fixation were needed. (Frankel E after surgery). After 3 months F.U. local recurrence was observed and it is being treated using SAE. In 1 case, presenting C7 ABC, an Halo Vest was necessary for 30 days, being substituted by a Minerva plaster for three months. 19 patient on 20 are classified as NED (no evidence of disease) at the last F.U. 1 patient as AWD (alive with disease). Discussione e conclusioni: ABC is a benign lesion but in some cases can be locally aggressive causing pain, loss of function, spinal cord, nerve roots or cauda equina compression and pathological fractures. Selective arterial embolization (SAE) was used first as adjuvant procedure to reduce bleeding during surgery. First, De Rosa in 1990 treated ABC using embolization only. Nowadays SAE represents an effective, safe and minimally invasive approach for the treatment of ABC. It could be considered the gold standard treatment for ABC without instability or neurological complications. In the case of failure or poor results surgical treatment must be considered.",Excluded
1447,Role of the direct action of radiation in the mechanism of development of mammary gland tumors The role of the direct action of radiation in the genesis of mammary gland tumors in animals of both sexes was studied in experiments on noninbred albino rats. In two series of experiments the anterior or posterior half of the rat's body was irradiated with X rays in doses of 200 to 1000 rad. Tumors of the mammary glands appeared considerably earlier and were more numerous in the irradiated parts of the body of both females and males than in the unirradiated glands or in control animals. Females developed mammary gland tumors after exposure to smaller doses and in a higher proportion of cases than males.,Included

1686,"High thyroid radiation dose associated with 131-I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning We have examined two patients undergoing 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scans in order to assess thyroidal radiation dose. Thyroid uptakes of 3--5% of the administered 2 mCi dose were found despite prior administration of Lugol's iodine. Analysis of serum samples over a ten day period after iodocholesterol injection indicated that less than 10% of the radioactivity was free iodide. Kinetic results showed a high value for the thyroid/plasma 131I ratio indicating thyroid retention of 131I. This was substantiated by thyroid scintigrams. The thyroid radiation dose was estimated to be 200--250 rad for the two patients. The associated carcinogenic risk is of sufficient magnitude, in our opinion, to warrant regular follow-up of all patients who have undergone 131I-19-iodocholesterol adrenal scanning.",Excluded
309,"Treatment outcomes of T4 locally advanced head and neck cancers with soft tissue invasion or bone and cartilage invasion PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S):: T4 locally advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHN) with bone and cartilage invasion (BCI) traditionally have been treated with resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Because the organ preservation trials, more patients with BCI, as well as those with soft tissue invasion (STI), have been treated with definitive CRT. This is a review of our experience. MATERIALS/METHODS:: We performed a retrospective review of patients who underwent definitive CRT or radical resection followed up with postoperative CRT for T4N0-3M0 locally advanced SCCHN. We analyzed outcomes based on STI/BCI and types of treatment. Radiotherapy doses ranged from 59.4 to 72 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy was platinum based in all CRT patients. RESULT(S):: From 1995 to 2006, 101 patients with locally advanced SCCHN were treated definitively. Of these, 51 had STI and 50 had BCI. Of the 51 patients with STI, 42 were treated with CRT, 5 patients were treated with resection followed by CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Of the 50 patients with BCI, 26 patients were treated with CRT, 20 patients were treated with radical resection followed by radiotherapy or CRT, and 4 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Five-year local-regional control was 51% and 43% for STI and BCI patients treated with CRT, respectively, and 44% for BCI treated with radical resection. Five-year overall survival was 23%, 51%, and 28% for STI treated with CRT, BCI treated with CRT, and BCI treated with radical resection. Outcomes were not statistically different between these groups. CONCLUSION(S):: This study suggests similar outcomes for CRT or resection followed up with chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced SCCHN with BCI. Concurrent CRT may be viable alternative to upfront resection in these patients. Further studies should be performed to validate these provocative findings.

1156,"Nucleoid sedimentation analysis of DNA superstructure, gamma-radiation-induced damage and repair in human and chacma baboon (Papia ursinus) peripheral lymphocytes The use of the chacma baboon (Papio ursinus) in radiobiological investigations justifies special attention because it answers many of the criteria of parallelism to the human. The present study was undertaken to establish whether in vitro gamma-radiation effects in chacma baboon and human lymphocytes are comparable. The sensitive and rapid nucleoid sedimentation technique was employed to evaluate in vitro DNA superstructure, damage and repair in readily obtainable radiosensitive peripheral lymphocytes. Dose-response curves after 60Co gamma-irradiation were obtained, and by applying single-hit kinetics of the target theory, an estimation of molecular masses of the supercoiled domains was made. The baboon and human lymphocytes produced analogous results, while an ethidium bromide intercalation study also revealed a similarity in average DNA superhelical density. Lymphocyte DNA repair after 0.5-4.0 Gy gamma-irradiation and repair times from 0.5 to 5.0 h were evaluated. The repair data obtained from baboon and human cells after 2.0 Gy irradiation compared favourably in extent of DNA repair as well as the profiles of the kinetic curves. These findings indicate that the chacma baboon would be a useful and relevant model for further in vivo radiobiological studies on lymphocytes. The effects of sedimentation conditions and advantages of using vertical-tube rotors in the nucleoid sedimentation technique are also discussed.",Included
1851,"Results of hypofractionated whole brain radiotherapy (2x8 Gy) for patients with brain metastases from lung cancer Purpose: To evaluate the clinical and radiologic response rates, toxicity and tolerability of 2x8 Gy whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases (BM). Method(s): WBRT was delivered to 126 lung cancer patients with BM during 2002-2006. External beam RT was delivered with a fraction dose of 8 Gy on the same day of each consecutive week. Tumor and symptom response and toxicity were recorded at every follow-up. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) and the new Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) were used for analysis of overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-three patients had small cell (SCLC) and 103 had non small cell lung cancer. Pretreatment median Karnofsky performance score (KPS) was 70 (range 20-90). Clinical response rates were as follows: complete 31%; good partial 30.2%; partial 21.4%; stable 7.9%; and progressive 5.6%. Median palliation and survival duration was 57 and 80 days, respectively. Two- and 6-month survival rates (SR) were 59.5% and 25.4%, respectively. According to recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) 6-month SR for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 61.5, 41.6 and 33.9%, respectively (p=0.002).

However, the late morbidity of this schedule is unknown so its use could be restricted to patients with poor performance status, with a short life expectancy and/or social problems, unlikely to tolerate more protracted radiotherapy regimens. © 2011 Zerbinis Medical Publications.",Excluded
1845,"Contamination of banked femoral head allograft: Incidence, bacteriology and donor follow up Background: Allograft donations are not uncommonly found to be contaminated. The issue of contaminated donations from live donors at the time of surgery, and the significance of this to the patient in terms of subsequent sepsis of the arthroplasty, were examined. Method(s): The donations of femoral heads to the Queensland Bone Bank over a 9-year period were reviewed, and the incidence and bacteriology of contamination were detailed. Clinical outcomes were determined for donors who had positive cultures at the time of retrieval and they were compared with those of culture-negative donors. Result(s): Between March 1987 and February 1996, 232 femoral heads were donated to the Queensland Bone Bank. Four specimens were sent for culture with each femoral head (surface swab of femoral head, acetabular swab, bone biopsy and capsule). In 51 cases, one or more positive cultures were obtained (22% contamination rate). The majority of organisms cultured were Staphylococcus epidermidis. One hundred and seventy donations came from surgery performed at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, and 40 femoral heads were considered contaminated. Deep infection was recorded in one of the 40 cases with contaminated donations and three out of 130 non-contaminated donations had subsequent septic episodes. Conclusion(s): The contamination rate detailed in the present report is higher than in most series. This may be due to the fact that four bacteriological specimens are taken to assess contamination. Two of these specimens are tissue samples which yielded more positive results than did the two swabs. All other series take no more than two bacteriological specimens, which are usually bone swabs. These are shown to have a poor yield of positive cultures. Therefore there is a significant underestimation of contamination rates by other bone banks. This has implications for the recipients of bone from those banks, particularly when the allograft material is not secondarily sterilized. This is important given increasing allograft usage, and the increasing numbers of revision joint arthroplasty and impaction grafting procedures being performed. Sterilization of all bone by irradiation to 25 kGy is recommended.",Excluded
243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded

Retrospective study of 135 cases OBJECTIVE: To report the profile of histologic cervical nodes involvement associated with mobile tongue squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study concerned patients treated from 1978 to 1998 by cervical neck dissection for mobile tongue carcinoma. RESULT(S): A population of 135 patients (90 M/45 F, sex-ratio 2) with a 53.5 mean age (19 to 75) is analyzed. Clinical palpable nodes were present in 68 cases (50%) mainly submental-submaxillar (54). Histologic examination showed a node involvement in 54 cases without (32 cases) or with capsular rupture (22 cases) mainly in the jugulo-carotidian chain (46/54). Among the 67 clinically N0 patients collected after 1990, 22 patients (33%) exhibited an histological involvement vs 32/68 (47%) for the group presenting palpable cervical nodes for the whole period. Histologic node involvement seemed to be linked to the clinical status, node size and TNM stage. CONCLUSION(S): Cervical lymph node treatment needs to be systematic in mobile tongue carcinoma. The probability of histologic involvement is linked to the loco-regional extent of disease and influences the prognosis. In N0 patients, neck dissection is required because of the frequency of histological involvement, particularly when loss to follow-up may be expected.",Excluded

Most experimental animal studies for assessing the biological effects of charged particles have involved acute dose delivery for single ions and/or fractionated exposure protocols. Here, we assessed the behavioral and cognitive performance of female and male C57BL/6J x DBA2/J F1 (B6D2F1) mice 2 months following rapidly delivered, sequential irradiation with protons (1 GeV, 60%), 16O (250 MeV/n, 20%), and 28Si (263 MeV/n, 20%) at 0, 25, 50, or 200 cGy at 4-6 months of age. Cortical BDNF, CD68, and MAP-2 levels were analyzed 3 months after irradiation or sham irradiation. During the dark period, male mice irradiated with 50 cGy showed higher activity levels in the home cage than sham-irradiated mice. Mice irradiated with 50 cGy also showed increased depressive behavior in the forced swim test. When cognitive performance was assessed, sham-irradiated mice of both sexes and mice irradiated with 25 cGy showed normal responses to object recognition and novel object exploration. However, object recognition was impaired in female and male mice irradiated with 50 or 200 cGy. For cortical levels of the neurotrophic factor BDNF and the marker of microglial activation CD68, there were sex x radiation interactions. In females, but not males, there were increased CD68 levels following irradiation. In males, but not females, there were reduced BDNF levels following irradiation. A significant positive correlation between BDNF and CD68 levels was observed, suggesting a role for activated microglia in the alterations in BDNF levels. Finally, sequential beam irradiation impacted the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. These included dose-dependent impacts and alterations to the relative abundance of several gut genera, such as Butyricicoccus and Lachnospiraceae. Thus, exposure to rapidly delivered sequential proton, 16O ion, and 28Si ion irradiation significantly affects behavioral and cognitive performance, cortical levels of CD68 and BDNF in a sex-dependent fashion, and the gut microbiome.",Included
3297,"Prevalence of incidental or unexpected findings on low-dose CT performed during routine SPECT/CT nuclear medicine studies INTRODUCTION: In nuclear medicine, single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) is often combined with 'simultaneous' low-dose CT (LDCT) to provide complementary anatomical and functional correlation. As a consequence, numerous incidental and unexpected findings may be detected on LDCT. Recognition of these findings and appropriate determination of their relevance can add to the utility of SPECT/CT. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and categorise the relevance of incidental and unexpected findings on LDCT scans performed as part of routine SPECT/CT studies., METHODS: All available LDCT scans performed as part of SPECT/CT studies at St. Vincent's Hospital Melbourne in the year 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Two qualified radiologists independently reviewed the studies and any previous available imaging and categorised any detected incidental findings., RESULTS: A total of 2447 LDCT studies were reviewed. The relevance of the findings was classified according to a modified version of a scale used in the Colonography Reporting and Data System: E1 = normal or normal variant (28.0%); E2 = clinically unimportant (63.5%); E3 = likely unimportant or incompletely characterised (6.2%); E4 = potentially important (2.5%)., CONCLUSION: Imaging specialists need to be cognisant of incidental and unexpected findings present on LDCT studies performed as part of SPECT/CT. Appropriate categorisation of findings and communication of potentially important findings to referring clinicians should form part of routine practice. The overall prevalence of potentially significant incidental and unexpected findings in our series was 8.7% (E3, 6.2%; E4, 2.5%) and was comparable to rates in other published imaging series.

2627,"Chromosomal aberrations in C-arm fluoroscopy, CT-scan, lithotripsy, and digital radiology staff We have assessed chromosome-type aberrations and micronuclei in the peripheral lymphocytes of personnel working with C-arm fluoroscopy, multi-slice CT-scan, lithotripsy, and digital radiology medical procedures. The study population comprised of 46 exposed workers and 35 controls matched for age, gender, and other confounding factors. Chromosome-type aberrations and micronuclei were analyzed and compared with occupational dosimetry data. The highest frequency of both chromosome aberrations (1.62 CA/100 cells) and MN (MN = 7.47 +/- 2.55) was observed in the operating room group. According to occupational dosimetry, surgeons and medical staff received 0-2.99 mSv over the previous year, well below the limit established by the International Committee on Radiation Protection. An increased level of chromosomal aberrations was observed among workers exposed in the operating rooms. We recommend that operating room radiation safety programs be improved and better supervised, in particular for orthopedic surgeons and personnel performing fluoroscopically guided procedures.

72,"Effect of oral administration of Hypericum perforatum extract (St. John's wort) on skin erythema and pigmentation induced by UVB, UVA, visible light and solar simulated radiation Hypericin from St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) is a photosensitizing agent that may cause a severe photodermatitis when higher amounts of St John's wort are ingested by animals. Although Hypericum extracts are widely used in the treatment of depressive disorders, only a little information on the photosensitizing capacity of St John's wort in humans is available. In the present prospective randomized study we investigated the effect of the Hypericum extract LI 160 on skin sensitivity to ultraviolet B (UVB), ultraviolet A (UVA), visible light (VIS) and solar simulated radiation (SIM). Seventy two volunteers of skin types II and III were included and were divided into six groups, each consisting of 12 volunteers. In the single-dose study the volunteers (n = 48) received 6 or 12 coated tablets (5400 or 10800 mug hypericin). In the steady-state study the volunteers (n = 24) received an initial dose of 6 tablets (5400 mug hypericin), and subsequently 3 x 1 tablets (2700 mug hypericin) per day for 7 days. Phototesting was performed on the volar forearms prior to medication and 6 h after the last administration of Hypericum extract. The erythema-index and melanin-index were evaluated photometrically using a mexameter. After both single-dose and steady-state administration, no significant influence on the erythema-index or melanin-index could be detected, with the exception of a marginal influence on UVB induced pigmentation (p = 0.0471) in the single-dose study. The results do not provide evidence for a phototoxic potential of the Hypericum extract LI 160 in humans when administered orally in typical clinical doses up to 1800 mg daily. This is in accordance with previous pharmacokinetics studies that found hypericin serum and skin levels after oral ingestion of Hypericum extract always to be lower than the assumed phototoxic hypericin threshold level of 1000 ng/mL.

2940,"Plan quality and delivery time comparisons between volumetric modulated arc therapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy for scalp angiosarcoma: A planning study using X-ray voxel Monte Carlo algorithm Purpose/Objective(s): Radiation therapy (RT) dose calculations for treating scalp angiosarcoma must consider heterogeneous regions with multilayered complex densities of the bolus, scalp, skull, cerebral fluid, and brain. As a model-based algorithm does not accurately consider these various densities, it may not provide a sufficiently precise dose calculation for scalp angiosarcoma, resulting in the need for a more accurate dose calculation algorithm. We evaluated the advantages of volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) over intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in terms of plan quality, delivery time, and monitor unit (MU) using the x-ray Voxel Monte Carlo (XVMC) algorithm. Materials/Methods: Four patients were selected for this planning study. Clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as gross tumor volume (GTV) and the scalp, plus a margin of 30 mm added to the GTV along the scalp surface. Planning target volume (PTV) was determined by adding a 2-mm isotropic margin to the CTV. The median PTV was 465.9 cm3 (range 215.0-932.8 cm3). Three different coplanar treatment plans were created for each case, comprising a 2-arc VMAT plan as well as 5-field and 9-field step and shoot IMRT plans using a photon energy of 6 MV. Dose calculation was performed using the XVMC algorithm. Total RT dose of 60 Gy was prescribed to the PTV in 30 fractions. The homogeneity index (HI) of the PTV, conformity index (CI) of the PTV, organ at risk (OAR) doses, delivery time, and MU were calculated and compared. Result(s): VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans showed the following features, respectively: median values of HI, 0.14, 0.17, and 0.15; CIs100%, 0.64, 0.61, and 0.64; CIs98%, 0.72, 0.67, and 0.72; and CIs95%, 0.75, 0.68, and 0.72. All plans satisfied the dose constraints of OARs, except for the left lens in 2 cases with the 5-field IMRT plan. The median delivery time for VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans were 192, 659, and 885 s, respectively. Delivery time for VMAT was significantly shorter than that for the other 2 plans (P<0.01). The median MUs of the VMAT, 5-field, and 9-field IMRT plans were 1093, 747, and 912, respectively, with no significant differences. Conclusion(s): The VMAT provided plan quality comparable to 9-field IMRT and was superior to 5-field IMRT in terms of doses to both the PTV and OARs. Additionally, VMAT provided a shorter delivery time than IMRT without a significant increase in MU. Therefore, we recommend VMAT as a sophisticated irradiation technique for the treatment of scalp angiosarcoma.",Excluded
1165,"Radiation-induced malignancies after intensity-modulated versus conventional mediastinal radiotherapy in a small animal model A long-standing hypothesis in radiotherapy is that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) increases the risk of second cancer due to low-dose exposure of large volumes of normal tissue. Therefore, young patients are still treated with conventional techniques rather than with modern IMRT. We challenged this hypothesis in first-of-its-kind experiments using an animal model. Cancer-prone Tp53+/C273X knockout rats received mediastinal irradiation with 3x5 or 3x8Gy using volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT, an advanced IMRT) or conventional anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) beams using non-irradiated rats as controls (n=15/group, ntotal=90). Tumors were assigned to volumes receiving 90-107%, 50-90%, 5-50%, and <5% of the target dose and characterized by histology and loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). Irradiated rats predominantly developed lymphomas and sarcomas in areas receiving 50-107% (n=26) rather than 5-50% (n=7) of the target dose. Latency was significantly shortened only after 3x8Gy vs. controls (p<0.0001). The frequency (14/28 vs. 19/29; p=0.29) and latency (218 vs. 189 days; p=0.17) of radiation-associated tumors were similar after VMAT vs. AP/PA. LOH was strongly associated with sarcoma but not with treatment. The results do not support the hypothesis that IMRT increases the risk of second cancer. Thus the current practice of withholding dose-sparing IMRT from young patients may need to be re-evaluated.",Included
1161,"Liver cancers in Mayak workers Liver cancer mortality risks were evaluated in 11,000 workers who started working at the 'Mayak' Production Association in 1948-1958 and who were exposed to both internally deposited plutonium and external gamma radiation. Comparisons with Russian liver cancer incidence rates indicate excess risk, especially among those with detectable plutonium body burdens and among female workers in the plutonium plant. Comparisons within the Mayak worker cohort which evaluate the role of plutonium body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose indicate excess risk among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq (relative risk = 17; 95% CI = 8.0-36) and among workers in the plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based on urine measurements (relative risk = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.2). In addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P < 0.001). Relative risks tended to be higher for females than for males, probably because of the lower baseline risk and the higher levels of plutonium measured in females. Because of limitations in current plutonium dosimetry, no attempt was made to quantify liver cancer risks from plutonium in terms of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably evaluated.

3303,"Change of cathepsin K activity in human skin in vivo after chronic ultraviolet damage Objective: Photoaging is histologically characterized by the accumulation of abnormal elastin-containing material and disorganization of decreased bundles of collagen fibers. The fundamental mechanisms are still poorly understood. So far, most of the photoaging studies are focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It was described that cathepsin K (catK) might play an important role in mediating intracellular elastin degradation.We hypothesize that catK may be related to ECM homeostasis in photoaging. We therefore studied the activity of catK in human skin in response to chronic SSR. Method(s): Eight healthy Chinese volunteers (4 males and 4 females) were enrolled in the study after signing an informed consent that was approved by the medical ethics committee in our hospital ([2009]2-2). They were 21 to 26 years old with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III or IV. The untanned upper buttock region was used as the site for exposure. The random side of upper buttock region was exposed to 1 MED of SSR (spectrum of 290-400 nm, 30% UVA + 70% UVB) per exposure every day for 5 successive days/week for 6 weeks. The other side of the upper buttock received no irradiation as control.The specific cathepsin K substrate, z-Leu-Arg-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin, was used. The fluorescence which the cleavage product emitted was recorded at 360 nm. The activity of catK was determined by the intensity of the fluorescence. All measurements were done in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined by using the paired samples t test. Calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0. Statistical significance was set at P<.05. Result(s): Chronic SSR exposure for 6 weeks induced a significant clinical and histologic change of chronic photodamage. The result showed that the average activity of the SSR-induced group was (8.09 +/- 5.22) 3 10-3 (nmol/mg * min) while that of the control group was (117.54 +/-39.01) x10-3 (nmol/mg * min). These data suggest that catK activity of the SSR-induced skin was obviously decreased compared to the normal control skin (P<.001). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that catK is related to photoaging, probably the process of solar elastosis.We propose that the decrease of catK activity might lead to a decline of elastin degradation and subsequent accumulation of elastin in the extracellular space.",Excluded
2619,"Personal UV exposure for different outdoor sports Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major environmental risk factor in the development of skin cancers and it occurs mainly during outdoor activities. The purpose of this study is to quantify the UV exposure suffered by amateur athletes (tennis players, hikers and runners) in their training schedules. The study on tennis player exposure took place at a tennis club in Valencia during the month of June 2011. With respect to the hiking group, the hikes studied took place in several mountainous areas of Spain and France from June to August 2011. Finally, the exposure suffered by ten runners while participating in a running circuit in the province of Valencia, from March to November 2011, was studied. The athletes were monitored using personal dosimeters (VioSpor), with the tennis players and runners wearing them on the wrist and the hikers on the shoulder. The median daily personal UV exposure for the hikers was 8.1 Standard Erythema Dose (SED) and for the tennis players 7.5 SED per day of training. The runners received a median of 14.6 SED while participating in the running circuit and about 2 SED per competition day. Median daily UV exposure of the hikers and tennis players exceeded 5 SED, which means that, in the case of non-sun-adapted skin type III and the non-use of sun protection, erythema may be induced in these subjects. However, the exposure suffered by the runners did not exceed the maximum personal exposure of 5 SED. Accordingly, it is necessary to encourage the use of high protection sunscreens and protective clothing and to avoid UV exposure in the hottest part of the day.",Excluded
1842,"Toxoplasma gondii: effect of sublethal irradiation on host resistance in mice The effect of sublethal whole-body irradiation (500 rad) on the resistance of C57BL/6 mice to infection with Toxoplasma gondii was studied. Mice irradiated 1 day before or 4 days after infection via the intraperitoneal or peroral route with cysts of the mildly virulent ME49 strain of T. gondii died sooner than did unirradiated controls. The time to death of irradiated mice was suggestive of impaired acquired immunity. Irradiated mice infected intraperitoneally with T. gondii cysts exhibited reduced levels of Thy-1+CD4-CD8- cells, less natural killer cell activity against YAC-1 targets, and lower levels of IFN-gamma than controls. Numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were also lower in infected, irradiated mice. Irradiated mice immunized with a vaccine strain of T. gondii, and later challenged with a highly virulent strain, were less well protected than unirradiated controls. Irradiation appears to impair early, CD4(+)- and CD(8+)-independent resistance to T. gondii, as well as acquisition of immunity.",Excluded
2907,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included
1232,"Validation of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay for use as a triage biological dosimetry tool Traditionally, the dicentric chromosome assay (DCA) has been used to derive biological dose estimates for unknown radiological exposures. While sensitive, this assay requires highly trained evaluators and is extremely time consuming. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been suggested as an alternative to the DCA, as it is much faster to evaluate samples and requires less technical expertise. In order to validate this assay for triage biodosimetry, dose-response curves were generated for six donors at eight doses of gamma-radiation (0-4.0 Gy). Each sample was evaluated by 12 individuals, among three different laboratories and the incidence of micronuclei was determined after counting 50-500 binucleated cells. This study demonstrated that the CBMN assay was capable of detecting radiation doses >or=1 Gy after scoring only 200 binucleated cells. As such, the CBMN assay may provide a sensitive and reliable technique for deployment as an initial screening tool in a large-scale radiological emergency where large numbers of biological dose estimates are required.",Included
2349,"ATM and p53 combined analysis predicts survival in glioblastoma multiforme patients: A clinicopathologic study Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant cancers, with a distinguishing dismal prognosis: surgery followed by chemo- and radiotherapy represents the current standard of care, and chemo- and radioresistance underlie disease recurrence and short overall survival of patients suffering from this malignancy. ATM is a kinase activated by autophosphorylation upon DNA doublestrand breaks arising from errors during replication, byproducts of metabolism, chemotherapy or ionizing radiations; TP53 is one of the most popular tumor suppressor, with a preeminent role in DNA damage response and repair. To study the effects of the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM and p53 in glioblastoma patients, 21 cases were retrospectively examined. In normal brain tissue, p-ATM was expressed only in neurons; conversely, in tumors cells, the protein showed a variable cytoplasmic expression (score: +,++,+++), with being completely undetectable in three cases. Statistical analysis revealed that high p-ATM score (++/+++) strongly correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.022). No difference in overall survival was registered between p53 normally expressed (NE) and overexpressed (OE) glioblastoma patients (P = 0.669). Survival analysis performed on the results from combined assessment of the two proteins showed that patients with NE p53 /low pATM score had longer overall survival than the NE p53/ high pATM score counterpart. Cox-regression analysis confirmed this finding (HR = 0.025; CI 95% = 0.002-0.284; P = 0.003). Our study outlined the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM/p53 in glioblastomas and provided data on their possible prognostic/predictive of response role. A ""non-oncogene addiction"" to ATM for NEp53 glioblastoma could be postulated, strengthening the rationale for development of ATM inhibiting drugs.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

Diagnostic scans were performed with 111 MBq of (123)I-MIBG. Therapeutic doses of (131)I-MIBG (5.55-7.40 GBq) were administrated and whole-body scans were obtained at 2-5 days after (131)I-MIBG administrations. We compared the number of lesions and the lesion-to-referent count ratios at 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and at 2-5 days of (131)I-MIBG., RESULTS: In comparison with the 6-h images of (123)I-MIBG, the 24-h images of (123)I-MIBG could detect more lesions in eight patients. Posttreatment (131)I-MIBG scans revealed new lesions in eight patients compared with the 24-h images of (123)I-MIBG. The lesion-to-referent count ratios at 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and at 3 days of (131)I-MIBG were increasing at later scanning time. There were significant differences in the lesion-to-referent count ratios between 6 and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG (P = 0.031), 6 h of (123)I-MIBG and 3 days of (131)I-MIBG (P = 0.020), and 24 h of (123)I-MIBG and 3 days of (131)I-MIBG (P = 0.018)., CONCLUSION: Low-dose diagnostic (123)I-MIBG whole-body scan is inferior to posttreatment (131)I-MIBG whole-body scan in malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma.

1956,"Quantitative changes in respiratory enzyme activity in premalignant lesions and experimentally irradiated skin Chronic exposure of human skin to solar irradiation results in a variety of preneoplastic and frankly neoplastic skin lesions.

Furthermore, there is enhancement of the usual concentration of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity in the granular zone as well as an increase in total G6PDH epidermal activity. In the experimental part of this study, six normal volunteer subjects had areas of normally non exposed skin (buttocks) irradiated with a 2 Mean erythema dose of ultra violet light (290--400 nm) on between 3 and 5 occasions per week for 2--6 week periods.

Purpose: To evaluate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) in patients after oncoplastic surgery for early breast cancer. Methods and Materials: A retrospective analysis of 136 breasts of 134 patients, who received breast-conserving oncoplastic surgery for low-risk breast cancer between 2002 and 2010 in the Universities of Vienna and Luebeck followed by adjuvant APBI applying total doses of pulse dose rate of 50.4Gy or high-dose rate (HDR) of 32Gy over 4days. Target volume definition was performed by the use of surgical-free margin data, related to intraoperatively fixed clip positions, pre- and postoperative imaging, and palpation. Result(s): At the time of data acquisition, 131 of 134 patients were alive. The median follow-up time was 39months (range, 4-106 months). After high-dose rate treatment, 3 of 89 patients showed systemic progress after a mean follow-up of 47months (range, 19-75 months) and 2 patients had a different quadrant in-breast tumor after 27 and 35months. One patient died 7months after treatment of unknown causes.

Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we assessed the outcome and safety of a novel quantificational and targeted foraminoplasty device named ZESSYS for LDH. Method(s): From September to December of 2016, 70 patients with symptomatic LDH were enrolled in the study. The patients were assigned randomly to either the ZESSYS group or the conventional TESSYS group. We recorded the cannula introduction time, decompression time, radiation exposure time, intraoperative pain feeling score, visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and Macnab criteria score of the 2 groups. The mean follow-up period was 14 months. Result(s): The average cannula introduction time (16.50 +/- 3.29 minutes) and the radiation exposure time (40.71 +/- 6.23 seconds) in the ZESSYS group were significantly reduced compared with the TESSYS group (cannula introduction time, 20.06 +/- 3.37 minutes, P = 0.000; radiation exposure time, 49.20 +/- 7.84 seconds, P = 0.000).

Conclusion(s): The novel targeted foraminoplasty technique with the specially designed double-cannulas is an effective and safe treatment for lumbar intervertebral disc herniation. It reduces the difficulty of PELD learning, minimizes radiation exposure, and decreases intraoperative pain associated with foraminoplasty.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1295,"Comparative stochastic effects of inhaled alpha- and beta-particle- emitting radionuclides in beagle dogs The stochastic effects of inhaled, insoluble particles of alpha- or beta- particle-emitting radionuclides were compared in dogs. Male and female beagle dogs were exposed briefly by nasal inhalation to relatively insoluble aerosols of 239PuO2 or 144Ce in fused aluminosilicate particles (FAP) and observed for cancer for their lifetimes. The initial lung burden and retention of each radionuclide was determined by whole-body counting of the emissions from 144Ce-144Pr- or 169Yb-labeled 239PuO2. Lung doses were calculated for each dog from these data. The lung doses ranged from 0.21 to 1200 Gy for 144Ce FAP and 1.6 to 58 Gy for 239PuO2. Dogs with doses to the lung of about 60 Gy or greater from 144Ce or about 2 Gy or greater from 239PuO2 had an increased incidence of lung carcinomas. In dogs exposed to 144Ce FAP, three organs were targets for neoplasia: lung, tracheobronchial lymph nodes, and heart. The insoluble FAP carried to the lymph nodes draining the lung delivered high radiation doses to the nodes and adjacent heart, resulting in hemangiosarcomas of these organs. In the lung, high radiation doses induced hemangiosarcomas and carcinosarcomas. At lower doses, carcinomas of various histological patterns were induced in the lung. In dogs exposed to 239PuO2, the lung was the sole target organ for neoplasia. Nearly all of these neoplasms were carcinomas of various histological patterns. These results indicated that relatively low doses of alpha-particle radiation can induce pulmonary cancers, but relatively large doses of beta-particle radiation are required. In addition, inhaled beta-particle emitters can also induce cancers in lung-associated lymph nodes and heart at these larger absorbed radiation doses.",Included
2568,"Coronary artery calcium scoring: influence of reconstruction interval and reconstruction increment using 64-MDCT OBJECTIVE: Assessment of coronary artery calcification is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification. However, a scanning protocol for modern MDCT has not been established. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the reconstruction interval within diastole and the reconstruction increment on the coronary calcium score., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 40 consecutive patients Agatston scores and volumetric scores were assessed using a 64-MDCT scanner. The patients were assigned to two groups at random with 20 patients each: in group A, collimation was 64 x 0.6 mm; in group B, it was 20 x 1.2 mm. All CT examinations were performed with retrospective ECG gating. For each patient, five data sets were created throughout diastole (50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, and 70% of the R-R interval). For each reconstruction, two data sets were calculated with a reconstruction increment of 3.0 and 1.5 mm, respectively. For all reconstructions, the mean Agatston scores and volumetric scores +/- SD and the coefficient of variance were assessed. Furthermore, for each reconstruction, patients were assigned a percentile rank that described the level of cardiovascular risk., RESULTS: Four patients had to be excluded from the study because no coronary calcium was detected on any of the reconstructions. In both groups, the mean Agatston score was not significantly different between reconstruction increment 3.0 mm and reconstruction increment 1.5 mm (group A, 112.1 +/- 92.5 and 114.3 +/- 93.6, p = 0.28; group B, 164.8 +/- 203.0 and 169.4 +/- 207.9, p = 0.29, respectively). However, in two cases, very small calcified lesions in the circumflex coronary artery were only detected using a reconstruction increment of 1.5 mm. In both groups, the mean coefficient of variation was not significantly different at reconstruction increment 1.5 mm (group A, 11.4 +/- 8.2; group B, 12.5 +/- 7.6) and reconstruction increment 3.0 mm (group A, 14.8 +/- 9.3; group B, 14.2 +/- 9.1; group A, p = 0.18; group B, p = 0.48). Based on the reconstruction increment and reconstruction interval, 77% of the patients (n = 14) in group A were assigned to one risk group and 23% (n = 4) to two different risk groups according to percentile strata. In group B, 83% of the patients (n = 15) were assigned to one risk group and 17% (n = 3) to two different risk groups. In contrast to the Agatston score, the volumetric score was significantly higher in both groups at reconstruction increment 1.5 mm (group A, 105.4 +/- 78.5 mm3; group B, 153.8 +/- 182.5 mm3) compared with reconstruction increment 3.0 mm (group A, 90.0 +/- 73.11 mm3; group B, 138.2 +/- 166.8 mm3; p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Using a 64-MDCT scanner, the calcium score calculated from different reconstructions within early diastole is variable, but the difference can be minimized using overlapping slice reconstructions. The variation does not lead to a different risk estimation in most patients. In patients with mild coronary calcifications, the use of overlapping slices may help to detect small calcified plaques. Furthermore, we recommend the use of ECG-controlled tube current modulation to reduce the radiation exposure.",Excluded
2496,"The single institutional outcome of postoperative radiotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer Purpose: This study was conducted to observe the outcomes of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in single institution. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2002 to 2013, 78 patients diagnosed with NSCLC after curative resection were treated with radiotherapy alone (RT, n = 48) or concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT, n = 30). The indications of adjuvant radiation therapy were N2 node positive (n = 31), close or involved resection margin (n = 28), or gross residual disease due to incomplete resection (n = 19). The median radiation dose was 57.6 Gy (range, 29.9 to 66 Gy). Result(s): Median survival time was 33.7 months (range, 4.4 to 140.3 months). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 49.5% (RT 46% vs. CCRT 55.2%; p = 0.731). The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 45.5% (RT 39.4% vs. CCRT 55.3%; p = 0.130). The 3-year local control rate was 68.1% (RT 64.4% vs. CCRT 77.7%; p = 0.165). The 3-year DMFS rate was 56.1% (RT 52.6% vs. CCRT 61.7%; p = 0.314). In multivariate analysis, age >=66 years and pathologic stage III were significant poor prognostic factors for OS. Treatment failure occurred in 40 patients. Four patients had radiologically confirmed grade 3 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): In NSCLC, adjuvant RT or CCRT after curative surgery is a safe and feasible modality of treatment. OS gain was seen in patients less than 66 years. Postoperative CCRT showed a propensity of achieving better local control and improved disease-free survival compared to RT alone according to our data.Copyright © 2014 The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
1587,"Parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: preserved parotid function after IMRT on quantitative salivary scintigraphy, and comparison with historical data after conventional radiotherapy PURPOSE: To evaluate the parotid function after parotid-sparing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: From March 2003 to May 2004, 16 patients with nonmetastatic NPC underwent parotid-sparing IMRT. Eight of these patients had Stage III or IV NPC based on the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. The post-IMRT parotid function was evaluated by quantitative salivary scintigraphy and represented by the maximal excretion ratio (MER) of the parotid gland after sialogogue stimulation. The parotid function of 16 NPC patients who were previously treated with conventional radiotherapy was reviewed as the historical control., RESULTS: In the parotid-sparing IMRT group, all 16 patients were alive and without cancer at the end of follow-up period (median, 24.2 months). The mean parotid MER was 53.5% before radiotherapy, 10.7% at 1 month post-IMRT, and 23.3% at 9 months post-IMRT. In the conventional radiotherapy group, the mean parotid MER was 0.6% at 6 to 12 months postradiotherapy. The difference was statistically significant (23.3% vs. 0.6%, p<0.001, Mann-Whitney test). In the IMRT group, the mean parotid doses ranged from 33.2 Gy to 58.8 Gy (average, 43.9 Gy). The correlation between the mean parotid dose and the percentage decrease of parotid MER at 9 months post-IMRT (dMER) was statically significant (p=0.008, Pearson correlation)., CONCLUSIONS: Although the mean parotid doses are relatively high, the significant preservation of parotid function is achieved with IMRT for NPC patients. The significant correlation between mean parotid dose and parotid dMER demonstrates the dose-function relationship of the parotid gland.",Excluded

The linear energy transfers (LET infinity s) for the radiations were 90 +/- 5, 35 +/- 3, and 0.3 keV/micrometer, respectively. After irradiation, lenticular opacities were monitored through their incipient and/or clinical stages (less than or equal to 5 years) by slit-lamp biomicroscopy and scored with subjective, but well-defined, indices. Cataractogenesis, which progressed according to the model proposed by Rubin and Casarett (1968), was modified by radiation quality in the following ways. (1) The rate of development of the early (acute) stage increased with the LET infinity of the incident radiation; (2) at the intermediate (plateau) stage, the values for the relative biological effectiveness (r.b.e.) of the heavy ions were similar to those reported for proliferating cells in culture; (3) for a given intermediate level, the onset of late cataractogenesis occurred earlier the higher the LET affinity of the radiation involved.

We studied implant survival and functional outcomes of overdentures fabricated on implants placed immediately after removal of the lower dentition during ablative surgery or preceding primary radiotherapy (RT). Method(s): Inclusion criteria were primary head and neck cancer, dentate lower jaw, and indication for removal of remaining teeth. Two implants to support a mandibular overdenture were placed immediately after extraction of the dentition during ablative surgery, or prior to starting primary radiotherapy. Standardized questionnaires and clinical assessments were conducted (median follow-up 18.5 months, IQR 13.3). Result(s): Fifty-eight implants were placed in 29 patients. Four implants were lost (implant survival rate 93.1%). In 9 patients, no functional overdenture could be made. All patients were satisfied with their dentures.

2586,"Dynamic in vivo profiling of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy using canine patients as a model Time resolved data of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy elucidates the relation between damage, repair, and cell survival. While well characterized in vitro, little is known about the time-course of DNA damage response in tumors sampled from individual patients. Kinetics of DNA damage after radiotherapy was assessed in eight dogs using repeated in vivo samples of tumor and co-irradiated normal tissue analyzed with comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) immunohistochemistry. In vivo results were then compared (in silico) with a dynamic mathematical model for DNA damage formation and repair. Maximum %DNA in tail was observed at 15-60 min after irradiation, with a rapid decrease. Time-courses of gammaH2AX-foci paralleled these findings with a small time delay and were not influenced by covariates. The evolutionary parameter search based on %DNA in tail revealed a good fit of the DNA repair model to in vivo data for pooled sarcoma time-courses, but fits for individual sarcoma time-courses suffer from the heterogeneous nature of the in vivo data. It was possible to follow dynamics of comet tail intensity and gammaH2AX-foci during a course of radiation using a minimally invasive approach. DNA repair can be quantitatively investigated as time-courses of individual patients by integrating this resulting data into a dynamic mathematical model.Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

1348,"Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the p53 pathway A cell culture assay has been developed that detects and validates single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that populate the p53 pathway. One hundred thirteen EBV-transformed human B-lymphocyte cell lines obtained from a diverse population were employed to measure the apoptotic response to gamma radiation. Each cell line undergoes a reproducible, characteristic frequency of apoptosis, and the response of the population forms a normal distribution around a median of 35.5% apoptosis with a range from 12% to 58% apoptosis. Polymorphisms in the AKT1 and Perp genes significantly affect the frequency of apoptosis. The assay can detect both racial and sexual dimorphisms in these genes and has the ability to demonstrate epistatic relationships within the p53 pathway. The cell lines used in this assay provide biological materials to explore the molecular basis of the polymorphisms.Copyright © 2005 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",Included
1479,"Urinary stone disease: Comparison of standard-dose and low-dose with 4D MDCT tube current modulation OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the performance of standard-dose MDCT with that of low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation in patients with renal colic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Three hundred patients underwent 6- and 16-MDCT in 150 standard-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 95 mAs at 130 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 120 mAs at 120 kV) and 150 low-dose examinations (6-MDCT effective tube current, 51 mAs at 110 kV; 16-MDCT effective tube current, 70 mAs at 120 kV), all performed with 4D tube current modulation. Two experienced radiologists using a clinical workstation and blinded to scan parameters prospectively viewed the images from the 300 examinations. In a second session, one experienced radiologist and two first-year residents using a clinical workstation retrospectively reviewed images from 100 randomly selected standard-dose and 100 randomly selected low-dose examinations. RESULTS. Tube current modulation reduced effective tube current 25-31% in all examinations. Mean effective dose was 1.41-1.58 mSv for low-dose examinations, which reached additional dose reduction of 51.2-64.3% in comparison with standard-dose examinations. Excellent correlation existed between mean tube current and body mass index of the patients. Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.85-0.88 for all examinations. The sensitivity of low-dose examinations interpreted by two experienced reviewers was 97.3-98.6%; specificity, 93.5%; and accuracy, 95.3%. These findings were comparable with those for standard-dose examinations. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of low-dose examinations of overweight and obese patients reached similar high values: 97-100%, 100%, and 98-100%, respectively. Interobserver agreement for urinary stone detection was excellent between the two reviewers, with kappa values of 0.98 for the low-dose and 0.96 for the standard-dose examinations. An alternative diagnosis was identified in 15% and 16% of cases by two experienced radiologists in the two examinations groups. In the second interpretation session, the residents found an alternative diagnosis in only 10-12% of standard-dose examinations and only 4-5% of low-dose examinations. CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT with tube current modulation can be used as standard procedure in evaluation for urolithiasis, even in overweight and obese patients. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
3018,"18 Years' experience with high dose rate strontium-90 brachytherapy of small to medium sized posterior uveal melanoma Aim: To analyse local tumour control, radiation related complications, visual acuity, enucleation rate, and survival after brachytherapy of small to medium sized choroidal melanoma (CM) with a high dose rate (HDR) strontium-90 (Sr-90) applicator. Method(s): From 1983 until 2000, 98 eyes with CM were treated with Sr-90 brachytherapy. The main outcome measures were actuarial rates of the patients' survival, ocular conservation rate, tumour regression, complication rates, and preservation of visual acuity. End point rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): The median follow up time was 6.7 years (0.5-18.8 years). Actuarial melanoma free patient survival rate was 85% (SE 4.8%) after 18 years. Actuarial rate of ocular conservation and complete tumour regression was 90% (SE 3.8%) after 15 years. In 93% local tumour control was achieved, 88% showed a stable scar. Recurrence of the tumour on the border caused enucleation of six eyes (7%). In three cases (4%) retinal detachment was the end point. No cases of optic atrophy or of sight impairing retinopathy outside the treated area were found. Actuarial rate of preservation of visual acuity of 1/10 was 65% at 5 years and 45% at 15 years of follow up (SE 5.9% and 8.8%). Conclusion(s): Sr-90 brachytherapy is as effective as iodine or ruthenium brachytherapy for small to medium sized CM but causes fewer complications. The preservation of vision is better than with all other described radioisotopes. HDR Sr-90 brachytherapy can therefore safely be recommended for small to medium sized CM.",Excluded

Thirty-seven, (60.6%) had less than 10 years of experience in the laboratory. Only 28 (45.9%) had undertaken radiation protection training. Fifty-eight, (95.1%) consistently used lead aprons. Forty-seven, (77%) reported consistently using thyroid shields. Ten (16.4%) consistently used radiation protection eyeglasses, whilst 36 (59%) never used them.

The patients were followed for a median 10.2 years, with a five year minimum follow-up. The median preoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) improved from 42 points to 77 points postoperatively. In four hips the femoral component was further revised for non-union of the allograft and aseptic failure. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were removed because of infection. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were re-revised for host step-cut fracture. Junctional-union was observed in 44/49 hips. By defining success as an increase of HHS by 20 points or more, a stable implant and no need for any subsequent re-operations related to the allograft and /or the implant, a success rate of 76% was observed. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis predicted 79% rate of survival at 10 years and 75% rate of survival at 17 years, with the need for further revision of the allograft and/or implant as the end point. Three hips underwent re-attachment of the greater trochanter for trochanteric escape. Asymptomatic non-union of the greater trochanter was noticed in another three hips. Moderate allograft resorption was observed in four hips. Two fractures of the host step-cut occurred. There were four dislocations. Good long-term results with the use of large anatomic-specific femoral allografts justify their continued use in cases of revision hip arthroplasty complicated with severe femoral bone loss.",Excluded
1287,"Ionizing radiation causes a dose-dependent release of transforming growth factor alpha in vitro from irradiated xenografts and during palliative treatment of hormone-refractory prostate carcinoma PURPOSE: Characterize the radiation response for transforming growth factor (TGF) alpha shedding in vitro and in vivo. We also report the shedding of TGF alpha by patients undergoing irradiation for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: TGF alpha levels were determined by ELISA. DU145 xenografts were established on the flanks of athymic nu/nu mice. Expression of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the DNA repair proteins XRCC1 and ERCC1 were determined by Western analyses., RESULTS: Exposure to ionizing radiation results in a dose-dependent release of TGF alpha. Once released, TGF alpha stimulates EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling in unirradiated cells. Blockade of the EGFR with the tyrphostin AG1478 eliminates the up-regulation XRCC1 and ERCC1 by TGF alpha or irradiation. After irradiation, cells are refractory to additional transactivation of EGFR by additional irradiation for 8 to 12 hours. Irradiation during this refractory period does not increase the expression of XRCC1 or ERCC1. Ligand activation of EGFR is maintained during the refractory period. Irradiation of DU145 xenografts also results in the activation of ERK1/2, release of TGF alpha, and a similar refractory period. Ionizing irradiation also results in the release of TGF alpha for patients undergoing radiation therapy for hormone-refractory prostate cancer., CONCLUSIONS: Irradiation results in a dose-dependent increase in TGF alpha capable of enhancing the growth of DU145 xenografts. TGF alpha is also shed following radiation therapy of patients treated for hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Radiation transactivation of the EGFR produces a radio-refractory period, which lasts for several hours. During this period, additional irradiation fails to induce XRCC1, ERCC1, or additional TGF alpha release.",Included

Methods and Materials: The database of the Cancer Registry of Slovenia was used for the identification of patients. The inclusion criteria were as follows: bone marrow biopsy showing less than 10% plasma cells, normal skeletal survey, and immunohistochemically determined tumor monoclonality. Simulation/portal films were reviewed to assess the extent of elective nodal XRT. Result(s): Twenty-six patients with 31 tumors fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In 4 patients, nine metachronously appearing solitary tumors were diagnosed. The head-and-neck region and other body sites were the sites of origin of primary tumors in 84% and 16% of patients, respectively, whereas in the two regions, regional disease was seen in 15% and 60% of patients, respectively. Therapy was as follows: XRT, 12 patients; surgery and postoperative XRT, 15 patients; and surgery, 4 patients. Ultimate local and regional control rates were 90% and 97%, respectively, and MM developed in 2 (8%) patients. The 10-year disease-specific and overall survival rates were 87% and 61%, respectively. The analysis of the dose-effect relationship showed that more conservative treatment is justified: for macroscopic disease, 40-50 Gy (2 Gy/day), adjusted to the bulk of disease; for microscopic disease, 36-40 Gy; after R0 surgery, no XRT is required, but close observation is needed. No attempts should be made to treat uninvolved nodal regions. Using Bartl's histologic grading criteria, trends were detected in patients with higher tumor grades: regional lymph node involvement (p = 0.04) and shorter disease-specific survival (p = 0.08). Conclusion(s): Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a highly curable disease when XRT is used with or without previous surgery. The rate of conversion to MM is low. Moderate-dose XRT using limited fields is recommended. The prognostic value of Bartl's grading system needs further evaluation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.",Excluded
1971,"Masking responses to light in period mutant mice Masking is an acute effect of an external signal on an overt rhythm and is distinct from the process of entrainment. In the current study, we investigated the phase dependence and molecular mechanisms regulating masking effects of light pulses on spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. The circadian genes, Period1 (Per1) and Per2, are necessary components of the timekeeping machinery and entrainment by light appears to involve the induction of the expression of Per1 and Per2 mRNAs in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). We assessed the roles of the Per genes in regulating masking by assessing the effects of light pulses on nocturnal locomotor activity in C57BL/6J Per mutant mice. We found that Per1-/- and Per2-/- mice had robust negative masking responses to light. In addition, the locomotor activity of Per1 -/-/Per2-/- mice appeared to be rhythmic in the light-dark (LD) cycle, and the phase of activity onset was advanced (but varied among individual mice) relative to lights off. This rhythm persisted for 1 to 2 days in constant darkness in some Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice. Furthermore, Per1-/-/Per2-/- mice exhibited robust negative masking responses to light. Negative masking was phase dependent in wild-type mice such that maximal suppression was induced by light pulses at zeitgeber time 14 (ZT14) and gradually weaker suppression occurred during light pulses at ZT16 and ZT18. By measuring the phase shifts induced by the masking protocol (light pulses were administered to mice maintained in the LD cycle), we found that the phase responsiveness of Per mutant mice was altered compared to wild-types. Together, our data suggest that negative masking responses to light are robust in Per mutant mice and that the Per1-/-/Per2-/- SCN may be a light-driven, weak/damping oscillator.

3262,"Incidence of dementia among atomic-bomb survivors--Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study Radiotherapy has been reported to cause neuropsychological dysfunction. Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation. Although we found no relationship between radiation exposure and the development of dementia among atomic bomb survivors exposed at >or=13 years old in this longitudinal study, effects on increased risk of early death among atomic bomb survivors will be considered.",Included
555,"Chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection: an experience with 22 patients The authors present their experience of chest wall reconstruction after full thickness resection in 22 patients. The patients are from a series of 80 patients treated by chest wall resection from 1967 to 1989. Whether performed on breasts still in place, for recurrent disease, or for radiation-induced lesions (which are often associated), the defect created by complete resection of the chest wall layers causes difficulties. Large cutaneous flaps, often including the opposite breast were used at the beginning of the series. Then came omentum associated to Mersilene mesh and myocutaneous flaps. The results, in terms of comfort and local control are acceptable, even though surgery is only palliative for cancer patients. We feel that full thickness chest wall resection is the only effective treatment for some primary and recurrent malignant tumors and for extensive thoracic radionecroses. Such procedures are designed to improve the patient's quality of life even if they do not actually prolong survival. The goals guiding the reconstruction programme are: (1) the restoration of a stable parietal rigidity; and (2) the reconstruction of long lasting superficial layers.",Excluded
1836,"Flow cytometry-based assay for determination of teleost cytotoxic cell lysis of target cells BACKGROUND: The nonradiometric assays previously developed to detect cellular cytotoxic activity have been hindered by many difficulties. Among the problems are the requirement for expensive commercial kits and the use of techniques that produce high background noise and decreased sensitivity. In addition, these assays did not account for bidirectional apoptosis (activation-induced cell death [AICD]). Most attempts to derive cytometry-based cytotoxicity assays have been unsuccessful because individual effectors and targets could not be identified (i.e., ""separated"") using gating techniques., METHODS: In the present study, teleost nonspecific cytotoxic (NCC) and mammalian target cells were each sufficiently different in size to identify them by flow cytometry (FCM). Using appropriate gating and discriminator techniques, these two cell populations were differentiated based on scatter properties and propidium iodide (PI) binding. Total capacity for PI binding was obtained by permeabilization of the targets with ice-cold acetone. Spontaneous PI binding was relatively low. This technique detected cytotoxicity at effector-to-target ratios (E:T) of 1:1 and after only 30 min cocultivation., RESULTS: Tilapia NCC from peripheral blood kill human transformed target cells by necrosis and apoptosis as identified by PI binding. Maximum killing of HL-60 targets (approximately 100%) occurred by 180 min cocultivation. For the same time, the killing of IM-9 did not exceed 60%. Almost 90% of IM-9 targets are lysed following 14 h of cocultivation. The maximum killing of both HL-60 and IM-9 targets was observed at a 25:1 E:T ratio after 14 h. Comparisons of the chromium(>51) release assay with flow detection of cytotoxicity revealed that FCM detected 55% lysis of the target cells compared with 2% cytotoxicity by chromium release, after a cocultivation time of 240 min., DISCUSSION: FCM detection of (teleost) NCC lysis of target cells using PI uptake is more sensitive than standard chromium release assays. This level of sensitivity was observed because NCC and targets were sufficiently different in size such that they could be resolved by scatter plots. Using FCM, cytotoxicity was detected earlier and at lower E:T ratios than previously reported for chromium release assays. Although tilapia were reported previously to be not capable of lysing IM-9 targets by chromium release detection, the more sensitive method of FCM detected cytotoxicity using PI uptake. HL-60 lysis by tilapia NCC exhibited saturable kinetics but occurred at different times post-cocultivation. Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
1406,"Comparative evaluation of the in vitro micronucleus test and the comet assay for the detection of genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation The genotoxic effects of X-ray radiation on human lymphocytes were measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay (comet assay) and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) test; both were carried out in vitro on isolated human lymphocytes in order to compare the relationship and sensitivity of these two detecting methods. The radiation-doses were 0.00, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 and 2.00 Gy. In the comet assay, the average comet length (38.6+/-0.8 microm) of 0.05 Gy was significantly longer than that (29.4+/-1.1 microm) of 0 Gy (P<0.01), moreover, the average comet length increased with the dose of X-ray radiation. In the CBMN, both the average micronucleus rate (MN) and micronucleated cell rate (MNC) of 0.05 Gy were 11.5+/-4.5 per thousand, which showed no difference with that (7.5+/-0.5 per thousand) of 0 Gy (P>0.05). The lowest dose, which induced significant increase of average MN and MNC, was 0.25 Gy. The average MN and MNC rates increased with radiation-dose. The results showed that there was correlation between SCGE and CBMN, and the sensitivity of SCGE was significantly higher than that of CBMN.",Included

The obtained results were compared with a control group. Besides that subgroups were isolated taking into account the sex of the studied subjects and duration of their work with X-ray equipment (over five years and below five years). In the workers handling X-ray equipment and in the isolated subgroups of women and men, the index of spontaneous NBT reduction turned out to be statistically significantly higher than that in the control group. In the group of studied workers the index of latex-stimulated NBT reduction was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. Taking into account the duration of work with X-ray equipment in the subgroups of women and men working for over five years, the lowest index of phagocytes was noted. On the basis of the obtained results the following conclusions were formulated: 1. In workers handling X-ray equipment disturbances occur of peripheral blood neutrophil metabolism assessed in the NBT test. 2. Neutrophil phagocytic activity is weakened in persons working over five years with X-ray equipment.",Included
2618,"The association between chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors in atomic bomb survivors Atomic bomb (A-bomb) radiation is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic CVD risk factors. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also known to be a risk factor for CVD and little is known whether CKD is associated with A-bomb radiation. To examine whether CKD is associated with CVD risk factors or with A-bomb radiation in A-bomb survivors, we classified renal dysfunction in 1,040 A-bomb survivors who were examined in 2004-2007 as normal [n = 121; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]; mild (n = 686; eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); moderate (n = 217; eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); or severe (n = 16; eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Also, we diagnosed subjects in the moderate and severe renal dysfunction groups as having CKD (n = 233; eGFR <59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking and drinking habits, we looked for an association between renal dysfunction and hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and between renal dysfunction and A-bomb radiation. Hypertension [odds ratio (OR), 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.20, P = 0.009]; DM (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.23-2.61, P = 0.002); hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.14, P = 0.008); and MetS (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.32-2.63, P < 0.001) were associated with CKD (moderate/severe renal dysfunction), and hyperlipidemia and MetS were also associated with mild renal dysfunction. CKD (OR/Gy, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.01-1.63, P = 0.038) and severe renal dysfunction (OR/Gy, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.63-6.25, P < 0.001) were significantly associated with radiation dose.

2517,"The risk of level IB nodal involvement in oropharynx cancer: Guidance for submandibular gland sparing irradiation Purpose Xerostomia remains a common side effect of head and neck irradiation. Conflicting data exist regarding the likelihood of level IB involvement for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC), and data are limited on this risk in patients with human papillomavirus-positive disease. This study examined surgically treated OPSCC to determine the risk of pathologic level IB nodal involvement and to identify a cohort of patients in whom ipsilateral level IB radiation therapy may be safely omitted. Methods and materials A total of 102 submandibular nodal dissections were identified (92 ipsilateral and 10 contralateral) in 92 patients from 2010 to 2016 in those undergoing primary surgical treatment and dissection of ipsilateral level IB lymph nodes. Radiographically positive cases were excluded. Retrospective chart review was used for data collection, and the rate of pathologic level IB involvement was determined. Results The ipsilateral level IB nodal station had negative imaging and pathologically positive nodes at rates of 4.3% in OPSCC and 5.3% in human papillomavirus-positive OPSCC. Positive node burden in the ipsilateral neck at stations other than IB appeared to correlate with the risk of pathologic positive IB (pIB+) nodes: 50% of pathologically IB-negative patients had 2 or more positive nodes versus 75% of pIB+ patients who had 4 or more positive nodes. Conclusions Our data indicate a low risk of pathologic level IB involvement in early-stage OPSCC. High positive node burden in stations near level IB may be associated with a higher chance of pathologic level IB involvement.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Radiation Oncology",Excluded
851,"The effect of chronic low-level exposure on hair damages of radiation workers According to chronic exposure of radiation workers during their work experience,this study was an attempt to assess the damage caused by radiation on the hair of radiation workers. In this study the total Skin and Hair Analyzing System capable of registering polarized images was used for measuring hair parameters (hair thickness,hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil). Hair management software ,Skin Management Software and also 150X,700X lenses were used to measure the hair parameters. The study included one questionnaire which it's face validity and content validity was approved by pilot study and some professional experts. The participants were 152 hospital personnel and were divided into radiation exposed group (radiotherapy technicians,nuclear medicine technicians) and control group (nurses) and were homogenized based on age,work situation,work time,work experience and baldness (family history). Results showed that chronic exposure causes the reduction of hair thickness in female radiation workers than nurses. The hair root,hair nutrition,hair status and hair oil in groups showed no significant difference to each other. However,there was no significant difference in hair parameters between male radiation workers and male non radiation workers. Although attention to safety in working with radiation has increased,damage caused by radiation has not yet been reduced to zero. Results of the study showed that chronic exposure may cause damage to the hair of radiation workers. The reason may be inadequate training of technologists and their high workload.Copyright © 2016,International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.",Included
2709,"Meal replacement in isolated and confined mission environments: Consumption, acceptability, and implications for physical and behavioral health Strategies that reduce food system mass without negatively impacting food intake, acceptability, and resulting astronaut health and performance are essential for mission success in extreme operational environments such as space exploration. Here, we report the impact of substituting the spaceflight standard breakfast with energy equivalent, calorically-dense meal replacement bars (MRBs) on consumption, acceptability, and satiety and on associations with physical and behavioral health outcomes in high-performing subjects completing 30-day missions in the isolated and confined operational environment of NASA's Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA) habitat. MRB implementation was associated with reduced daily caloric intake, weight loss, and decrements in mood and neurobehavioral functioning, with no significant impacts on somatic symptoms and physical functioning. Food acceptability ratings suggest that flavor, texture, and menu fatigue attributed to limited variety are contributing factors, which are exacerbated by a daily implementation schedule. Meal replacement strategies for short-duration missions are operationally feasible, moderately acceptable, and can contribute to the practical goal of mass reduction, but more work is needed to define and optimize flavors, variety, and implementation schedules that sustain adequate nutrition, physical and behavioral health, and operational performance over time in isolated, confined, and extreme mission environments.Copyright © 2020",Excluded

A new scanner that combines a 0.23 mm spatial resolution, a new generation of iterative reconstruction, fast gantry rotation time and the intracycle motion-correction algorithm to improve the temporal resolution was recently introduced in the clinical field. Material(s) and Method(s): We enrolled 105 consecutive patients with chronic AF who performed CCTA with a whole-heart coverage high-definition CT scanner (16-cm z-axis coverage with 256 detector rows, 0.28 s gantry rotation time). Five of them were excluded for impaired renal function. Patients were randomized between a double acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 1)or a single acquisition protocol (50 patients, group 2). The image quality, coronary segment interpretability and effective dose (ED)of CCTA were assessed. Result(s): The mean HR during the scan was 85.6+/-21 bpm in group 1 vs. 83.7+/-23 bpm in Group 2, respectively (p < ns). In group 2, overall image quality was high and comparable with that of group 1 (Likert scale =3.2 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 1.2, p = ns, in group 1 and 2, respectively). Coronary interpretability was high and similar between the two groups (97.5% and 97.1% in group 1 and 2, p = ns, respectively). Mean ED was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (5.3 +/- 1.8 mSv vs. 2.7 +/- 0.7 mSv, p < 0.001).

We found that, on average, the density of epidermal melanocytes 14 days after exposure to 2 minimal erythemal dose (MED) SSUVR was twofold higher than baseline (unirradiated) skin. However, the change in epidermal melanocyte counts among people carrying germline MC1R variants (97% increase) was significantly less than those with wild-type MC1R (164% increase; P = 0.01).

We investigated the clinical features of GI toxicity after CRT in patients with LAPC and examined the effect of GI hemorrhage on survival. Method(s): Patients enrolled in this study had received CRT for pathologically proven LAPC. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. Result(s): A total of 156 patients with LAPC (median age, 65 years; range, 39 to 90 years) who received treatment between August 2005 and March 2009 were included in this study. The most common GI toxicities were ulcer formation (25.6%) and hemorrhage (25.6%), and the most common grade 3 to grade 5 GI toxicity was hemorrhage (65%). The origins of GI hemorrhage were gastric ulcer (37.5%), duodenal ulcer (37.5%), and radiation gastritis (15.0%). The independent risk factor for GI hemorrhage was tumor location in the pancreatic body. The median overall survival of the patients with a GI hemorrhage was 13.8 months (range, 2.8 to 50.8 months) and was not significantly different from that of patients without GI hemorrhage.

OBJECTIVE(S): To describe a single-center experience on the transition to a radial-first approach for neurovascular procedures, focused on diagnostic angiographies, and to compare the differences in terms of length of procedure within the first 5 mo of its execution. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective review of a prospective maintained cerebrovascular registry at an academic institution within the United States, to identify the expected adoption curve required to transition to a transradial route first approach focused mainly on diagnostic procedures. The 5 mo of experience were divided into 4 quartiles evenly distributed in time. The primary outcome was the total length of procedure. Secondary outcomes were access failure, radiation dose, the usefulness of ultrasound assistance and complications. RESULT(S): A total of 121 transradial procedures were performed: 113 diagnostic angiographies (93%) and 8 therapeutic interventions (7%). We identified 6 access failures (5%) and 1 complication (1%). The mean length for diagnostic angiographies was 24 +/- 10 min, and for therapeutic procedures was 58 +/- 19 min. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the total length of procedures after the first quartile.

Although similar findings have been observed in populations exposed to low-dose, protracted radiation, such studies lack information on cigarette smoking history, a potential confounder. In a cohort of 106 068 U.S. radiologic technologists, we examined the association between estimated cumulative lung absorbed dose from occupational radiation exposure and lung cancer mortality. Poisson regression models, adjusted for attained age, sex, birth cohort, pack-years smoked and years since quitting smoking, were used to calculate linear excess relative risks (ERR) per 100 mGy, using time-dependent cumulative lung absorbed dose, lagged 10 years. Mean cumulative absorbed dose to the lung was 25 mGy (range: 0-810 mGy). During the 1983 to 2012 follow-up, 1090 participants died from lung cancer. Greater occupational radiation lung dose was not associated with lung cancer mortality overall (ERR per 100 mGy: -0.02, 95% CI: <0-0.13). However, significant dose-response relationships were observed for some subgroups, which might be false-positive results given the number of statistical tests performed. As observed in other studies of radiation and smoking, the interaction between radiation and smoking appeared to be sub-multiplicative with an ERR per 100 mGy of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.01-1.15) for those who smoked <20 pack-years and -0.03 (95% CI: <0-0.15) for those who smoked >=20 pack-years.

This study evaluated the relation of post-RT parotid gland changes with the dose received. Method(s): Data from 18 NPC patients treated by radiotherapy between 1997 and 2001 were collected. Parotid gland volumes were measured and compared between their pre-RT and post-RT CT images; both sets of CT were conducted with the same scanning protocol. Doppler ultrasound was used to assess the haemodynamic condition of the glands after radiotherapy. Doppler ultrasound results were compared against 18 agematched normal participants. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the patients'comments of xerostomia condition. Radiotherapy treatment plans of the participants were retrieved from the Eclipse treatment planning system from which the radiation doses delivered to the parotid glands were estimated. The correlations of parotid gland doses and the post-RT changes were evaluated. Result(s): The post-RT parotid glands were significantly smaller (p<0.001) than the pre-RT ones. They also demonstrated lower vascular velocity, resistive and pulsatility indices (p<0.05) than normal participants. The degree of volume shrinkage and subjective severity of xerostomia demonstrated dose dependence, but such dependence was not definite in the haemodynamic changes. Conclusion(s): It was possible to predict the gland volume change and subjective severity of xerostomia based on the dose to the parotid glands for NPC patients. However, such prediction was not effective for the vascular changes. The damage to the gland was long lasting and had significant effects on the patients' quality of life. © 2011 The British Institute of Radiology.",Included

Our preliminary tests show 50% (6/12) frequency of allelic loss at the D5Mit143 locus in thymic lymphomas induced by gamma-irradiation of the mice from (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c backcross. Yet, in gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas from the backcross made in opposite direction, namely, (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13, the analysis with the DSMit143 marker revealed low incidence of the loss of heterozygosity, 6.7% (15). The D5Mit143 locus resides in the distal part of chromosome 5, close to the telomere. Allelic loss of heterozygosity at the D5Mit143 locus showed strain specificity. In each case, the lost allele derived from the CcS-13 resistant strain.

2049,"Factors governing prepulse inhibition and prepulse facilitation of the acoustic startle response in mice The influence of prepulses on the acoustic startle response (ASR) was measured in three inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J, 129/SvHsd, and AKR/OlaHsd, and one hybrid strain produced by crossing wild mice and NMRI mice. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), i.e. reduction of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the interval between prepulses and startle stimuli was in the range of 37.5-100 ms. Prepulse facilitation (PPF), i.e. increase of ASR by prepulses, was maximal when the prepulse preceded the startle stimulus by 12.5 ms. PPI increased with increasing prepulse SPL, PPF first increased then decreased when prepulse SPL was increased. Percent PPI was independent from startle stimulus SPL. All strains showed a long-term increase of PPI when tested for several days; one strain (129) also showed an increase of PPF over days. The present results clearly show that PPI and PPF are independent processes, which add to yield the final response change. PPF and the observed long-term changes of PPI and PPF are stronger expressed in mice than have been observed in rats under similar conditions. Since there were significant differences between the strains of mice with respect to PPI and PPF, genetically different strains of mice are a promising tool to study these two processes.

219,"Electron beam radiation for conjunctival squamous carcinoma PURPOSE: To describe the authors' technique and preliminary results using electron beam radiation as rescue therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea.
METHODS: A retrospective review comprised of an interventional case series of patients with pathologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea, who had failed multiple standard treatments and underwent electron beam radiation therapy. Outcomes, radiation-related complications, and adverse effects were documented. Mortality and local control rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier survival probability method.
RESULTS: Eight patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 6 (75%) were men and 2 (25%) were women, with ages ranging from 38 to 65 years (mean 50 years). One tumor (12.5%) was classified as T2N0M0, 6 (75%) were classified as T3N0M0, and one (12.5%) was classified as T4N0M0. Follow up from electron beam radiation therapy ranged from 3 to 72 months (mean 30.25 months). The most common side effect was erythema and edema of the eyelids with diffuse transient eyelash loss, seen in all patients. Tumor local control and regression after electron beam radiation therapy were noted in 6 patients (75%); recurrence was noted in 2. There was neither metastatic spread nor tumor-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors report a small case series where local tumor control was achieved with electron beam radiation therapy for recalcitrant squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva and cornea. This approach may be considered for patients who fail conventional therapy.",Excluded
540,"Comparison of three fractionation schedules in radiotherapy for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma Background/Aim: Radiotherapy is widely accepted as the treatment of choice for early glottic squamous cell carcinoma (EGSCC), although it varies greatly with respect to dose, dose per fraction, and treatment techniques. The study aim was to evaluate the use of accelerated fractionation strategy (AFS) for EGSCC in standard clinical practice. Patients and Methods: Patients treated with definitive radiotherapy for EGSCC between 2008 and 2019 were retrospectively identified and received either conventional fractionation, hypofractionation, or hyperfractionation. Result(s): One hundred six patients were analyzed, and 19, 71, and 16 patients underwent conventional fractionation, hypofractionation, and hyperfractionation, respectively. The median follow-up was 56 months. The 5-year local control and overall survival rates were 79% and 83%; 78% and 79%; and 87% and 77%, respectively, and no significant difference was observed between the fractionation schedules. Conclusion(s): Our findings confirmed the utility of AFS in standard clinical practice and support its use for patients with EGSCC.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded
498,"Estimation of the displacement of cardiac substructures and the motion of the coronary arteries using electrocardiographic gating Purpose: The aim of this study was to quantify the displacement of cardiac substructures, including the anterior myocardial territory (AMT), left ventricle, and coronary arteries during a normal cardiac cycle. Material(s) and Method(s): Computed tomography (CT) images with retrospective electrocardiographic gating of 17 eligible patients were obtained. All images were reconstructed automatically for the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases. CT scanning without contrast at a random phase and a selected vertebral body were used as references to measure three-dimensionaldisplacements of the cardiac substructures. Result(s): The displacement between the end-diastolic and end-systolic phases (Dd-s) was greater than that between the end-systolic and random phases and between the end-diastolic and random cardiac phases. The largest displacements for the heart were in the left, posterior, and inferior directions with an average Dd-s of approximately 4-6 mm. The average Dd-s for the AMT and left ventricle was 1.2-2.7 mm in the anterior and right directions, 4.3-7.8 mm in left and posterior directions, and 4.9-6.3 mm in superior and inferior directions. For the coronary arteries, the average Dd-s was 2.8-5.9 mm in the anterior-posterior direction, 3.5-6.6 mm in left-right direction, and 3.8-5.3 mm in the superior-inferior direction. Inter-observer agreement was excellent for the heart, AMT, and left ventricle (kappa coefficient, >0.75 for all) and good for most coronary arteries in three dimensions (kappa coefficient, 0.511-0.687). The Dd-s did not differ significantly between men and women. Conclusion(s): Most average displacements of the cardiac substructures and coronary arteries were 3-8 mm in three dimensions. These findings will be useful to accurately estimate the radiation dose to cardiac substructures during thoracic radiation and to evaluate the risk of radiation-related heart disease. © 2013 Tan et al.

1614,"Laboratory longevity and competitiveness of Dacus ciliatus Loew (Diptera: Tephritidae) following sub-sterilizing gamma irradiation The effect of a sub-sterilizing gamma radiation dose on Dacus ciliatus adults was investigated to assess the suitability of the sterile insect technique (SIT) as an alternative method to control this pest. Late pupae (48 h prior to adult emergence) from a laboratory strain were irradiated with 120 Gy of gamma rays emitted by a 60Co source. Following adult emergence, the mortality of irradiated and non-irradiated cohorts was recorded. Over a period of 50 days after emergence, no significant negative effects of irradiation upon the longevity of male or female laboratory flies were observed. A laboratory competitiveness study (Fried test), using irradiated laboratory and wild males at a ratio of 3:1 was conducted to assess the ability of irradiated males to reduce the egg hatch rates of a wild population. The overall competitiveness was found to be ca. 0.32, suggesting a reduced, but satisfactory, quality of irradiated laboratory as compared with wild males. Based on the above findings, we calculated and proposed effective male release ratios for field application of SIT against D. ciliatus.",Excluded
2466,"What is new in the clinic of emphysematous pyelonephritis? INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, fortunately rare, potentially fatal necrotizing pyelonephritis with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from side pain to septic shock. The majority of cases occur in diabetics with poor glycemic control, while a small percentage may be due to urinary tract obstruction. The disease shows a high mortality rate (19-43%). Escherichia coli is the main causative agent (80%). Diagnosis of EPN should be supported by radiologically. In X Ray, psoas muscle shadow is wiped out in the same side and gas bubble can be observed in renal anatomical locations. Ultrasonograpy is inadequate; intravenous pyelography is not preferable due to the need of contrast material. The best imaging technique is computer tomography (CT) to show renal gas forming and associated tissues. The traditional treatment is parenteral antibiotics treatment and surgical treatment. Surgical treatment including percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) and nephrectomy. In this text, our five patients diagnosed with EPN were evaluated with the reviewing of the present literature. MATERIAL & METHODS: The patients' demographic data, clinical presentation, investigation findings, treatment, and outcome were retrospectively studied. Gas forming was reported in CT for all patients. Urine cultures, white blood cell, sedimentation and C reactive protein levels were collected. We applied a parenteral treatment which consists of ceftriaxone 1 gr 2x1 and metronidazole 500 mg 2x1 for 14 day to all patients. RESULT(S): Our patients consist of three women and two men. The mean age was 62 (range 51-82). Four patients had kidney stone and three of them had second type Diabetes Mellitus as co morbid factors. The most common clinical findings were tachycardia, fever and flank pain. The patients' Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli with a significant colony count. Radiological examination gave a diagnosis of EPN. While 3 patients were successfully treated by medical therapy alone, 1 had double J stenting according to ureterorenoscopy and 1 had ultrasound-guided PCD. The mean hospitalization period was 16 days (range 14-21). All patients were discharged with recovery. CONCLUSION(S): EPN predominantly affects female diabetics and immunocompromised patients. However, obstruction is another predisposing factor in non diabetic patients. Escherichia coli was found to be the causative organism in all the patients. Treatment comprised of resuscitation, normalization of serum electrolytes and blood sugars, administration of parenteral antibiotics, and relieving ureteric obstruction if present. Only the medical treatment can be a safe strategy in selected cases. Unlike the present literature, we think that EPN is not so mortal disease in today's conditions due to progress in medical care including the early diagnosis and treatment procedures.",Excluded
3246,"Radiation exposure to staff in intensive care unit with portable CT scanner Background. Bedside radiological procedures pose a risk of radiation exposure to ICU staff. The perception of risk may increase the degree of caution among the health care staff and raise new barriers preventing patients from obtaining prompt care. Objective. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual cumulative radiation dose to individual ICU staff. Methods. In this prospective study, forty subjects were required to wear thermoluminescent dosimeter badges during their working hours. The badges were analyzed to determine the exposure after 3 months. Results. A total of 802 radiological procedures were completed at bedside during the study period. The estimated annual dosage to doctors and nurses on average was 0.99 mSv and 0.88 mSv (p < 0.001), respectively. Residents were subjected to the highest radiation exposure (1.04 mSv per year, p = 0.002). The radiation dose was correlated with day shift working hours (r = 0.426; p = 0.006) and length of service (r = - 0.403; p < 0.01). Conclusions. With standard precautions, bedside radiological procedures - including portable CT scans - do not expose ICU staff to high dose of ionizing radiation. The level of radiation exposure is related to the daytime working hours and length of service.Copyright © 2016 Zhichao Xie et al.",Excluded
687,"The use of a fully integrated electronic medical record to minimize cumulative lifetime radiation exposure from CT scanning to detect urinary tract calculi In order to determine the effects of implementation of an electronic medical record on rates of repeat computed tomography (CT) scanning in the emergency department (ED) setting, we analyzed the utilization of CT of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB) for the detection of urinary tract calculi for periods before and after the implementation of a hospital-wide electronic medical record system. Rates of repeat CT scanning within a 6-month period of previous scan were determined pre- and post-implementation and compared. Prior to implementation, there was a 6-month repeat rate of 6.2 % compared with the post-implementation period, which was associated with a 6-month repeat rate of 4.1 %. Statistical analysis using a two-sample, one-tailed t test for difference of means was associated with a p value of 0.00007. This indicates that the implementation of the electronic medical record system was associated with a 34 % decrease in 6-month repeat CT KUB scans. We conclude that the use of an electronic medical record can be associated with a decrease in utilization of unnecessary repeat CT imaging, leading to decreased cumulative lifetime risk for cancer in these patients and more efficient utilization of ED and radiologic resources. © 2013 Am Soc Emergency Radiol.",Excluded
2197,"Multidrug resistance determinants in acute myeloid leukemia developed in persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chernobyl accident The results of multidrug resistance determinants expression analysis on leukemic cells of 56 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by immunophenotyping are presented. Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival. Defects in pathways of drug-induced apoptosis and function of pump, that actively effluxes drugs could contribute significantly to developing drug resistance in radiation-associated AML.",Included
1881,"Effect of chromosome size on aberration levels caused by gamma radiation as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful technique for detecting genomic alterations at the chromosome level. To study the effect of chromosome size on aberration formation, we used FISH to detect initial damage in individual prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) of gamma-irradiated G0 human cells. A linear dose response for breaks and a nonlinear dose response for exchanges was obtained using a chromosome 1-specific probe. FISH detected more chromosome 1 breaks than expected from DNA based extrapolation of Giemsa stained PCC preparations. The discrepancy in the number of breaks detected by the two techniques raised questions as to whether Giemsa staining and FISH differ in their sensitivities for detecting breaks, or is chromosome 1 uniquely sensitive to gamma-radiation. To address the question of technique sensitivity, we determined total chromosome damage by FISH using a total genomic painting probe; the results obtained from Giemsa-staining and FISH were nearly identical. To determine if chromosome 1 was uniquely sensitive, we selected four different sized chromosomes for paint probes and scored them for gamma-ray induced aberrations. In these studies the number of chromosome breaks per unit DNA increased linearly with an increase in the DNA content of the chromosomes. However, the number of exchanges per unit of DNA did not increase with an increase in chromosome size. This suggests that chromosome size may influence the levels of aberrations observed. Extrapolation from measurements of a single chromosome's damage to the whole genome requires that the relative DNA content of the measured chromosome be considered.",Excluded
300,"Estimation of radiation exposure of retrospective gated and prospective triggered 128-slice triple-rule-out CT angiography CT has become an important role in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain to exclude an aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism and acute coronary artery syndrome. However, the additional radiation exposure is a cause of concern and dose saving strategies should be applied, if possible. To estimate effective dose of retrospective gated and prospective ECG-triggered triple-rule-out computed tomography angiography (TRO-CTA). An Alderson-Rando-phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used for dose measurements. Exposure was performed on a 128-slice single source scanner. The following scan parameters were used (retrospective ECG-gated): 120 kV, 190 mAs/rot., collimation 128x0.6 mm, rotation time 0.3 s. Protocols with a simulated heart rate (HR) of 60 and 100 bpm were performed using the standard ECG-pulsing as well as MinDose. Additionally, a prospective triggered TRO-CTA was acquired (HR 60 bpm). The estimated effective dose of retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA ranged from 7.4-13.4 mSv and from 10.1-17.5 mSv for men and women, respectively. Due to radiosensitive breast tissue, women received a significant increased effective dose of up to 64.7% +/- 0.03% (p = 0.028) compared to men. MinDose reduces radiation exposure of up to 33.0% +/- 6.5% in comparison to standard ECG-pulsing (p < 0.001). The effective dose increased significantly with lower heart rates (p < 0.001). Prospective ECG-triggered TRO-CTA showed an effective dose of 5.9 mSv and 8.2 mSv for men and women, respectively. Compared to retrospective ECG-gated TRO-CTA a significant dose reduction was observed (p < 0.001). Due to the significant different dose exposure, scan protocols should be specifically adapted in a patient- and problem-oriented manner.",Excluded

This study evaluated the clinical utility of nimotuzumab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, used concurrently with radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Methods This open-label study randomized 92 treatment-naive patients (1:1) with advanced SCCHN into chemoradiation (CRT +/- nimotuzumab) or radiation (RT +/- nimotuzumab) group by investigator's discretion; these were further randomized into CRT + nimotuzumab or CRT and RT + nimotuzumab or RT groups, respectively. Treatment included 6 cycles each of cisplatin (50 mg/week), nimotuzumab (200 mg/week), and RT (total dose, 60-66 Gy). Response (tumor size reduction) was assessed at Month 6 post-treatment and survival, at Month 60. Results Forty and 36 patients in the chemoradiation and radiation groups, respectively (intent-to-treat population) were evaluated. Overall response at Month 6 post-treatment was 100% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 70% with CRT, 76% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 37% with RT. At Month 60, overall survival was 57% with CRT + nimotuzumab, 26% with CRT (P = 0.03), 39% with RT + nimotuzumab, and 26% with RT (P > 0.05). Median overall survival was not reached for CRT + nimotuzumab; it was 21.94 months for CRT (P = 0.0078), 14.36 months for RT + nimotuzumab, and 12.78 months for RT (P = 0.45). Risk of death was 64% lower with CRT + nimotuzumab than with CRT (95%CI: 0.37, 1.56), and 24% lower with RT + nimotuzumab than with RT (95%CI: 0.16, 0.79).

Patients, methods: Retrospective study of 1538 patients who received their first RIT in our department for autonomous thyroid nodules (ATN), autonomous multinodular goiter (AMG) or Graves' disease (GD) between November 1999 and January 2011. Pretherapeutic measurements were performed at any combination of 24 h, 48 h and 6 days after 131I administration. Post-therapy dosimetric measurements were performed in 12 h intervals until discharge. Teff was determined through monoexponential curve fitting. Result(s): Pretherapeutic Teff values based on measurements at 24 h and 48 h, 24 h and 6 d, 48 h and 6 d as well as on day 24 h, 48 h and 6 d yielded implausible (< 2 d or > 8 d) values for Teff, in 60.4%, 25.7%, 29.1 and 21.4% of available calculations, respectively. The plausible results showed significant, clinically relevant and sometimes considerable overestimations of Teff. Using empirically determined fixed disease specific Teff values resulted in a better congruence between the pre- and posttherapeutic dosimetry results. 24 h measurements were marginally more accurate than 48 h ones in AMG and GD whereas 48 h measurements were marginally more accurate in ATN; these differences are however not clinically relevant. 6 d measurements are clearly less accurate than those after 24 h or 48 h. Conclusion(s): In ATN, AMG and GD, pretherapeutic dosimetry can be performed by a single uptake measurement at 24 h or 48 h using a fixed, disease specific value for Teff. Additional later measurements do not yield a further clinically relevant contribution to accuracy of pretherapeutic dosimetry.Copyright © Schattauer 2015.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on serum ccf-DNA levels and ccf-mtDNA fragments (mtDNA-79 and mtDNA-230) of interventional cardiologists working in high-volume cardiac catheterization laboratory to assess their possible role as useful radiation biomarkers. We enrolled 50 interventional cardiologists (26 males; age = 48.4 +/- 10 years) and 50 age- and gender-matched unexposed controls (27 males; age = 47.6 +/- 8.3 years). Quant-iT TM dsDNA High-Sensitivity assay was used to measure circulating ccf-DNA isolated from serum samples. Quantitative analysis of mtDNA fragments was performed by real-time PCR.

1128,"Three-dimensional surface imaging for detection of intra-fraction setup variations during radiotherapy of pelvic tumors PURPOSE: Surface-based image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) allows positioning and/or monitoring patients in 3 dimensions (3D), without the use of ionizing radiation. In this study, we report on intra-fraction motion measured by acquisition of multiple images of 3D body surfaces., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients treated for pelvic tumors were enrolled. Setup variations (SV) through three consecutive body surfaces acquired by the optical IGRT system Align-RT (Vision-RT, London, UK) were analyzed before, during and at the end of treatment delivery. Displacements along the main axes (X, Y and Z) from initial (I) to mid-treatment (MT) and final (F) acquisitions were recorded. Time and direction of SV were assessed., RESULTS: A total of 6272 images from 792 fractions of 29 patients were available. The main source of misalignment was between I and MT acquisition (p < 0.001). The dominant SV direction was the vertical one (Z axis), with mean SV of -1.20 +/- 0.06 mm and -1.55 +/- 0.06 mm for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, respectively. The Y mean components of SV were, respectively, -0.95 +/- 0.10 mm and -1.0 +/- 0.10 for I-MT and I-F acquisitions, while the X deviations were 0.07 +/- 0.08 mm for I-MT and 0.26 +/- 0.08 mm I-F., CONCLUSION: Three-D surface imaging for patient setup monitoring highlighted remarkable mobility of patients during RT session, especially in the anterior-posterior direction (Z axis). The largest magnitude in patient movements occurred during the first part of delivery. These findings suggest that the initial setup control cannot not to be sufficient to guarantee treatment reproducibility, especially for long-lasting RT treatments.",Excluded
1710,"Identification of a novel mutation in ATP13A2 associated with a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia Objective To establish molecular diagnosis for a family with a complicated form of autosomal recessive hereditary spastic paraplegia with intellectual disability, cognitive decline, psychosis, peripheral neuropathy, upward gaze palsy, and thin corpus callosum (TCC). Methods Physical examinations, laboratory tests, structural neuroimaging studies, and exome sequence analysis were carried out. Results The 3 patients exhibited intellectual disability and progressive intellectual decline accompanied by psychiatric symptoms. Gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness appeared at the ages of 20s-30s. Brain MRI revealed TCC with atrophic changes in the frontotemporal lobes, caudate nuclei, and cerebellum. Exome sequence analysis revealed a novel homozygous c.2654C>A (p. Ala885Asp) variant in the ATP13A2, a gene responsible for a complicated form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (SPG78), Kufor-Rakeb syndrome, and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. The predominant clinical presentations of the patients include progressive intellectual disability and gait difficulty with spasticity and pyramidal weakness, consistent with the diagnosis of SPG78. Of note, prominent psychiatric symptoms and extrapyramidal signs including rigidity, dystonia, and involuntary movements preceded the spastic paraparesis. Conclusions Our study further broadens the clinical spectrum associated with ATP13A2 mutations.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
135,"Simulator training reduces radiation exposure and improves trainees' performance in placing electrophysiologic catheters during patient-based procedures Background: Currently, training in interventional electrophysiology is based on conventional methodologies, and a paucity of data on the usefulness of simulation in this field is available. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of simulator training on trainees' performance in electrophysiologic catheter placement during the early phase of their learning curve. Method(s): Inexperienced electrophysiology fellows were considered. A hybrid high-fidelity simulator (Procedicus VIST, version 7.0, Mentice AB Gothenburg, Sweden for Biosense Webster) was used. The following parameters were evaluated in 3 consecutive patient-based procedures before and after two training sessions of at least 1.5 hours on the simulator: (1) ability to place catheters in conventional recording/pacing sites (coronary sinus, His-bundle area, high right atrium, and right ventricular apex); (2) amount of help provided by the supervisor (scale from 1-3; 3 for maximal help); (3) fluoroscopy time; and (4) positioning time. Result(s): Seven fellows performed 168 catheter placements during 42 patient-based procedures with no complications. Comparing parameters before and after simulator training, there was a significant reduction in the mean amount of help and in fluoroscopy and positioning times per placement: from 1.71 +/- 1.24 to 0.42 +/- 0.68 (P <.001), from 121 +/- 88 seconds to 76 +/- 54 seconds (P <.001), and from 175 +/- 138 seconds to 102 +/- 74 seconds (P <.001), respectively. Overall fluoroscopy time per patient decreased from 567 +/- 220 seconds to 305 +/- 111 seconds (P <.0001). Improvement appeared to be related to simulator training alone and not to the previously performed patient-based procedures. Conclusion(s): During the early phase of the trainees' learning curve, simulator training significantly improves the independent trainees' performance with reduction in radiation exposure. © 2012 Heart Rhythm Society.

1365,"Proton beam therapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma: Practice patterns, outcomes, and the effect of biologically effective dose escalation Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and proton beam therapy (PBT) generally are safe and effective for non-operative hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To date, data comparing the two modalities are limited. We aimed to identify the practice patterns and outcomes of nonsurgical HCC cases treated definitively with either SBRT or PBT. Method(s): We queried the National Cancer Database for T1-2N0 HCC patients receiving PBT or SBRT from 2004 to 2015. Patients were excluded for any treatment other than non-palliative external beam radiotherapy. A multivariable binomial regression model identified patterns of SBRT/PBT use, and propensity-matched multivariable Cox regression assessed correlates of survival. Result(s): A total of 71 patients received PBT and 918 patients received SBRT (median follow-up 45 months). SBRT was used in 1.8% of nonoperative early stage HCC cases in 2004 and 4.2% of cases in 2015, whereas PBT was used in 0.1-0.2% of cases every year. The median biologically effective dose (BED) for SBRT and PBT was 100 Gy10 and 98 Gy10, respectively (OR =0.70, P=0.17). Factors predictive of receiving PBT included: white race, higher comorbidity score, higher education, metropolitan residence, tumors >5 cm and recent treatment (all P<0.05). Both PBT (HR =0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.78) and BED >=100 Gy10 (HR =0.61, 95% CI: 0.38-0.98) were independent predictors for longer survival. Conclusion(s): Although not implying causation and requiring prospective corroboration, PBT was independently associated with longer survival than SBRT, despite being delivered to HCC patients with multiple poor prognostic factors. PBT may also allow for safer BED escalation, which also independently associated with outcomes.Copyright © 2019 Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.",Excluded
3157,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

768,"Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction: Cumulative effect of cost, radiation, and turnaround time on the patient and the health care system OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to reiterate the predominance of CT in evaluating ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction in terms of cost-effectiveness, reduction of radiation exposure, and turnaround time as the measurement parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This retrospective study included patients 18 years and older with a history of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion who presented to the emergency department with symptoms of shunt malfunction and underwent shunt series radiography and head CT within 12 hours. Shunt revision occurring contemporaneously with imaging was defined as revision within 48 hours of the original imaging report. The effective radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product from the scanner with the standard conversion coefficient k (k = 0.0021 mSv/mGy x cm). The turnaround time for patients who underwent both head CT and shunt series radiography was calculated from time of the first study to the time of completion of the last study. RESULTS. There were 16 shunt revisions in 239 patients. The sensitivity of CT was 87.5%; specificity, 91.4%; positive predictive value, 42.4%; and negative predictive value, 99%. The sensitivity of shunt series radiography was 18.7%; specificity, 90.9%; positive predictive value, 13%; and negative predictive value, 93.9%. There were 223 observations of CT radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.87 +/- 0.45). There also were 223 observations of shunt radiography radiation dose per patient (mean, 1.57 +/- 0.60). The median turnaround time among patients undergoing CT and shunt radiography was 109 +/- 84 minutes. CONCLUSION. Shunt series radiography is a low-yield diagnostic imaging modality for identifying shunt malfunction and prolongs turnaround time, increases medical cost, and exposes patients to unnecessary radiation. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1773,"Control of unresectable recurrent anorectal cancer with gold-198 seed implantation Gold-198 seed implantation was performed in 18 patients with 19 sites of unresectable anorectal cancer. The seeds were placed under computed tomography guidance in the region of the sciatic notch in 14 patients (78%); one patient had two implants performed. Unresectable disease in the presacral region was implanted at laparotomy in two patients. Mean dose delivered was 10,791 cGy (range, 4376 to 22,000 cGy) to an average volume of 29 cm3 (range, 5.1 to 84.77 cm3). Median length of follow-up after implant was four months; eight patients (44%) were monitored for three months or less, and five patients (28%) were monitored for at least six months. Stabilization/regression of disease and symptoms in the implanted volume was accomplished in 17 (94%) of 18 patients. At last follow-up, three patients (17%) had no evidence of disease and three patients had stable disease in the pelvis, totaling 34% local control of pelvic disease. A total of 12 patients (66%) had progression of pelvic disease. Morbidity, as a result of the procedure or radiation dose, was limited. Gold-198 seed implantation accomplished stabilization of recurrent anorectal cancer and its symptoms without severe morbidity. Uncontrolled locoregional disease in the pelvis outside the implant volume is the primary cause of disease progress.",Excluded
1893,"A minimally invasive assay for individual assessment of the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity Ionizing radiation induces DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) which activate the ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through transcription of genes including CDKN1A (p21) and BBC3 (PUMA). This pathway prevents genomic instability and tumorigenesis as demonstrated in heritable syndromes (e.g., Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT); Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS)). Here, a simple assay based on gene expression in peripheral blood to measure accurately ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity is described. The expression of p21, Puma and Sesn2 was determined in blood from mice with different gene copy numbers of Atm, Trp53 (p53), Chek2 or Arf and in human blood and mitogen stimulated T-lymphocyte (MSTL) cultures from AT, AT carriers, LFS patients and controls, both before and after ex vivo ionizing irradiation. Mouse Atm/Chek2/p53 activity was highly dependent on the copy number of each gene except Arf. In human MSTL, an AT case, AT carriers and LFS patients showed responses distinct from healthy donors. The relationship between gene copy number and transcriptional induction upon radiation was linear for p21 and Puma and correlated well with cancer incidence in p53 variant mice. This reliable blood test provides an assay to determine ATM/CHEK2/p53 pathway activity and demonstrates the feasibility of assessing the activity of this essential cancer protection pathway in simple assays. These findings may have implications for the individualized prediction of cancer susceptibility. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
357,"Dynamic change of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease PURPOSE: To evaluate the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with dry eye disease (DED) by using a double-pass system., METHODS: Fifty-six patients with DED and 35 control subjects were included in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation of the ocular surface, using the Ocular Surface Disease Index, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival staining (Oxford scale), and Schirmer I test. Using the tear film analysis program of the Optical Quality Analysis System, we recorded the objective scatter index (OSI) every 0.5 seconds within a 20-second period with the subjects asked to blink freely. Several parameters were established to evaluate the dynamic alterations of optical quality and the effects of blinks: OSI standard deviation (SD), DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, blinking change (BC), blinking frequency (BF), and tolerant limitation (TL)., RESULTS: Patients with DED had significant alterations of optical quality compared to control subjects. The DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, BC, and BF were significantly higher and TL was significantly lower in DED patients than controls. Furthermore, the DELTAOSI and DELTAOSI/time were also significantly higher in patients with severe DED than patients with mild disease. In univariate analysis, both TBUT and corneal staining were correlated with DELTAOSI, DELTAOSI/time, and BC. In multivariate analysis, DELTAOSI/time was correlated to the corneal staining score., CONCLUSIONS: The double-pass system allowed the monitoring of the dynamic changes of optical quality in patients with DED. Optical quality should be evaluated in patients with DED because these alterations cannot be determined from the classical DED clinical tests.",Excluded

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively investigated treatment outcomes and adverse events in 121 patients with advanced esophageal cancer who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy with CF-RT (n = 83) or DCF-RT (n = 38). In the CF-RT group, patients were administered cisplatin (70 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (700 mg/m2) for 5 days; in the DCF-RT group, patients were administered docetaxel (50 mg/m2), cisplatin (50 mg/m2), and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m2) for 5 days. The radiotherapy dose was 1.8-2 Gy per session, up to a total of 50-60 Gy. Result(s): The complete response (CR) rate was 37.8% in the CF-RT group and 52.6% in the DCF-RT group. Overall survival (OS) rates at 2 and 3 years were 45.0% and 37.5%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 62.9% and 56.7%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.032). Progression-free survival rates at 2 and 3 years were 44.1% and 36.9%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 45.0% and 45.0%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.10). Local control rates at 2 and 3 years were 59.1% and 54.6%, respectively, in the CF-RT group and 71.8% and 71.8%, respectively, in the DCF-RT group (p = 0.12). The incidence of Grade 3/4 leukopenia was 55.4% (n = 46) in the CF-RT group and 78.9% (n = 30) in the DCF-RT group, with a significant intergroup difference (p = 0.022). The incidence of Grade 3/4 neutropenia was 47.0% (n = 39) in the CF-RT group and 65.8% (n = 25) in the DCF-RT group, with a notable albeit not statistically significant difference between the groups (p = 0.054). There were no significant intergroup differences in anemia, thrombocytopenia, radiation-induced dermatitis, radiation esophagitis, or late adverse events. Conclusion(s): Rates of OS and CR were improved after treatment with DCF-RT compared with CF-RT. Although DCF-RT-treated patients had higher rates of leukopenia, treatment safety was ensured through proper management of myelotoxicity. DCF-RT is a promising treatment regimen for advanced esophageal cancer.Copyright © Ivyspring International Publisher.",Excluded
780,"The pattern and time course of somatosensory changes in the human UVB sunburn model reveal the presence of peripheral and central sensitization The ultraviolet B (UVB) sunburn model was characterized with a comprehensive battery of quantitative sensory testing (QST). Primary hyperalgesia in UVB-irradiated skin and secondary hyperalgesia in adjacent nonirradiated skin were studied in 22 healthy subjects 24h after irradiation with UVB at 3-fold minimal erythema dose of a skin area 5 cm in diameter at the thigh and compared to mirror-image contralateral control areas. The time course of hyperalgesia over 96 h was studied in a subgroup of 12 subjects. Within the sunburn area, cold hyperesthesia (P=.01), profound generalized hyperalgesia to heat (P<.001), cold (P<.05), pinprick and pressure (P<.001), and mild dynamic mechanical allodynia (P<.001) were present. The finding of cold hyperalgesia and cold hyperesthesia is new in this model. The sunburn was surrounded by large areas of pinprick hyperalgesia (mean+/-SEM, 218+/-32 cm(2)) and a small rim of dynamic mechanical allodynia but no other sensory changes. Although of smaller magnitude, secondary hyperalgesia and dynamic mechanical allodynia adjacent to the UVB-irradiated area were statistically highly significant. Primary and secondary hyperalgesia developed in parallel within hours, peaked after 24-32 h, and lasted for more than 96 h. These data reveal that the UVB sunburn model activates a broad spectrum of peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms and hence is a useful human surrogate model to be used as a screening tool for target engagement in phases 1 and 2a of drug development.

2649,"Further validation to support clinical translation of [18F]FTC-146 for imaging sigma-1 receptors Background: This study aims to further evaluate the specificity and selectivity of [18F]FTC-146 and obtain additional data to support its clinical translation. Method(s): The binding of [19F]FTC-146 to vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was evaluated using [3H]vesamicol and PC12A123.7 cells in an in vitro binding assay. The uptake and kinetics of [18F]FTC-146 in S1R-knockout mice (S1R-KO) compared to wild-type (WT) littermates was assessed using dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Ex vivo autoradiography and histology were conducted using a separate cohort of S1R-KO/WT mice, and radiation dosimetry was calculated from WT mouse data (extrapolated for human dosing). Toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats were performed with a dose equivalent to 250x the anticipated clinical dose of [19F]FTC-146 mass. Results and discussion: VAChT binding assay results verified that [19F]FTC-146 displays negligible affinity for VAChT (Ki = 450 +/- 80 nM) compared to S1R. PET images demonstrated significantly higher tracer uptake in WT vs. S1R-KO brain (4.57 +/- 1.07 vs. 1.34 +/- 0.4 %ID/g at 20-25 min, n = 4, p < 0.05). In S1R-KO mice, it was shown that rapid brain uptake and clearance 10 min post-injection, which are consistent with previous S1R-blocking studies in mice. Three- to fourfold higher tracer uptake was observed in WT relative to S1R-KO mouse brains by ex vivo autoradiography. S1R staining coincided well with the autoradiographic data in all examined brain regions (r2 = 0.85-0.95). Biodistribution results further demonstrated high [18F]FTC-146 accumulation in WT relative to KO mouse brain and provided quantitative information concerning tracer uptake in S1R-rich organs (e.g., heart, lung, pancreas) for WT mice vs. age-matched S1R-KO mice. The maximum allowed dose per scan in humans as extrapolated from mouse dosimetry was 33.19 mCi (1228.03 MBq). No significant toxicity was observed even at a 250X dose of the maximum carrier mass [19F]FTC-146 expected to be injected for human studies. Conclusion(s): Together, these data indicate that [18F]FTC-146 binds specifically to S1Rs and is a highly promising radiotracer ready for clinical translation to investigate S1R-related diseases.Copyright © 2015, Shen et al.",Excluded

Radiation dose rates were measured at 1 m from 50 patients, 24 men and 26 women, before and after the first void using a calibrated ionization chamber. The F-FDG was injected in the patients using a calibrated automatic dose injection system. Statistical analysis using hypothesis testing was carried out. Patients with BGL above 5 mmol/l had a higher AFE of 12.3% in comparison with 8.3% of the patients with BGL below 5 mmol/l. A statistically nonsignificant correlation (r=0.183, P<0.249) between AFE and BGL was found; a nonsignificant difference was found in the AFE measured among the male and female patients. The AFE measured was 12+/-6%, with a range of (2-30%). There was a wide variation in the first void time of 39+/-8 min, with a range of (17-68) min. A simple noninvasive measurement method is presented that enabled the estimation of the amount of F-FDG excreted from the patient during voiding.

Method(s): Thirteen consecutive patients with a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma were treated with limited PDT 6 min following a 1-min infusion with verteporfin (6 mg/m2 body surface area), using a diode laser (692 nm) and a single spot large enough to cover only the most prominent part of the tumor. Exposure time was 166 s in the first three patients and 83 s in the last ten patients, resulting in a radiance exposure of respectively 100 and 50 J/cm2. Result(s): In all 11 not previously conventionally treated patients, visual acuity improved following PDT treatment. The two remaining patients with prior radiation treatment both reported widening of the visual field and sharper vision, but did not show an increase in ETDRS vision. In all but four patients the tumor became ultrasonographically undetectable by the first follow-up visit at 6 weeks, with only a slight irregularity at the level of the previous tumor remaining. In four patients the residual tumor was still detectable, and they received a second treatment, following which the tumor flattened completely. In all patients the retinal detachment disappeared. Conclusion(s): The present series demonstrates that even limited, low-irradiance, single-spot photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is an effective first-line treatment for choroidal hemangiomas.",Excluded
90,"Effects of microwave radiation on thymocytes in mice at different power densities OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of microwave radiation on thymocytes in mice at different power densities. METHOD(S): The experimental animals were whole-body exposed to microwave radiation with frequency of 2,450 MHz, power density of 1, 5, 15 mW/cm(2) respectively 1 h everyday for 30 days. Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05). The percentages of G(2) + M phase thymocytes in both radiation groups (12.24% +/- 1.82%, 11.19% +/- 1.36%) were lower than that in control group (14.58% +/- 0.64%) (P < 0.01). Thymocytic apoptosis rates in the three experimental groups (7.18% +/- 0.99%, 10.06% +/- 1.58%, 9.45% +/- 0.92%) were higher than that in control (4.25% +/- 1.63%) (P < 0.01), but the evident difference between 5 mW/cm(2) and 15 mW/cm(2) was not found (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Sub-chronic microwave exposure (2 450 MHz, 5, 15 mW/cm(2)) could induce thymocyte apoptosis, cause pathological changes in thymus, and affect cell cycle progression, thus may inhibit the immune function of the animal.",Excluded
234,"Comparison of 51chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid and iohexol as blood markers for intestinal permeability testing in Beagle dogs (51)Chromium-labeled ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid ((51)Cr-EDTA) is the gold standard probe for assessing intestinal permeability (IP) in dogs, but exposure to radioactivity is a disadvantage. Iohexol is a safe contrast medium commonly used for medical imaging purposes and has been successfully applied more recently for the assessment of IP in animal models and humans. This study aimed at comparing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol as IP blood markers in dogs. A test solution containing (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol was administered intragastrically to seven healthy laboratory Beagle dogs, and percentage recoveries in serum were calculated. The strong linear association (correlation, r=0.76 and linear regression, y=0.03+5.04x) between (51)Cr-EDTA and iohexol supports the potential usefulness of iohexol as an IP blood marker in dogs.

Result(s): The PTV coverage in all comparative plans was similar. V 15 of the bowel in 3D, AP-PA and PA plans was 6.7 Gy (SD 6.47), 39.8 Gy (SD 11.4) and 37.3 Gy (SD15.7), respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean dose to both kidneys was 9.6 Gy (SD 4.8), 4.1 Gy (SD 3.9) and 4.6 Gy (SD 4.4) for appropriate plans (p = 0.002). Maximal dose to the spinal cord was 30.6 Gy (SD 2.1), 33.1 Gy (SD 9.8) and 37.7 Gy (SD 2) for 3D, AP-PA and PA plans. Conclusion(s): 3D conformal treatment planning of lumbar vertebral metastases was significantly better in term of bowel and spinal cord exposure compared to AP-PA and PA techniques. The exposure of the kidneys in 3D plans, while greater than in the comparative plans, did not violate accepted dose-volume thresholds. © 2013 Soyfer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1572,"Current psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety remain high for those who have rebuilt permanent homes following the Fukushima nuclear disaster Objective: The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 produced psychological reactions among evacuees. Despite the harsh situation, subsequently, there has been gradual progress in reconstruction, with more than half of the evacuees returning after the evacuation. Our hypothesis is that evacuee mental health will now be better due to new stable living conditions. This study aims to clarify the statuses of psychological distress, post-traumatic stress, and radiation health anxiety among evacuees who have rebuilt permanent homes after evacuation. Method(s): A cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 1600 residents was conducted in 2020. As primary outcomes, the survey measured psychological distress (Kessler 6), post-traumatic stress (post-traumatic stress four-item checklist), and radiation health anxiety. The data are compared for residents who have rebuilt permanent home and those who did not evacuate. Result(s): In the co-variant analysis, the statuses of psychological distress (p < 0.001), post-traumatic stress (p < 0.001), and radiation health anxiety (p < 0.001) are found to still be high, with significant differences when compared to those who did not evacuate. These results are still at an equivalent level for the continuing evacuation. Conclusion(s): Our findings may indicate a necessity for continuing disaster-related mental health activities even though the living conditions have improved.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

660,"A little to a lot or a lot to a little? An analysis of pneumonitis risk from dose-volume histogram parameters of the lung in patients with lung cancer treated with 3-D conformal radiotherapy PURPOSE: To determine whether a little dose to a large normal lung volume or a high dose to a small lung volume is more critical for induction of clinical pneumonitis. The second question is if dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters are more reliable, if the lungs are analyzed as separate organs or as a whole organ., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and DVH data from 49 patients treated for a thoracic malignancy using 3-D conformal treatment plans. 18 patients had developed a clinical pneumonitis (CTC II or III). The majority of patients (n = 48) received radiochemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin. Patients were generally treated 5 fx/week, single dose 2 Gy, using a two-series approach (shrinking field) up to a total dose of 60-70 Gy. For every individual patient, the overall dose distribution was recalculated in the Helax-TMS by means of adding dose plans according to the total dose applied in each series. The lungs were defined both as separate organs and as a whole organ. Low-dose volume ( 10-40 Gy, Vmod) and high-dose volume (> 40 Gy, Vhigh), as well as V10-V40 and mean lung dose (MLD) were defined from the cumulative DVH. Dose-effect relationships were fitted with a logistic regression model., RESULTS: Manifestation of clinical pneumonitis was within 3 months from termination of irradiation in all cases. For the ipsilateral lung, the incidence of pneumonitis was closely correlated to Vhigh. The pneumonitis rate increased from 13% up to 60%. By contrast, with increasing Vlow the pneumonitis rate dropped to < 10%. A similar but less pronounced effect was seen for the total lung. The lung volumes Vlow, Vmod and Vhigh of the ipsilateral, contralateral and whole lung were significantly correlated to the corresponding MLD. The incidence of pneumonitis increased with increasing MLD for the ipsilateral lung with a D50 of 32 Gy and a gamma 50 of 0.98. For the whole lung, the observed increase was less steep. MLD showed a close correlation to NTCP calculated by the Kutcher model. However, NTCP calculation overestimated the pneumonitis risk for the ipsilateral lung and underestimated the risk for the whole lung due to the steeper gradient. The logistic regression curve for the DVH parameters V10-V40 showed an increase of steepness toward higher doses. From the logistic regression curves, a DVH template indicating critical borders of V10-V40 was generated for the ipsilateral as well as for the total lung., CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that it is reasonable to disperse the dose outside the target volume over large areas in order to reduce the volumes of lung receiving > 40 Gy. Reducing the high-dose volume reduces the pneumonitis rate more than a corresponding reduction in the low-dose regions of the DVH. Landmarks for DVH optimization as defined in this analysis may serve as a basis for DVH contrains in IMRT planning. Separate organ analysis produced more reliable results and should be preferred to whole-organ analysis, if techniques mainly involving one side of the lung are applied. Further validation of these constraints is necessary prior to general recommendation.",Excluded
1371,"A study on radiation dose received by patients during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Background: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is considered as the method of choice for treatment of most stone diseases. The present study aims to evaluate radiation dose received by patients undergoing ESWL. Method(s): In total, 46 patients from both genders were referred to the Shohadaye Ashayer hospital of Khorramabad, Iran and were included in the present study. Patients were positioned in anteroposterior (AP) projection and along 30degree anterior oblique (AO) projection upon the X-ray fluoroscopy table and exposures were conducted. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used for radiation dose measurements. To evaluate the entrance surface dose (ESD), each TLD chip was taped on back of patient at the entrance surfaces of the X-ray beam. Result(s): The mean number of stones in each patient was 1.4. The stone sizes ranged from 7 to 29 mm, and a mean of 3200 pulses were need for each patient. The mean ESD in the postero-anterior (PA) and oblique X-ray beam entrance were obtained at 12.04 and 68.84 mGy, respectively. There was linear correlation between patient dose with fluoroscopy time, tube current (mA), tube potential (kVp) and patient position (P < 0.001); however, we found no strong correlation between patient dose with patient body mass (P = 0.837), number of shock wave pulses (P = 0.089), stone size (P = 0.773) and locations (P = 0.463). Conclusion(s): The data obtained in the current study are comparable with information available in the literature. They emphasized that ESWL exposes patients to much more radiation compared to those from conventional radiography and is in the range of computed tomography (CT) procedures. Therefore, following safety guidelines is recommended.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).",Excluded

1941,"Gamma Knife surgery anterior capsulotomy for severe and refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder Clinical article Object: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a challenging psychiatric condition associated with anxiety and ritualistic behaviors. Although medical management and psychiatric therapy are effective for many patients, severe and extreme cases may prove refractory to these approaches. The authors evaluated their experience with Gamma Knife (GK) capsulotomy in treating patients with severe OCD. Method(s): A retrospective review of an institutional review board-approved prospective clinical GK database was conducted for patients treated for severe OCD. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by at least one psychiatrist, and their condition was deemed refractory to pharmacological and psychiatric therapy. Result(s): Five patients were identified. Gamma Knife surgery with the GK Perfexion unit was used to target the anterior limb of the internal capsule bilaterally. A single 4-mm isocenter was used; maximum radiation doses of 140-160 Gy were delivered. All 5 patients were preoperatively and postoperatively assessed for clinical response by using both subjective and objective metrics, including the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS); 4 of the 5 patients had postoperative radiological follow-up. The median clinical follow-up was 24 months (range 6-33 months). At the time of radiosurgery, all patients had YBOCS scores in the severe or extreme range (median 32, range 31-34). At the last follow-up, 4 (80%) of the 5 patients showed marked clinical improvement; in the remaining patient (20%), mild improvement was seen. The median YBOCS score was 13 (range 12-31) at the last follow-up. Neuroimaging studies at 6 months after GK treatment demonstrated a small area of enhancement corresponding to the site of the isocenter and some mild T2 signal changes in the internal capsule. No adverse clinical effects were noted from the radiosurgery. Conclusion(s): for patients with severe OCD refractory to medications and psychiatric therapy, GK capsulotomy afforded clinical improvement.

3087,"The role of vitamin D in the carcinogenesis of breast and ovarian cancer The review evaluates the role of vitamin D in carcinogenesis. Based on ecological studies, the incidence of many cancers has been shown to be higher in northern countries, suggesting an association with latitude and solar radiation. Vitamin D produced in skinunder the influence of sun exposure may play a protective role in the process leading to cancer. Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic, mainly due to lack of knowledge that sun exposure in moderation is the major source of vitamin D for most human. After vitamin D was discovered to be the necessary element of nourishment to prevent rickets at the beginning of the twentieth century, the theory concerning its role has evolved. It is now recognized that vitamin D, and particularly its active form 1.25 (OH)2D, is an important hormone playing a crucial role in human homeostasis. 1.25(OH)2D3 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, inducecancer cell maturation, induce apoptosis, and decrease angiogenesis. Several studies suggested that living at higher geographical latitudes increased the risk of developing and dying of colon, prostate, breast and other cancers. People exposed to sunlight were noted to less likely develop cancer. Several studies evaluated circulating levels of 25(OH)D and its possible association with cancer. Case-control studies and laboratory tests have consistently demonstrated that vitamin D plays an important role in the prevention ofbreast cancer. Vitamin D supplementation is a much needed, low cost, effective, and safe intervention strategy for breast cancer prevention that should be implemented. It has been shown that vitamin D levels are lower in ovarian cancer patients. Low 25(OH) D concentration associated with lower overall survival rate might suggest for the important role of severe deficiency in more aggressive course of ovarian cancer. Testing for 25(OH)D in the standard procedure could help to find ovarian cancer patients with worse prognosis, who would benefit from special attention and supplementation. Vitamin D3 supplementation in moderate doses achieving 25(OH)D concentrations of 30-80ng/ml, can be recommended as many benefits may be expected, including decreased risk of developing cancer.",Excluded

The novel tSS was utilized to quantify targeted-PCI complexity., METHODS: We studied 420 consecutive patients who had PCI in our hospital. Two investigators independently measured tSS using the SYNTAX scoring algorithm. Patients were divided into three BMI (kg/m(2) ) subgroups: <25 (normal), 25-30 (overweight), and >30 (obese); and tSS tertiles: <5.5 (simple), 5.5-9 (moderate), and >9 (complex)., RESULTS: Obese patients were significantly younger and likely to have diabetes mellitus (DM). tSS positively correlated with RD for both genders, with median RD significantly higher in males (P < 0.0001). tSS correlated with RD in all three BMI subgroups (all P < 0.0001). Multivariate linear regression showed RD can be predicted by the formula: RD = -898 + 18 tSS + 49 BMI + 142 DM + 207 male., CONCLUSIONS: We report that tSS is a quantitative index of ""target-lesion"" PCI complexity, which is easy to measure with good reproducibility. tSS significantly and independently correlates with RD, although the strength of the association is less than for other predictors of RD (gender, diabetes, and BMI). tSS may be used to determine the RD from PCI and enhance patient risk-stratification when formulating a PCI strategy.

2529,"Normal tissue complication probability modeling for cochlea constraints to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy Background: Radiation-induced tinnitus is a side effect of radiotherapy in the inner ear for cancers of the head and neck. Effective dose constraints for protecting the cochlea are under-reported. The aim of this study is to determine the cochlea dose limitation to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck cancer (HNC) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Method(s): In total 211 patients with HNC were included; the side effects of radiotherapy were investigated for 422 inner ears in the cohort. Forty-nine of the four hundred and twenty-two samples (11.6%) developed grade 2+ tinnitus symptoms after IMRT, as diagnosed by a clinician. The Late Effects of Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT-SOMA) criteria were used for tinnitus evaluation. The logistic and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models were used for the analyses. Result(s): The NTCP-fitted parameters were TD 50 = 46.31Gy (95% CI, 41.46-52.50),GAMMA 50 = 1.27 (95% CI, 1.02-1.55), and TD 50 = 46.52Gy (95% CI, 41.91-53.43), m = 0.35 (95% CI, 0.30-0.42) for the logistic and LKB models, respectively. The suggested guideline TD 20 for the tolerance dose to produce a 20% complication rate within a specific period of time was TD 20 = 33.62Gy (95% CI, 30.15-38.27) (logistic) and TD 20 = 32.82Gy (95% CI, 29.58-37.69) (LKB). Conclusion(s): To maintain the incidence of grade 2+ tinnitus toxicity <20% in IMRT, we suggest that the mean dose to the cochlea should be <32Gy. However, models should not be extrapolated to other patient populations without further verification and should first be confirmed before clinical implementation.Copyright © 2015 Lee et al.",Excluded

We retrospectively compared the treatment results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent CRT (induction group, 32 patients) with those of concurrent CRT alone (concurrent group, 41 patients) in unresectable stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC patients. In induction group, 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (etoposide/ifosfamide/cisplatin: 24 patients, others: 8 patients) were followed by concurrent CRT (60 Gy/30 fractions, 6 mg/m 2 of cisplatin daily), while the same concurrent CRT was administered in concurrent group. Clinicopathologic characteristics including age, weight loss, histologic types, and clinical stage did not show significant differences between two groups except for a higher proportion of patients with ECOG performance status 2 in concurrent group (3% vs. 27%, p=0.015).

1434,"Facilitation of somatic calcium channels can evoke prolonged tail currents in rat hypoglossal motoneurons Voltage-dependent persistent inward currents (PICs) make an important contribution to the input-output properties of alpha motoneurons. PICs are thought to be mediated by membrane channels located primarily on the dendrites as evidenced by prolonged tail currents following the termination of a voltage step and by a clockwise hysteresis in the whole cell inward currents recorded in response to depolarizing then repolarizing voltage ramp commands. We report here, however, that voltage-clamp currents with these same features can be generated in isolated somatic membrane patches from rat hypoglossal motoneurons. Long-lasting (200-800 ms) tail currents after 1-s voltage-clamp pulses were observed in nucleated patches from 16 of 23 cells. Further, these somatic PICs display ""facilitation"" in response to conditioning depolarization as previously observed in whole cell recordings from intact neurons. Pharmacological tests suggest that the PICs were primarily mediated by Cav1 channels. Our results show that many of the features of persistent calcium currents recorded from intact motoneurons do not necessarily reflect a remote dendritic origin but can also be ascribed to the intrinsic properties of their Cav1 channels.",Excluded
306,"Diagnostic accuracy of 320-row computed tomography as compared with invasive coronary angiography in unselected, consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease Noninvasive coronary angiography with multislice computed tomography (CT) scanners is feasible with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. The radiation exposure associated with this technique, however, is high and concerns in the widespread use of CT have arisen. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of coronary angiography using 320-row CT, which avoids exposure-intensive overscanning and overranging. We prospectively studied 118 unselected consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA). All patients had 320-row CT within 1 week of ICA, which, together with quantitative analysis, served as the reference standard. Of the 65 out of 118 patients who were diagnosed as having CAD by ICA, 64 (98 %) were correctly identified at 320-row CT. Noteworthy, 320-row CT correctly detected CAD in 3 patients with atrial fibrillation and ruled out the disease in the other 8 patients. From 151 significant coronary stenoses detected on ICA, 137 (91 %) were correctly identified with 320-row CT. In the per-patient analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 98 and 91 %, respectively. In the per-vessel analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 93 and 95 %, respectively. In the per segment analysis, sensitivity and specificity of 320-row CT were 91 and 99 %, respectively. Diameter stenosis determined with the use of CT showed good correlation with ICA (P < 0.001, R = 0.81) without significant underestimation or overestimation (-3.1 +/- 24.4 %; P = 0.08). Comparison of CT with ICA revealed a significantly smaller effective radiation dose (3.1 +/- 2.3 vs. 6.5 +/- 4.2 mSv; P < 0.05) and amount of contrast agent required (99 +/- 51 vs. 65 +/- 42 ml, P < 0.05) for 320 row CT.

2520,"Detrimental effects of electron beam irradiation on the cowpea bruchid Callosobruchus maculatus BACKGROUND: Electron beam (eBeam) irradiation technology is an environmentally friendly, chemical-free alternative for disinfesting insect pests of stored grains. The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

Purpose: The goal of this study was to explore the outcomes of unilateral and bilateral approach percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) using CT-guidance in the treatment of severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 89 patients with severe osteoporotic single-level vertebral biconcave-shaped fracture who had undergone unilateral and bilateral PKP surgeries using CT-guidance at our hospital between June 2013 and June 2019, and followed for at least 1 year. All patients were divided into unilateral (the transverse process-pedicle approach, n = 49) and bilateral (the pedicle approach, n = 40) groups. We collected the clinical and radiological evaluation results during postoperative and last follow-up periods. Result(s): Our findings revealed that the surgery time for the unilateral group was significantly shorter than that of the bilateral group at P < 0.05. The amount of bone cement and radiation exposure of the unilateral group were significantly lesser than that of the bilateral group (P < 0.05). Relative to preoperative data, the values of the VAS score and Oswestry disability index (ODI) were significantly improved at 1 day after surgery and the last followup in the two groups (P < 0.05). Notably, the median height of vertebra at 1 day after surgery and the last follow-up in the unilateral group was significantly restored than that of preoperative data (P < 0.05). However, the median height of vertebra at the same time intervals in the bilateral group showed no significant change compared with preoperative data (P > 0.05). Furthermore, the rate of bone cement leakage and incidence of adjacent-level vertebra fracture were not significantly different in the two groups (P > 0.05). Finally, both groups can obtain an asymmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra. Conclusion(s): Compared to the bilateral PKP, unilateral PKP using CT-guidance in the treatment of the sOVBFs exhibits significantly shorter operation time, lesser radiation dose, and complications. Moreover, unilateral PKP can restore the median height of the vertebral body and eventually obtain a symmetrical distribution of bone cement in the vertebra.Copyright © 2021 Tan et al.",Excluded
249,"Inter-laboratory consistency and variability in the buccal micronucleus cytome assay depends on biomarker scored and laboratory experience: results from the HUMNxl international inter-laboratory scoring exercise The buccal micronucleus cytome (BMNcyt) assay in uncultured exfoliated epithelial cells from oral mucosa is widely applied in biomonitoring human exposures to genotoxic agents and is also proposed as a suitable test for prescreening and follow-up of precancerous oral lesions. The main limitation of the assay is the large variability observed in the baseline values of micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies mainly related to different scoring criteria. The aim of this international collaborative study, involving laboratories with different level of experience, was to evaluate the inter- and intra-laboratory variations in the BMNcyt parameters, using recently implemented guidelines, in scoring cells from the same pooled samples obtained from healthy subjects (control group) and from cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (treated group). The results indicate that all laboratories correctly discriminated samples from the two groups by a significant increase of micronucleus (MN) and nuclear bud (NBUD) frequencies and differentiated binucleated (BN) cells, associated with the exposure to ionizing radiation. The experience of the laboratories was shown to play an important role in the identification of the different cell types and nuclear anomalies. MN frequency in differentiated mononucleated (MONO) and BN cells showed the greatest consistency among the laboratories and low variability was also detected in the frequencies of MONO and BN cells. A larger variability was observed in classifying the different cell types, indicating the subjectivity in the interpretation of some of the scoring criteria while reproducibility of the results between scoring sessions was very good. An inter-laboratory calibration exercise is strongly recommended before starting studies with BMNcyt assay involving multiple research centers. Copyright © The Author 2016.

882,"Chromosome anomalies in mouse oocytes after irradiation We investigated the cytogenetic effects of X-rays on unfertilized mouse oocytes. NMRI females received an irradiation with 0,22.2,66.6,200, and 600 R during the preovulatory phase 3 hrs after HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin). This is a stage during oogenesis in which the oocytes pass from late dictyotene to diakinesis. Chromosome analysis was performed after ovulation at metaphase II. From these experiments we can draw the following conclusions: 1) X-rays induced during the preovulatory phase a high number of chromosome anomalies. Among these, structural anomalies prevail. 7 out of 144 ovulated oocytes in matched controls carried such an abnormality, whereas after irradiation we observed with 22.2, 66.6, 200, and 600 R, 11 out of 72, 34 out of 108, 89 out of 102, and 122 out of 124, respectively. 2) Irradiation seems also to affect the chromosome segregation during the 1. meiotic division, as we observed after 22.2, 66.6, and 200 R a total of 6 oocytes out of 204 with a supernummary chromosome. In controls, however, no hyperploidy was found in 143 ova. This increase, however, was not significant. 3) Chromosome anomalies, e.g. breaks and deletions that go back to a one-break event increased linearly with increasing dose. Exchanges, however, going back to two-break events fittest best to the linear-quadratic dose-response model. 4) The dose of 600 R seems to represents a kind of borderline in this experiment, because nearly all (122 out 124) carried at least one structural chromosome anomaly. It is also this dose after which the highest frequency of reciprocal translocations was observed in a hump-shaped slope in spermatocytes after irradiation of spermatogonia (Preston and Brewen, 1973). With an increasing dosage up to 1200 R the frequency of translocations decrease again. The elimination of cells, crossing this borderline, might be due to genetic or non-genetic effects. 5) The frequency of radiation-induced translocations per oocyte agrees with the frequency of translocations in human lymphocytes (Dolphin and Lloyd, 1974) after in vitro irradiation. 6) Significant, lower frequencies of structural chromosome anomalies were observed irradiating earlier stages of mouse oogenesis. These stages are dictyotene from females at the age of 3, or 6 weeks and prophase I-stages in female embryos on the 17th day of gestation. This result may be due to a lower sensitivity of these stages or to modifying events during the interval between irradiation and preparations.",Excluded
1095,"Clinical presentation of head and neck skin malignancies among albinos and value of basic surgical intervention Background: Radiation from sunlight may play a role in the clinical presentation of head and neck skin cancers in albinos. This study assesses the clinical presentation of such cancers and outcome of basic surgical treatment without primary repair of resulting defects. Method(s): An analysis of sites from head and neck affected by cancers using traditional anatomical landmarks was carried out. The frequency of involvement of each division in malignant skin changes was also documented and compared. Result(s): The eyes were not involved with any malignancy. With the head and neck region partitioned by a transverse line using the lateral canthus of the eye as landmark, the superior portion was found to be involved in 209 lesions, all (100 %) of which were successfully treated. The inferior portion had 119 but enjoyed 92.4 % success rate. With the head and neck region partitioned in the coronal plane using the lateral canthus of the eye as landmark, the posterior portion was involved in 282 lesions, of which 273 (96.8 %) were successfully treated. The anterior portion was involved in 46 lesions, all (100 %) of which were successfully treated. Conclusion(s): Hair appears to protect the skin beneath it from actinic damage and cancers among albinos. Failed treatment was recorded only among lesions on the cheek and neck.

420,"Effect of gamma radiation on resting B lymphocytes. II. Functional characterization of the antigen-presentation defect The effect of radiation on three discrete Ag-presentation functions in resting B cells was examined: 1) Ag uptake and processing, 2) expression of processed Ag in the context of functional class II molecules, and 3) provision of necessary co-stimulatory, or second,"" signals. Analysis of radiation's effect on B cell presentation of intact vs fragmented Ag or its effect on presentation by Ag-pulsed B cells indicated that damage to Ag uptake and processing could not account for the bulk of the radiation-induced Ag-presentation defect. Experiments with phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as an indirect measure of TCR occupancy suggested that irradiation caused a fairly rapid (within 1 to 2 h) decrease in the ability of the B cell APC to display a stimulatory combination of Ag and class II molecule. Ag dose-response analyses demonstrated that when presenting a fragment of the Ag pigeon cytochrome c to a T cell clone, 3000 rad-treated B cell APC were able to stimulate approximately 50% as much phosphatidylinositol turnover as unirradiated B cells. It was also found that, in contrast to their inability to initiate T cell proliferation, and similarly to chemically cross-linked splenocytes, heavily irradiated resting B cells plus Ag induced a state of Ag hyporesponsiveness in T cell clones. This effect on T cells had the same Ag- and MHC-specificity as did receptor occupancy required for proliferation, indicating that heavily irradiated resting B cells bear functional class II molecules. Co-culture of T cells with allogeneic B cells and syngeneic heavily irradiated B cells or chemically cross-linked splenic APC plus Ag resulted in T cell proliferation and interfered with the induction of the hyporesponsive state. This co-stimulatory function was radiosensitive in resting allogeneic B cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that the major functional consequences of radiation to resting B cell APC are a reduction in the effective display of Ag plus class II molecules and, probably what is more important, a loss in the ability to provide APC-derived co-stimulatory signals.""",Included
3027,"Early clinical outcomes for 3 radiation techniques for brain metastases: Focal versus whole-brain Purpose: To present our novel technique for brain metastases (low-dose whole brain radiation therapy [WBRT] with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) and focal, frameless stereotactic intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]) in the context of patterns of failure, dosimetry, acute toxicity, and overall survival for 3 different radiation techniques. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 92 patients undergoing radiation for brain metastases via the following: (1) ""prophylactic"" WBRT to a low dose (median 30 Gy) with an SIB to the gross tumor volume plus 2-3 mm margin (median dose 45 Gy) in 10-15 fractions; (2) focal, frameless image-guided stereotactic IMRT (S-IMRT) in 5 fractions to tumor only (median 30 Gy); or (3) conventional (c)WBRT using 2 lateral opposed beams in 10-15 fractions (30-37.5 Gy). The primary endpoints were local (LBC), distant (DBC), and total brain control (TBC) for each of the 3 types of brain radiation. Survival, toxicity, and dosimetry were reported as secondary endpoints. Result(s): LBC was achieved in 72%, 78%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. DBC (ie, no new brain metastases) was observed in 92%, 67%, and 81% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. TBC (LBC + DBC) was 72%, 67%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. No statistical difference in overall survival was observed (P = .067), and only 1 patient experienced biopsy proven radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): TBC after low-dose WBRT with SIB was acceptable and at least comparable to S-IMRT and cWBRT. SIB seems to be a safe and effective treatment strategy for patients with brain metastases and may efficiently combine the benefits of cWBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded

15,"Radioembolization of symptomatic, unresectable neuroendocrine hepatic metastases using yttrium-90 microspheres PURPOSE: To evaluate safety, efficacy, and symptom-control of radioembolization in patients with unresectable liver metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NETLMs)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients (mean age of 62 years) with treatment-refractory NETLMs underwent radioembolization using yttrium-90 ((90)Y) resin microspheres. Posttreatment tumor response was assessed by cross-sectional imaging using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and tumor-marker levels. Laboratory and clinical toxicities and clinical symptoms were monitored., RESULTS: The median activity delivered was 1.63 GBq (range 0.63-2.36). Imaging follow-up using RECIST at 3-month follow-up demonstrated partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease in 22.5, 75.0, and 2.5% of patients, respectively. In 97.5% of patients, the liver lesions appeared hypovascular or partially necrotic. The mean follow-up was 16.2 months with 40 patients (95.2%) remaining alive. The median decrease in tumor-marker levels at 3 months was 54.8% (chromogranin A) and 37.3% (serotonin), respectively. There were no acute or delayed toxicities greater than grade 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE (v3.0)]. No radiation-induced liver disease was noted. Improvement of clinical symptoms 3 months after treatment was observed in 36 of 38 symptomatic patients., CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with (90)Y-microspheres is a safe and effective treatment option in patients with otherwise treatment-refractory NETLMs. Antitumoral effect is supported by good local tumor control, decreased tumor-marker levels, and improved clinical symptoms. Further investigation is warranted to define the role of radioembolization in the treatment paradigm for NETLMs.",Excluded

Patients with plexopathies secondary to tumor or irradiation complained of pain in the ipsilateral lower extremity. Computed tomography of the pelvis was the most accurate method of documenting tumor in the region of the lumbosacral plexus.

Twelve of 23 patients had surgery as definitive treatment and the tumor recurred locally in all; seven of these 12 patients were subsequently salvaged by further surgery plus postoperative radiotherapy or by radiotherapy alone, with 58% ultimate local control. The remaining three patients had unresectable tumors at diagnosis and received radiation alone, with a local tumor control rate of 33%. Patients were also analyzed according to the extent of surgical resection prior to radiation therapy and according to radiation dose. Eighty-eight percent of completely resected, 50% of partially resected, and 44% of unresected tumors were locally controlled for an overall local control rate of 61%.

Method(s): Between December 2009 and January 2010, among 70 consecutive patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER who performed with 256-slice CT scanner, we included the patients with heart rate (HR) of <= 75 bpm and HR variation <= 10 bpm. Therefore, we included 24 patients obtaining with PGT (mean age, 58.8+/-16.2 years; 12 men and 12 women) and 24 patients obtaining with RGH (mean age, 57.2+/-14.5 years; 12 men and 12 women). Scan was obtained from apex to kidney level. For each of 15 segments indentified according to the American Heart association's segmental model, image quality was evaluated by a radiologist using a four point grading scale: grade 4, excellent and no motion artifacts; grade 3, good and minor stairstep or motion artifacts; grade 2, moderate and presenting artifacts but still diagnostic; and grade 1, poor and not diagnostic. For each scan, radiation dose and additional extracardiac findings were estimated. Diagnostic accuracy was also evaluated the 2 patients performed conventional angiography. The image quality results between PGT and RGH scans were compared using Mann-Whitney Test. Result(s): No statistically significant differences were evident between these two groups in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics. The difference of image quality between PGT and RGH scans was not statistically significant (p = 0.5843). The image quality was regarded as grade 4 for most segments in both PGT (96.7%, 348/360) and RGH scans (98.9%, 356/360). Mean effective radiation dose was 10.4+/-1.2 mSv in patients with PGT as compared to 23.0+/-4.6 mSv in patients with RGH. Additional extracardiac findings are 10 cases in patients with PGT including lung nodule, thyroid nodule. Conclusion(s): Prospective ECG-gated CTA by using the PGT is useful for patients with atypical chest pain who visited ER because it can reduce radiation dose to 54.8% while maintaining image quality and diagnostic accuracy in patients with HR less than 75 bpm, and evaluate the coronary arteries, aorta, pulmonary arteries, and entire intra-thoracic structures at the same time.",Excluded
828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded

Emphasis was placed on accurate and extensive year-long dosimetry with etch-track detectors in conjunction with careful questioning about historic patterns of in-home mobility. Conditional logistic regression was used to model the outcome of cancer on radon exposure, while controlling for years of residency, smoking, education, income, and years of job exposure to known or potential carcinogens. Smoking was accounted for by nine categories: never smokers, four categories of current smokers, and four categories of former smokers. Radon exposure was divided into six categories (model 1) with break points at 25, 50, 75, 150, and 250 Bq m, the lowest being the reference. Surprisingly, the adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were, in order, 1.00, 0.53, 0.31, 0.47, 0.22, and 2.50 with the third category significantly below 1.0 (p < 0.05), and the second, fourth, and fifth categories approaching statistical significance (p < 0.1). An alternate analysis (model 2) using natural cubic splines allowed calculating AORs as a continuous function of radon exposure. That analysis produces AORs that are substantially less than 1.0 with borderline statistical significance (0.048 < or = p < or = 0.05) between approximately 85 and 123 Bq m. College-educated subjects in comparison to high-school dropouts have a significant reduction in cancer risk after controlling for smoking, years of residency, and job exposures with AOR = 0.30 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.69), p = 0.005 (model 1).",Included

By X-ray examination, cartilage destruction is evaluated as a joint space narrowing (JSN). However, joint space narrowing is not a direct evaluation of cartilage. Objective(s): The aim of the study was to examine the finger joint cartilage by ultrasound (US) imaging and to compare it with JSN score in relation to clinical relevance. Method(s): We enrolled 27 RA patients in low disease activity or clinical remission (DAS28-CRP <2.7) and 21 healthy controls in this study. The cartilage thickness (CT) of metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of 2nd to 5th fingers was bilaterally visualized and measured from a dorsal view, with approximately 90 degrees flexion. In addition, JSN of finger were scored by van der Heijde- modified Sharp method. Result(s): In patients with RA, CT in MCP joints ranged from 0.0 to 0.8 mm (median 0.4 mm), and CT in PIP ranged from 0.0 to 0.4mm (median 0.2mm), respectively. The sum of total CT from 8 fingers ranged from 2.7 to 6.8 mm (median 4.7 mm), and there was a significant difference in CT, but not in JSN score, between male and female patients (5.6 versus 4.6, respectively, p=0.005). Healthy controls had the sum of total CT significantly thicker as compared with RA (p<=0.001). Importantly, CT was well correlated with JSN (r=-0.696, p<0.001). Although CT was not correlated with age, disease duration, DAS28-CRP, functional disability score, positivity of rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP-antibody, CT was reduced in RA patients with elevated serum matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) values compared with those with normal MMP-3 (3.9 versus 5.0, p=0.015).

2373,"Examination of the optimal temporal resolution required for computed tomography coronary angiography Sub-second multidetector-row computed tomography systems provide great potential for the further improvement of CT coronary angiography (CTCA). However, because the temporal resolution (TR) of such CT systems is insufficient, blurring and artifacts produced by fast cardiac motion remain as unresolved issues. Previous TR investigations of CTCA were based on the retrospective electrocardiogram-gated multisegment reconstruction technique. However, the results obtained may not necessarily be correct because the TR of multisegment reconstruction may not be substantial due to the insufficient periodicity of cardiac motion. The optimal TR required for better CTCA images was evaluated with use of a dual-source CT system, which has various substantial TR modes (83, 125, and 165 ms). CTCA images of 147 patients with heart rates (HRs) ranging from 36 to 117 beats/minute (bpm) were evaluated visually on a 4-point scale. Our results revealed not only that the 165-ms TR is sufficient for low HRs (<=60 bpm), but also that the 83- and 125-ms TRs are unnecessary for such HRs. The image quality with the 125-ms TR mode was acceptable for the left anterior descending artery, left circumflex artery, and right coronary artery at low to intermediate HRs (<=70 bpm). At high HRs (>70 bpm), the 83-ms TR mode resulted in an excellent image quality for all cases except those with very rapid RCA motion. Adequate TRs for a wide range of heart rates (52-106 bpm) are thus clarified. © 2013 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.",Excluded

After photoactivation with far red light, MLu facilitates production of cytotoxic oxygen radicals that mediate apoptosis. We assessed the safety and tolerability of phototherapy (PT) with MLu in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with stent deployment., METHODS AND RESULTS: An open-label, phase I, drug and light dose-escalation clinical trial of MLu PT enrolled 80 patients undergoing de novo coronary stent deployment.

Clinical evaluation, serial quantitative angiography, and intravascular ultrasound were performed periprocedurally and at 6 months follow-up. MLu PT was well tolerated without serious dose-limiting toxicities, and side effects (paresthesia and rash) were minor. No adverse angiographic outcomes were attributed to phototherapy., CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that coronary MLu PT seems safe, and the maximum well-tolerated MLu dose and range of tolerated light doses were identified.

3399,"The outcomes of one-stage treatment for multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture Background: Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are serious and complex knee injuries that are rare in clinical practice. The management is extremely challenging and controversial. The aim of this study is to describe a patient collective with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries in detail and to report the mid-term outcomes of a one-stage surgical treatment regarding subjective outcome scores, complications, knee instability, and ROM. Method(s): Eleven of 425 patients with multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus injuries admitted to our hospital were reviewed from July 2008 to May 2017. All patients underwent one-stage repair and reconstruction of multiple knee ligaments and extensor apparatus. The Lysholm knee score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score were adopted to evaluate the surgical effect preoperatively and at a minimum of 2 years' follow-up. Clinical data, including range of motion and knee stability, were also recorded at the final follow-up. Result(s): Ten patients were followed up with a mean time of 40 (range, 24-60) months. At the last follow-up, 8 patients had joint flexion range of motion greater than or equal to120 degrees, 2 patients had joint flexion range of motion of 100-120 degrees, and 1 patient had active knee extension limitation of 5 degrees. Stress radiographs showed that the mean differences in posterior displacement were reduced from 10.8 +/- 3.0 mm preoperatively to 2.0 +/- 2.5 mm at the last follow-up. There were significant improvements in stress radiographs from pre- to postoperative states for all patients with multiple knee ligament injuries. The Lysholm score ranged from 85 to 96, with a mean of 92.1 (compared with 33 before surgery, P < 0.05). The final IKDC scores were A in 2 patients (20%), B in 7 (70%), and C in 1 (10%). Nine of the 10 patients (90%) returned to their former activity level. Conclusion(s): Multiple knee ligament injuries combined with extensor apparatus rupture are rare. Single-stage management of the repair and reconstruction of multiple knee ligaments and extensor apparatus with proper rehabilitation is an effective and reliable procedure to restore knee stability and function.

No patient received PALN irradiation as the initial treatment. CEA and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) were measured before and after radiotherapy. PALN recurrence was detected by computer tomography (CT) scans. We analyzed the actuarial rates of PALN recurrence by using Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate analyses were carried out with Cox regression models. We stratified the risk groups based on the hazard ratios (HR)., RESULTS: Both pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL and SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 8.838), SCC-Ag levels >= 40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 12.551), and SCC-Ag levels of 10-40 ng/mL (p < 0.001, HR = 4.2464) were significant factors for PALN recurrence. The corresponding 5-year PALN recurrence rates were 51.5%, 84.8%, and 27.5%, respectively. The 5-year PALN recurrence rate for patients with both low (< 10 ng/mL) SCC and CEA was only 9.6%. CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL or SCC-Ag levels >= 10 ng/mL at PALN recurrence were associated with overall survival after an isolated PALN recurrence. Pretreatment CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL were also associated with survival after an isolated PALN recurrence., CONCLUSIONS: Pretreatment CEA >= 10 ng/mL is an additional risk factor of PALN relapse following definitive CCRT for SCC of the uterine cervix in patients with pretreatment SCC-Ag levels < 10 ng/mL. More comprehensive examinations before CCRT and intensive follow-up schedules are suggested for early detection and salvage in patients with SCC-Ag or CEA levels >= 10 ng/mL.",Excluded

Males with superior territories attracted two mates, whereas those with poor territories failed to attract any.

522,"Correlation between fracture healing status and euroqol score (EQ-5D) during conservative therapy for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures INTRODUCTION: EQ-5D is a standardized instrument utilized as a measure of health related quality of life outcome. There are few reports investigating the relationship between fracture healing status and EQ-5D after conservative treatment for painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHOD(S): Forty consecutive patients (5 male, 35 female, average age: 78) had fresh VCFs due to primary osteoporosis diagnosed by MRI. They were treated in hospital for 2 to 3 weeks by conservative therapy consisting of medication (NSAIDs, Alendronate, Calcitonin) and brace. EQ-5D and questionnaires were collected at pre-fracture (retrospective) and post-fracture at first visit, at discharge and after 12-week conservative therapy. Radiographic evaluation was conducted by flexion-extension X-ray and CT. Pseudoarthrosis was diagnosed when the intervertebral cleft was seen in both X-ray and CT, and there was a motion more than 3-degrees in flexion-extension X-rays. Correlations among fracture healing status, brace compliance, and EuroQOL score were investigated. Final follow-up rate was 85% (34/40). RESULT(S): There were 30 patients who could move by themselves (Group A), and other 10 patients who could not even turn over due to severe pain (Group B). EQ-5D at pre-fracture, post-fracture, discharge, and after conservative therapy were 0.9067, 0.5030, 0.7538, and 0.7688 in Group A, 0.7359, -0.0179, 0.5546, and 0.7948 in Group B, respectively. Post-fracture EQ-5D in Group B was significantly lower (p<0.0001). Pseudoarthrosis was found in 6 cases (18%), while the intervertebral cleft was observed in 41 at 12-weeks. All these 6 cases answered as the brace compliance, almost all day"". Average EQ-5D in these 6 cases was 0.2657 at first visit and 0.689 after 12-week therapy, which was significantly lower than that of other fracture healed cases(0.8029, p=0.0001). DISCUSSION: Successful fracture healing rate in this conservative therapy was 82%. Eighteen percent of pseudoarthrosis patients with lower EQ-5D could be candidates for the interventional therapy.""",Excluded

The present results refer to cytogenetic assessments in a study cohort of the population of Dolon, a settlement located on the NE boundary of the nuclear weapon test site, which was exposed to elevated doses of ionising radiation primarily due to the first Soviet nuclear test in 1949. Conventional cytogenetic analyses were carried out on 21 blood samples from individuals (more than 50 years old) living in Dolon since the very beginning of nuclear testing. A matched control group included 20 individuals living in non-contaminated areas. Higher frequencies of chromosome aberrations were found in the Dolon cohort compared to the control group, even though they remain within the range of the background levels reported for large normal human population studies on elderly individuals.",Included
3230,"A mouse radiation-induced liver disease model for stereotactic body radiation therapy validated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma PURPOSE: Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses that result in radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) as well as to determine dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice; these parameters are still undefined in HCC SBRT., METHODS: This study consisted of two phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy-based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. The pathological differences, signs [such as mouse performance status (MPS)], and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of the OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in humans, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiotherapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in a mouse study., RESULTS: The evaluation criteria of the mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs were as follows: MPS >= 2.0 +/- 0.52, AST/ALT >= 589.2 +/- 118.5/137.4 +/- 15.3 U/L, serum albumin <= 16.8 +/- 2.29 g/L. The preliminary dose constraints of the OARs were also obtained, such as those for the liver (average dose <= 26.36 +/- 1.71 Gy) and gastrointestinal tract (maximum dose <= 22.63 Gy). Mouse RILD models were able to be developed when the livers were irradiated with average doses of >=31.76 +/- 1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice have also been validated in HCC patients., CONCLUSIONS: Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for the OARs and evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs, and the authors' results favor the study of further approaches to treat HCC with SBRT.",Included
1764,"Magnetic resonance imaging-based tumour perfusion parameters are biomarkers predicting response after radiation to brain metastases PURPOSE: To investigate whether early relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and permeability (Ktrans(2)) measurements may serve as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of radiation response or progression for brain metastases., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy brain metastases in 44 patients treated with either stereotactic radiosurgery or whole brain radiotherapy were imaged with dynamic susceptibility and dynamic contrast enhancement MRI at baseline, 1 week and 1 month after treatment. The final response status was determined according to volume criteria derived from a 1 year post-treatment MRI or last available follow-up MRI. Tumours were characterised as responders, non-responders, progressors and non-progressors and compared for Ktrans(2), rCBF and rCBV differences. Uni- and multivariate analysis evaluated factors associated with tumour response and progression at 1 week and 1 month. A generalised estimating equations (GEE) model accounted for multiple tumours per subject. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis identified optimal cut-off values, sensitivity and specificity for response or progression., RESULTS: Tumour responders showed lower Ktrans(2) and reduced rCBF at 1 week (P < 0.05 each). Progressive disease showed lower rCBF and reduced rCBV at 1 month (P < 0.05 each). GEE and multivariate analysis revealed lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week, an absence of prior radiation predicted response. At 1 month only lower rCBV predicted progressive disease on GEE and multivariate analysis. Optimal cut-off points for Ktrans(2) and rCBV were 1.37 and 2.03 with sensitivity and specificity of 61.5 and 81.1% and 73.9 and 81.8%, respectively., CONCLUSION: Lower Ktrans(2) at 1 week and rCBV at 1 month discriminated responders and progressive disease, respectively.

2211,"Phase II trial of concurrent sunitinib and image-guided radiotherapy for oligometastases Background: Preclinical data suggest that sunitinib enhances the efficacy of radiotherapy. We tested the combination of sunitinib and hypofractionated image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) in a cohort of patients with historically incurable distant metastases. Method(s): Twenty five patients with oligometastases, defined as 1-5 sites of active disease on whole body imaging, were enrolled in a phase II trial from 2/08 to 9/10. The most common tumor types treated were head and neck, liver, lung, kidney and prostate cancers. Patients were treated with the recommended phase II dose of 37.5 mg daily sunitinib (days 1-28) and IGRT 50 Gy (days 8-12 and 15-19). Maintenance sunitinib was used in 33% of patients. Median follow up was 17.5 months (range, 0.7 to 37.4 months). Result(s): The 18-month local control, distant control, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75%, 52%, 56% and 71%, respectively. At last follow-up, 11 (44%) patients were alive without evidence of disease, 7 (28%) were alive with distant metastases, 3 (12%) were dead from distant metastases, 3 (12%) were dead from comorbid illness, and 1 (4%) was dead from treatment-related toxicities. The incidence of acute grade >= 3 toxicities was 28%, most commonly myelosuppression, bleeding and abnormal liver function tests.

1476,"Mortality and cancer incidence following occupational radiation exposure: third analysis of the National Registry for Radiation Workers Mortality and cancer incidence were studied in the National Registry for Radiation Workers in, relative to earlier analyses, an enlarged cohort of 174 541 persons, with longer follow-up (to 2001) and, for the first time, cancer registration data. SMRs for all causes and all malignant neoplasms were 81 and 84 respectively, demonstrating a 'healthy worker effect'. Within the cohort, mortality and incidence from both leukaemia excluding CLL and the grouping of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia increased to a statistically significant extent with increasing radiation dose. Estimates of the trend in risk with dose were similar to those for the Japanese A-bomb survivors, with 90% confidence intervals that excluded both risks more than 2-3 times greater than the A-bomb values and no raised risk. Some evidence of an increasing trend with dose in mortality from all circulatory diseases may, at least partly, be due to confounding by smoking. This analysis provides the most precise estimates to date of mortality and cancer risks following occupational radiation exposure and strengthens the evidence for raised risks from these exposures. The cancer risk estimates are consistent with values used to set radiation protection standards.",Included
327,"Radiation risks to lymphoma patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies Background: To investigate radiation risks to patients undergoing 18F-FDG studies that take into account patient age, sex, and weight. Method(s): We obtained patient demographics and weights of 54 consecutive patients with lymphoma who each underwent a18F-FDG PET study. The administered activity was converted into an effective dose using the patient size dependent dosimetry data provided in ICRP Publication 80. Patient effective doses were converted into estimates of the lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence and cancer mortality using age and sex dependent risk factors provided in BEIR VII. Result(s): The average patient age/weight in this study was 43 years/68 kg for males and 33 years/61 kg for females. Patient effective dose are proportional to patient weight(-0.784) (r2 >0.99). The average administered activity was 410 MBq, which resulted in an average effective dose of 8.5 mSv for males and 8.9 mSv for females. The average cancer incidence was 0.71/1,000 cases for males, and 1.27/1,000 cases for females, with cancer mortality being about half the incidence. Cancer rates for the youngest patients were an order of magnitude higher than those for the oldest patients.

1350,"A multicenter study comparing the outcome of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation between cryoballoon and radiofrequency ablation in patients with heart failure (CRABL-HF): Study design Background: Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasingly performed worldwide in patients with heart failure (HF). However, it has been recently emphasized that AF ablation in patients with HF is associated with increased risks of procedure-related complications and mortality. There are little data about the differences in the efficacy and safety between cryoballoon (CB) and radiofrequency (RF) ablation of AF in patients with HF. Method(s): The CRABL-HF study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, open-label, controlled, and randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety of AF ablation between CB and RF ablation in patients with HF (LVEF <=40%) (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000032433). The CRABL-HF study will consist of 110 patients at multicenter in Japan. The patients will be registered and randomly assigned to either the CB ablation or RF ablation group with a 1:1 allocation. The primary endpoint of this study is the occurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATs) at 1 year with a blanking period of 90 days after ablation. Key secondary endpoints are the success rate of the pulmonary vein isolation, total procedural time, left atrial dwelling time, total fluoroscopy time, radiation exposure, complication rate, composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, change in left ventricular ejection fraction, and change in quality of life. Result(s): The results of this study are currently under investigation.

2547,"Estimates of Environmental Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields and Risk of Lymphoma Subtypes We investigated the association between environmental exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and risk of lymphoma subtypes in a case-control study comprised of 322 patients and 444 individuals serving as controls in Sardinia, Italy in 1998-2004. Questionnaire information included the self-reported distance of the three longest held residential addresses from fixed radio-television transmitters and mobile phone base stations. We georeferenced the residential addresses of all study subjects and obtained the spatial coordinates of mobile phone base stations. For each address within a 500-meter radius from a mobile phone base station, we estimated the RF-EMF intensity using predictions from spatial models, and we performed RF-EMF measurements at the door in the subset of the longest held addresses within a 250-meter radius. We calculated risk of lymphoma and its major subtypes associated with the RF-EMF exposure metrics with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting by age, gender and years of education. In the analysis of self-reported data, risk associated with residence in proximity (within 50 meters) to fixed radio-television transmitters was likewise elevated for lymphoma overall [odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.6], and for the major lymphoma subtypes. With reference to mobile phone base stations, we did not observe an association with either the self-reported, or the geocoded distance from mobile phone base stations. RF-EMF measurements did not vary by case-control status. By comparing the self-reports to the geocoded data, we discovered that the cases tended to underestimate the distance from mobile phone base stations differentially from the controls (P = 0.073). The interpretation of our findings is compromised by the limited study size, particularly in the analysis of the individual lymphoma subtypes, and the unavailability of the spatial coordinates of radio-television transmitters. Nonetheless, our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between environmental exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations and risk of lymphoma subtypes.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
3420,"Thyroid nodules in the population living around semipalatinsk nuclear test site: Possible implications for dose-response relationships study The risk of radiation-induced nodules is higher than the risk for radiation-induced cancer. Risk factors and specific modifiers of the dose-response relationship may vary among different populations and not be well recognized. Many thyroid studies have considered thyroid nodularity itself, but not specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. There are many specific types of thyroid nodules which follow a morphological classification of thyroid lesions, including some congenital and tumor-like conditions. Modern equipment and technique can help us to identify particular specific types of thyroid nodules. In this study we report some results of a clinically applicable approach to materials derived from three studies. From 1999 through 2002, we have screened 571 current residents from 4 exposed and 1 control village near the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site area, who were of similar ages (<20) at the time of major radiation fallout events at the SNTS. Prevalent nodules were identified by ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, cytopathology results. Analysis of ultrasound images and cytopathology of thyroid lesions among exposed and non-exposed population allowed us to distinguish some interesting ultrasound features for specific types of thyroid nodules. We believe that it would be interesting and possibly more informative for thyroid dosimetry studies to consider specific morphological types of thyroid nodules. We need more detailed research to clarify the feasibility of applying these findings for study of the dose-response relationship.",Included
1482,"Mechanism of low-level microwave radiation effect on nervous system The aim of this study is to explain the mechanism of the effect of low-level modulated microwave radiation on brain bioelectrical oscillations. The proposed model of excitation by low-level microwave radiation bases on the influence of water polarization on hydrogen bonding forces between water molecules, caused by this the enhancement of diffusion and consequences on neurotransmitters transit time and neuron resting potential. Modulated microwave radiation causes periodic alteration of the neurophysiologic parameters and parametric excitation of brain bioelectric oscillations. The experiments to detect logical outcome of the mechanism on physiological level were carried out on 15 human volunteers. The 450-MHz microwave radiation modulated at 7, 40 and 1000 Hz frequencies was applied at the field power density of 0.16 mW/cm2. A relative change in the EEG power with and without radiation during 10 cycles was used as a quantitative measure. Experimental data demonstrated that modulated at 40 Hz microwave radiation enhanced EEG power in EEG alpha and beta frequency bands. No significant alterations were detected at 7 and 1000 Hz modulation frequencies. These results are in good agreement with the theory of parametric excitation of the brain bioelectric oscillations caused by the periodic alteration of neurophysiologic parameters and support the proposed mechanism. The proposed theoretical framework has been shown to predict the results of experimental study. The suggested mechanism, free of the restrictions related to field strength or time constant, is the first one providing explanation of low-level microwave radiation effects.",Excluded

Method(s): Patients with HCCCL treated with C-ion RT at our hospital between January 2011 and December 2018 were evaluated. The total dose was 52.8 or 60 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) in four or 12 fractions depending on the distance between the tumor and the gastrointestinal tract. The survival outcome, the presence or absence of recurrence (local recurrence, intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field, or extrahepatic recurrence), and acute/late adverse events were evaluated. Result(s): Nine patients were included. The median tumor size was 3.4 cm, and the median follow-up duration was 18.3 months for all patients. No patient developed local recurrence during follow-up. Five patients subsequently developed intrahepatic recurrence outside the irradiation field and two had extrahepatic metastasis. Five patients died of hepatocellular carcinoma. No acute adverse events of grade >=2 were observed. Two patients experienced grade 2 or 3 late adverse events, including obstructive jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, and edema.

After a burr hole trephination in the rat skull, the cerebral hemisphere was exposed to a single 10 Gy dose of gamma rays, and the radiation effect was assessed at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after irradiation. Histological changes, such as reactive gliosis, inflammation, vascular proliferation and necrosis, were correlated with the duration after irradiation. Significant VEGF and FGF2 expression in the 2- and 8-week were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification in the radiation group. Immunohistochemical study for VEGF was done and the number of positive cells gradually increased over time, compared with the sham operation group. In conclusion, the radiation injuries consisted of radiation necrosis associated with the expression of VEGF and FGF2. These findings indicate that VEGF and FGF2 may play a role in the radiation injuries after intraoperative single high-dose irradiation.",Included

2283,"Radiosurgery with flattening-filter-free techniques in the treatment of brain metastases : Plan comparison and early clinical evaluation BACKGROUND: Radiosurgical treatment of brain metastases is well established in daily clinical routine. Utilization of flattening-filter-free beams (FFF) may allow for more rapid delivery of treatment doses and improve clinical comfort. Hence, we compared plan quality and efficiency of radiosurgery in FFF mode to FF techniques., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between November 2014 and June 2015, 21 consecutive patients with 25 brain metastases were treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in FFF mode. Brain metastases received dose-fractionation schedules of 1 x 20 Gy or 1 x 18 Gy, delivered to the conformally enclosing 80 % isodose. Three patients with critically localized or large (>3 cm) brain metastases were treated with 6 x 5 Gy. Plan quality and efficiency were evaluated by analyzing conformity, dose gradients, dose to healthy brain tissue, treatment delivery time, and number of monitor units. FFF plans were compared to those using the FF method, and early clinical outcome and toxicity were assessed., RESULTS: FFF mode resulted in significant reductions in beam-on time (p < 0.001) and mean brain dose (p = 0.001) relative to FF-mode comparison plans. Furthermore, significant improvements in dose gradients and sharper dose falloffs were found for SRS in FFF mode (-1.1 %, -29.6 %; p <= 0.003), but conformity was slightly superior in SRS in FF mode (-1.3 %; p = 0.001). With a median follow-up time of 5.1 months, 6-month overall survival was 63.3 %. Local control was observed in 24 of 25 brain metastases (96 %)., CONCLUSION: SRS in FFF mode is time efficient and provides similar plan quality with the opportunity of slightly reduced dose exposure to healthy brain tissue when compared to SRS in FF mode. Clinical outcomes appear promising and show only modest treatment-related toxicity.",Excluded

The sample analyzed at present represents approximately 30% of the intended future trial size., METHODS: The patients were randomly assigned to receive 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 7 days a week (n = 44) or 63 Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions 5 days a week with concurrent cisplatin 80-100 mg per square metre of body surface area on Days 1, 22 and 43 of the course of radiotherapy (n = 40). Acute mucosal reactions were scored using the modified Dische system., RESULTS: 15 (17.9%) patients, including 5 patients in p-CAIR and 10 patients in p-RTCT, did not comply with the assigned radiation treatment, mostly because of rapid tumour progression or deteriorating general performance. In p-RTCT, 22 (55%) patients received less than the intended three courses of chemotherapy mostly owing to haematological toxicity. The average maximum mucosal severity score was 14.2 in p-CAIR compared with 13.4 in p-RTCT; the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31)., CONCLUSION: The schedules compared (p-CAIR and p-RTCT) did not differ considerably with respect to acute mucosal reactions. Haematological toxicity in p-RTCT was elevated compared with p-CAIR. Both schedules were considered tolerable with respect to acute toxicity, which justifies further recruitment to the trial., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The results show that early mucosal reactions are comparable in both trial arms but haematological toxicity is more pronounced during radiochemotherapy.",Excluded
2088,"Salivary anionic changes after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A 1-year prospective study Objectives: To investigate the salivary anionic changes of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated by radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-eight patients with T1-4, N0-2, M0 NPC received conventional radiotherapy. Stimulated whole saliva was collected at baseline and 2, 6 and 12 months after radiotherapy. Salivary anions levels were measured using ion chromatography. Result(s): A reduction in stimulated saliva flow and salivary pH was accompanied by sustained changes in anionic composition. At 2 months following radiotherapy, there was a significant increase in chloride, sulphate, lactate and formate levels while significant reductions in nitrate and thiocyanate levels were found. No further changes in these anion levels were observed at 6 and 12 months. No significant changes were found in phosphate, acetate, or propionate levels throughout the study period. Conclusion(s): Conventional radiotherapy has a significant and prolonged impact on certain anionic species, likely contributing to increased cariogenic properties and reduced antimicrobial capacities of saliva in NPC patients post-radiotherapy.Copyright © 2016 Pow et al.

North Central Cancer Treatment Group Per protocol, patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an intergroup phase II trial conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group had their cognitive functions measured using the Folstein and Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) and their physical functions measured using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Score (PS) at study entry, at each treatment evaluation, and at quarterly intervals thereafter until disease progression or death. Of the 53 eligible participants who began therapy, 46 (87%) had baseline MMSE scores recorded, 36 (68%) had at least one follow-up MMSE, and 32 (60%) had both, while 52 (98%) had baseline PS, 49 (92%) had at least one follow-up PS, and 48 (91%) had both. Patterns of MMSE and PS values over time were studied in each individual, in the group as a whole, in the 20 patients who completed the study regimen, in the 23 who survived more than a year, and in patients who were classified as nonprogressors at each key evaluation. For each patient, all recorded values were plotted versus time, with dates of disease progression and death included, to look for signs of decline in cognitive or physical function preceding adverse events. Long-term declines in scores of both cognitive and physical function were observed in many treated patients with primary CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Nearly all patients who were alive more than 52 weeks after study entry had a demonstrable decline in cognitive and physical functionality. Such declines may occur before disease progression is documented; they may also occur in some patients who have long-term follow-up without evidence of disease progression. Declining MMSE and PS was a poor predictor of disease progression. There was no association of PS and toxicity. The data from this study demonstrated the considerable difficulties we encountered conducting an ancillary study such as this within a multicenter clinical trial. Firstly, the test instruments written into the protocol were unable to tell if the declines seen were due to disease, treatment, co-morbidity, or other factors. Secondly, the missing data created difficulties in interpreting outcome.",Excluded
648,"The effect of oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid and high-dose proton pump inhibitors on the histology of Barrett's esophagus Bile acids may play a role in the pathogenesis of Barrett's esophagus (BE). Bile composition can be influenced by oral administration of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). We prospectively investigated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) supplemented with UDCA in vivo in patients with BE. Patients with no or low-grade dysplasia who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI were eligible for the study. In order to exclude the effects of acid reflux, all patients were initially treated with 40 mg esomeprazole (ESO) twice daily for 6 months and continued on this dose till the end of the study (t = 12 months). During a period of 6 months (t = 6 month - t = 12 month) patients were treated with oral UDCA (600 mg twice daily). Patients underwent endoscopy at t = 0 months, t = 6 months and t = 12 months with multiple biopsies of the distal and proximal BE segment, normal squamous and gastric cardia. In addition, pH was measured at t = 0 months and t = 6 months using a BRAVO wireless pH capsule. Bile was sampled at the beginning of the UDCA treatment and 6 months later (t = 6 month and t = 12 month). All biopsies were reviewed for the extent of metaplasia, dysplasia, and acute and chronic inflammation. In addition, proliferation (Ki67), differentiation (villin, cytokeratins 7 and 20) and inflammation (COX-2) were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Nine patients (mean age 60 years, median BE length 7 cm) were included, of whom six had no dysplasia and three had low-grade dysplasia. pH measurements revealed a normal acid exposure in most patients at t = 0 and t = 6 months. In addition, bile composition analysis demonstrated the efficacy of UDCA. Combining the results of both phases of the study, no significant changes were seen in any of the histological or IHC parameters. Differentiation and proliferation parameters showed no significant changes. In this study, in BE patients who were clinically asymptomatic on PPI, increasing the PPI dose to the maximum for 6 months followed by the addition of UDCA for 6 months did not result in significant histological or IHC changes in their BE.",Excluded

The overall survival rates for 3, 5, and 10 years were 73.8%, 58.6% and 39.4%, respectively. 2) Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, N stage, skull base invasion, cranial nerve invasion, nasal cavity invasion, cervical node metastasis, unilateral/bilateral neck node metastasis, cervical node metastasis position, intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx, external beam radiotherapy method and chemotherapy were significantly associated with the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival, and overall survival (P<0.05). The irradiation dose of nasopharynx was significantly associated with the nasopharynx control rate and overall survival (P<0.05). The tumor-free survival of the patients with carotid sheath involvement was lower than that of the patients without carotid sheath involvement (P<0.05). 3) Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that gender, age, clinical stage, T stage, unilateral/bilateral cervical node metastasis, and intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx were independent influential factors of the control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival. 4) The stratified analysis showed that T2 and T3 patients who received adjuvant high dose intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx presented with a higher control rate of nasopharynx, tumor-free survival and overall survival (P<0.05). Conclusion(s): Male NPC patients with advanced clinical stage (especially T stage) and bilateral cervical node metastasis have a poorer prognosis. Adjuvant intracavity brachytherapy of nasopharynx can improve the prognosis of T2 and T3 patients.",Excluded
2157,"Late effects of radiation therapy in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease In the last two decades, a considerable amount of clinical and experimental animal data has been accumulated regarding the tolerance of the major normal tissues and organs traversed by the radiation beams in treating Hodgkin's disease. Typically, the tolerance of several tissues and organs must be considered in designing the very large radiation portals such as the mantle. Today, sophisticated machinery such as computerized tomography scanners, simulators, computers, and linear accelerators are available to improve the radiation planning and treatment of Hodgkin's disease. In this paper, we discuss the late effects of radiation therapy to the lung, heart, thyroid, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and the gonads of adults with Hodgkin's disease. Emphasis is placed on our recommendations for modifications of radiation technique to improve the complication-free cure rate.",Excluded
3044,"Radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro Exposure to low doses of radiation and/or chemicals can prime an organism to withstand the stress of a subsequent exposure to higher doses of the same agent. In the case of radiation, this phenomenon has been called radioadaptive response. Cytogenetic studies have been undertaken in human lymphocytes to investigate adaptive response (AR) to ionizing radiation, in particular to seek the role of variables such as priming dose, cell cycle stage, and age and gender of the donor. We demonstrated that pre-exposure of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures to very low doses in the range of about 1 cGy (priming or adaptive dose [AD]) reduced the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells induced by 100 cGy - that is, produced an AR in these cells in vitro. However, pre-exposure of cells to 10.0 cGy did not reduce the chromosomal damage (micronuclei) induced by the challenging dose (CD) of 100 cGy under the same protocol, thus exhibiting an inverse dose-response relationship. There was marked variability in the AR among the individuals investigated in the study. The extent of AR also depended on the stage of cell cycle exposed to the CD of radiation. Maximum AR was observed when CD of 100 cGy was given 4 hours after AD, 30 hours following the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes. The least AR was observed when CD was given 48 hours after stimulation. Interestingly, AR was also found to be dependent on the age of the donor, a decrease in AR being observed with an increasing age. No significant difference in AR was observed between male and female donors. To understand the molecular events underlying AR, protein synthesis patterns were studied in human lymphocytes subjected to mitogen, heat, or radiation stress. Heat shock (45 degreeC, for 15 min) induced 7 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 40 to 80 kDa, while treatment with phytohemagglutinin (40 mug/ mL) showed induction of 2 proteins of molecular weights 38 and 48 kDa, respectively. However, exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to gamma radiation did not significantly induce synthesis of any protein, up to 800 cGy dose. Lack of induction of proteins by gamma radiation in human lymphocytes contrasts with the previous reports showing X-ray radiation-enhanced gene expression in melanoma cells and/or human tumor fibroblasts.",Included
2493,"Effect of different reconstruction algorithms on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) performance in ultra-low dose CT colonography PURPOSE: To assess the effect of different reconstruction algorithms on computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) performance in ultra-low-dose CT colonography (ULD CTC)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: IRB approval and informed consents were obtained. Thirty prospectively enrolled patients underwent non-contrast CTC at 120 kVp/10 mAs in supine and 100 kVp/10 mAs in prone positions, followed by same-day colonoscopy. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), 80% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR80), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). A commercial CAD system was applied and per-polyp sensitivities and numbers of false-positives (FPs) were compared among algorithms., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose of CTC was 1.02 mSv. Of 101 polyps detected and removed by colonoscopy, 61 polyps were detected on supine and on prone CTC datasets on consensus unblinded review, resulting in 122 visible polyps (32 polyps<6 mm, 52 6-9.9 mm, and 38>=10 mm). Per-polyp sensitivity of CAD for all polyps was highest with MBIR (56/122, 45.9%), followed by ASIR80 (54/122, 44.3%) and FBP (43/122, 35.2%), with significant differences between FBP and IR algorithms (P<0.017). Per-polyp sensitivity for polyps>=10 mm was also higher with MBIR (25/38, 65.8%) and ASIR80 (24/38, 63.2%) than with FBP (20/38, 58.8%), albeit without statistical significance (P>0.017). Mean number of FPs was significantly different among algorithms (FBP, 1.4; ASIR, 2.1; MBIR, 2.4) (P=0.011)., CONCLUSION: Although the performance of stand-alone CAD for ULD CTC can be improved, IR algorithms, particularly MBIR, were shown to significantly increase the per-polyp sensitivity of CAD compared to FBP according to this study. Therefore, as ULD CTC only requires 1.02mSv, specific optimization of CAD for ULD CTC and IR algorithms is strongly warranted to make ULD CTC with CAD clinically viable.

645,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

2153,"Protein expression of nucleophosmin, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 correlates with human nasopharyngeal carcinoma radioresistance in vivo Radioresistance is a significant obstacle in the treatment of endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The present study aimed to identify proteins associated with radioresistance in NPC in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics analyses were conducted to screen for differentially-expressed proteins (DEPs) in parental CNE-2 cells and CNE-2R cells. Using proteomics approaches, 16 DEPs were identified. Of these DEPs, nucleophosmin (NPM1), annexin A3 and nm23-H1, were verified using western blot analyses. The tumorigenicity was investigated using mouse xenograft tumorigenicity assays, and tumor growth curves were generated. The protein expression of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 was examined by immunohistochemically staining tumor tissues. NPM1 and annexin A3 protein levels were downregulated in the CNE-2R cells, whereas nm23-H1 expression was upregulated. In vivo tests showed that compared with the CNE-2 tumors, CNE-2R tumor growth was significantly retarded (P<0.05). CNE-2 tumor progression was inhibited by irradiation, but CNE-2R tumor progression was not, indicating that the CNE-2R cells were also radioresistant in vivo. NPM1 and annexin A3 expression was significantly lower in non-irradiated (NIR)-CNE-2R tumors compared with NIR-CNE-2 tumors (P<0.01). However, Nm23-H1 protein levels were significantly higher (P<0.05). Overall, the present study established comparable radioresistant and radiosensitive tumor models of human NPC, and identified candidate biomarkers that may correlate with radioresistance. The data showed that dysregulation of NPM1, annexin A3 and nm23-H1 expression correlated with the cellular and tumor radioresponse. These proteins are involved in the regulation of intracellular functions, including stress responses, cell proliferation and DNA repair. However, further clinical evaluations are required.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Included
3294,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded
2601,"Image quality in obese patients undergoing 256-row computed tomography coronary angiography To evaluate, objectively and subjectively, the feasibility of 256-row computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in obese patients. 256-row CTCA was performed in 68 symptomatic patients (age 61 +/- 10 years, 37 females), 39 obese (body mass index-BMI > 30 kg/m(2)) and 29 non-obese. Retrospective analysis was performed by two observers who assessed the image quality of each coronary segment using a 4-point subjective scale (1 excellent to 4 non-diagnostic), and another blinded observer measured objective image parameters. BMI in the obese group was 35 +/- 5 (32-65) Kg/m(2), and 24 +/- 3 (16-29) Kg/m(2) in the non-obese (P = 0.004). Average subjective image quality was similar in obese (1.41 +/- 0.40) and non-obese (1.34 +/- 0.40) patients, P = 0.17. Proportion of coronary artery segments with non-diagnostic image quality was low in both groups (0.7% in obese and 0.2% in non-obese, P = 0.31).

Methods and Materials: Radiotherapy was delivered to a total of 45 Gy in 25 fractions and followed by a coned-down boost of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of a fixed dose of oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2/week) on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29 and escalated doses of S-1 on Days 1-14 and 22-35. The initial dose of S-1 was 50 mg/m2/day, gradually increasing to 60, 70, and 80 mg/m2/day. Surgery was performed within 6 +/- 2 weeks. Result(s): Twelve patients were enrolled and tolerated up to Dose Level 4 (3 patients at each dose level) without dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 3 patients were enrolled at Dose Level 4, with 1 experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity of Grade 3 diarrhea. Although maximum tolerated dose was not attained, Dose Level 4 (S-1 80 mg/m 2/day) was chosen as the recommended dose for further Phase II studies. No Grade 4 toxicity was observed, and Grade 3 toxicities of leukopenia and diarrhea occurred in the same patient (1 of 15, 6.7%). Pathologic complete responses were observed in 2 of 15 patients (13.3%).

1335,"Low-dose radiation exposure and protection against atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice: the influence of P53 heterozygosity We recently described the effects of low-dose gamma-radiation exposures on atherosclerosis in genetically susceptible (ApoE(-/-)) mice with normal p53 function. Doses as low as 25 mGy, given at either early or late stage disease, generally protected against atherosclerosis in a manner distinctly nonlinear with dose. We now report the influence of low doses (25-500 mGy) on atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice with reduced p53 function (Trp53(+/-)). Single exposures were given at either low or high dose rate (1 or 150 mGy/min) to female C57BL/6J ApoE(-/-) Trp53(+/-) mice. Mice were exposed at either early stage disease (2 months of age) and examined 3 or 6 months later, or at late stage disease (7 months of age) and examined 2 or 4 months later. In unirradiated mice, reduced p53 functionality elevated serum cholesterol and accelerated both aortic root lesion growth and severity in young mice. Radiation exposure to doses as low as 25 mGy at early stage disease, at either the high or the low dose rate, inhibited lesion growth, decreased lesion frequency and slowed the progression of lesion severity in the aortic root. In contrast, exposure at late stage disease produced generally detrimental effects. Both low-and high-dose-rate exposures accelerated lesion growth and high dose rate exposures also increased serum cholesterol levels. These results show that at early stage disease, reduced p53 function does not influence the protective effects against atherosclerosis of low doses given at low dose rate. In contrast, when exposed to the same doses at late stage disease, reduced p53 function produced detrimental effects, rather than the protective effects seen in Trp53 normal mice. As in the Trp53 normal mice, all effects were highly nonlinear with dose. These results indicate that variations in p53 functionality can dramatically alter the outcome of a low-dose exposure, and that the assumption of a linear response with dose for human populations is probably unwarranted.",Excluded
69,"Changes in boundary extension effect during spatial confinement Changes in perception during space missions are usually attributed to microgravity. However, additional factors, such as spatial confinement, may contribute to changes in perception. We tested changes in scene perception using a boundary extension (BE) paradigm during a 105-day Earth-based space-simulation study. In addition to the close-up/wide-angle views used in BE, we presented two types of scenes based on the distance from the observer (proximal/distant scenes). In crew members (n = 6), we found that BE partly increased over time, but the size of BE error did not change in the control group (n = 22). We propose that this effect is caused by an increasing BE effect in stimuli that depict distant scenes and is related to spatial confinement. The results might be important for other situations of spatial confinement with restricted visual depth (e.g., submarine crew, patients confined to a bed). Generally, we found a larger BE effect in proximal scenes compared with the distant scenes. We also demonstrated that with no feedback, subjects preserve the level of the BE effect during repeated measurements. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.",Excluded

We performed a retrospective analysis of 151 patients older than 65 years with GBM treated in 3 Lombardia Hospitals. In univariate regression analysis higher KPS (p = 0.02), macroscopical total resection (p < 0.003), radiotherapy (p < 0.0001), chemotherapy (p < 0.0001) and second line chemotheraphy (p = 0.02) were of positive prognostic value. On the contrary older age (> 70 years), presence of seizure at onset and additional resection after tumor recurrence did not influence OS. Multivariate analysis revealed radiotherapy (HR 0.2 p < 0.0001) and extent of surgery (HR 0.3, p = 0,0063) as positive independent prognostic factors. Patients receiving radio-chemiotherapy displayed more treatment-related toxicities with a slightly prolonged OS versus those receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy. With the limits of a retrospective study, our data suggest that in elderly fit patients extensive surgery should be considered, moreover adjuvant treatments led to an increase in OS. Randomized controlled study are needed to develop treatment guidelines for elderly GBM patients and to assess whether the combination of post-surgical radio and chemiotherapy may be superior to hypofractionated radiotherapy and chemiotherapy in fit patients.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

3210,"Survival Impact of Cardiac Dose Following Lung Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Heart dose has been emerging as a strong predictor of outcomes in radiation therapy treatment for lung cancer. It is necessary to determine the impact of dose to substructures of the heart on overall survival. Heart substructures were contoured retrospectively on 189 patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy. Clinical variables and the dose to these structures were correlated with non-cancer-related deaths. Higher bilateral ventricles max dose is associated with poorer survival. Heart dose parameters should be considered when planning patients for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of radiation dose to substructures of the heart in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients on non-cancer-related deaths. Method(s): Patients treated with lung SBRT at a single institution from 2005 to 2013 were included. The heart and its substructures were contoured, and dose was calculated including mean, max, and max 10 cc dose. Clinical variables including stage, histology, age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), preexisting cardiac disease, pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second, diffusion capacity), and smoking status were explored for association with non-cancer-related deaths in univariable (UVA) and multivariable (MVA) analyses. Heart dosimetric parameters were correlated with the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) using UVA and MVA. Result(s): A total of 189 patients were included with median age of 76 years (range, 48-93 years). Of these patients, 45.5% were female, 27.5% were T2, 16.9% were current smokers, 64% had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and 34.5% had CCI score of >= 3. Mean lung dose +/- SD was 456 +/- 231 cGy. Heart max, mean, and 10 cc doses were 1867 +/- 1712 cGy, 265 +/- 269 cGy, and 1150 +/- 1075 cGy, respectively. There were 14 (7.4%) >= Grade 2 RP and 3 (1.6%) were >= Grade 3. The median overall survival was 37.3 months (95% confidence interval, 29.8-45.3 months). On UVA, female gender (P <.01), higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (P =.01), cardiac risk (P <.01), CCI (P <.01), and bilateral ventricles max dose (P =.02) were associated with non-cancer-related deaths; on MVA, bilateral ventricles max dose was significant (P =.05).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate image quality and radiation dose when patients with atrial fibrillation undergo coronary CT angiography (CTA) using prospectively ECG-gated 320-MDCT technology with an absolute-delay strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A cohort of 75 consecutive patients (60 men and 15 women; age (+/- SD), 71 +/- 10 years) who underwent prospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA using a 320-MDCT scanner during atrial fibrillation was matched with 75 control patients imaged in sinus rhythm. All coronary CTA for the atrial fibrillation cohort used absolute-delay strategy. Subjective image quality score and the dose-length product (DLP) were compared between the two cohorts and, for the atrial fibrillation cohort, among those patients imaged over a different number of heartbeats. The accuracy of stenosis detection was evaluated in 17 studies of the atrial fibrillation cohort using catheter angiography as a reference standard. RESULTS. For those patients imaged in atrial fibrillation, one- And two-beat acquisitions were performed in 26.7% (n = 20) and 40% (n = 30) of patients, respectively. There was no significant difference in image quality between the atrial fibrillation (2.9 +/- 0.4) and sinus rhythm (2.9 +/- 0.3) cohorts, nor was there a difference in image quality with respect to the number of heartbeats used in the acquisition. The atrial fibrillation cohort had an 80% higher DLP (680 +/- 470 vs 372 +/- 236 mGy x cm, p < 0.0001). The patient-based sensitivity and negative predictive value for stenosis detection were both 100%. CONCLUSION. Using an absolute-delay strategy, two thirds of patients who underwent prospectively ECG-gated coronary CTA using a 320-MDCT scanner were imaged within two heartbeats or fewer. Compared with patients imaged in sinus rhythm, the image quality was comparative and the radiation dose was 1.8-fold higher.",Excluded
2222,"The characteristics of the cerebral asthenia syndrome in persons who were victims of the accident at the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Station A total of 107 patients (81 males, 26 females), their age ranging between 34 to 45 years, diagnosed as having discirculatory encephalopathy with underlying cerebrasthenic syndrome, were examined. All the examinees took part in the elimination of the Chernobyl accident effects in 1986. It was found out, that cerebrasthenia which is present in the structure of all clinical variants of organic affection of the brain is the most mobile (functional) link of the morbid process when a disorder sets in rather than the failure of the organ to perform its function. It ranks among other asthenic syndromes reflecting a specific character of exogenous radiation effect on the organism, being a result of a characteristic interaction between the organism and a health hazard. Measures to dispel the asthenic component at the initial stages of development of the disorder will make for reduction or arrest of progression of organic symptomatology.",Included
821,"Sex- and APOE isoform-dependent effects of radiation on cognitive function Clinical irradiation of the brain induces hippocampus-dependent cognitive impairments in some but not all individuals, suggesting the involvement of genetic risk factors. Deficiency of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is important for the metabolism and redistribution of lipoproteins and cholesterol, increases behavioral impairments after irradiation, supporting a protective role for APOE against radiation-induced cognitive injury. Compared to APOE3, APOE4 increases while APOE2 decreases the risk of developing age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease, particularly in women. To determine the potential effects of APOE isoform and sex on radiation-induced cognitive impairments, we irradiated 2-month-old male and female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 mice and assessed their cognitive performance 3 months later. When hippocampus-dependent spatial learning and memory were assessed in the water maze, sham-irradiated female APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 and irradiated female APOE2 mice showed spatial memory retention, but irradiated female APOE3 and APOE4 mice did not. Compared to sham-irradiated female APOE4 mice, irradiated female APOE4 mice also required more trials to reach criterion in the hippocampus-dependent passive avoidance test. Radiation had no effects on water maze or passive avoidance learning and memory of male APOE2, APOE3 or APOE4 mice, indicating that the effects of radiation on cognitive performance are dependent on sex- and APOE isoform.",Included
621,"Effects of exposure to a mobile phone on sexual behavior in adult male rabbit: an observational study The accumulating effects of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted by a conventional mobile phone (MP) on male sexual behaviour have not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we studied these effects in 18 male rabbits that were randomly divided into phone and control groups. Six female teasers were taken successively to the male's cage and the copulatory behavior was recorded. Serum total testosterone, dopamine and cortisol were evaluated. The animals of the phone group were exposed to MPs (800 MHz) in a standby position for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, the copulatory behavior and hormonal assays were re-evaluated. Mounts without ejaculation were the main mounts in the phone group and its duration and frequency increased significantly compared with the controls, whereas the reverse was observed in its mounts with ejaculation. Ejaculation frequency dropped significantly, biting/grasping against teasers increased notably and mounting latency in accumulated means from the first to the fourth teasers were noted in the phone group. The hormonal assays did not show any significant differences between the study groups. Therefore, the pulsed radiofrequency emitted by a conventional MP, which was kept on a standby position, could affect the sexual behavior in the rabbit.",Excluded
2256,"Defining disease progression in Chinese mainland people: Association between bone mineral density and knee osteoarthritis Objective: To evaluate change in bone mineral density (BMD) during development of knee osteoarthritis (OA) in elderly Chinese community residents. Further, to monitor disease progression by recording speed of sound (SOS), one parameter of BMD provided by quantitative ultrasound measurement. Method(s): A total of 4173 community residents of the Chinese mainland were organized to complete questionnaires and relevant measurements, including anthropometry, radiology and quantitative ultrasound (QUS). SOS measurements of the distal radius were acquired using QUS measurements. The Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of knee OA was evaluated by two experienced radiographers using X-rays. Finally, a general linear models analysis was performed to determine potential relationships. Further, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was applied to assess the distinction model. Result(s): The SOS score in the OA group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.001). However, after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI), no significant difference was observed in the male population (p = 0.841), while a significantly lower SOS score presented in knee OA participants in the female population (p = 0.033). A turning point in SOS scores, from increasing to decreasing trends, occurred around KL grade 2; the SOS score gradually increased with progression in participants from KL grades 0 to 2, whereas the SOS score presented a significant decrease in participants with KL grades 3 and 4. The AUC for the model to distinguish OA progression was 0.891. Conclusion(s): There was a non-linear and stage-specific association between SOS score and knee OA, which presented a positive relationship in early stages, but a negative relationship in advanced stages. A decline of SOS score in knee OA patients in early stages should alert clinicians to the possibility of disease progression. The Translational potential of this article: In the present study, the relationship between OA and BMD had established by SOS. The results suggested that close monitoring of SOS in elderly Chinese communities residents with knee OA could alert disease progression involvement by an easily accessible method, and help early referral to orthopedist consultation for further examination and treatment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s)",Excluded
2574,"Value ofadditional magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging in patients with high calcium score or intermediate stenoses detected by computed tomography coronaryangiography Objectives: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and cardiac magnetic resonance myocardial perfusion imaging (CMR-MPI) are established diagnostic tools for non-invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). While CCTA offers highresolution images of coronary anatomy, CMR-MPI is able to give valuable functional information. Aim of this study was to evaluate the burden of myocardial ischemia in patients with intermediate stenosis assessed by CCTA and in patients, which were not eligible to CTA due to high calciumscore or unfavourable calciumplaque location. Method(s): 102 patients with known CAD (n=15) and suspected CAD (n=87) were included at one centre (CCB). All patients underwent a standardized CCTA protocol and a standardized adenosine stress CMR-MPI study (1.5 T). Intermediate stenoses were defined as>30 and<= 70% luminal narrowing in CCTA. Both, CCTA and CMR-MPI were analysed by highly experienced readers (radiologist and/or cardiologist). Result(s): Mean Agatston coronary artery calcium score (CAC) was 970 +/- 881. In 47 patients (46%) no CTA was performed due to the high CAC or an unfavourable plaque location. In the remaining patients CCTA affirmed at least one intermediate stenosis with unknown relevance regarding myocardial ischemia. CMR-MPI revealed a visual assessed ischemia in 27 (26.5%). In summary 34 patients (33%) were referred to coronary angiography (XA) due to CMR results and clinical decision; +/- patients denied XA. In 21 of the remaining 28 patients significant CAD was diagnosed. In patients with ischemia in CMR, XA confirmed significant CAD (89.5%) in 17 patients, in 2 patients significant CAD was excluded. In both patients no CCTA was done due to high CAC. Of the remaining patients, which underwent XA; only 4 had relevant CAD (36.4%). Overall, the stepwise approach of imaging modalities would help to reduce the costs by around 9% in contrast to an alternative invasive strategy XA with fractional flow reserve (FFR)measurement. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate that CMR-MPRI is a highly valuable tool to evaluate patients at risk for myocardial ischemia with unclear CCTA results and can avoid radiation exposure and reduce cost efforts.",Excluded
2730,"Radon testing in rapid access lung clinics: an opportunity for secondary prevention Background: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and a level 1 carcinogen. It acts synergistically with cigarette smoke to cause lung cancer. In Ireland, radon is estimated to be associated with 13 % of all lung cancers. Rapid access lung cancer clinics (RALC's) were established in the UK and Ireland to improve lung cancer management outcomes. There has been no attempt to date to provide advice on household radon exposure assessments in this setting. Aim(s): We performed a prospective feasibility study of radon assessment in our RALC to test the hypothesis that patients would avail of this service and that it would provide an opportunity for secondary prevention in at risk persons. Method(s): We investigated household radon levels in consecutive patients who were newly referred with symptoms of lung cancer to the RALC in Galway University Hospital, Ireland over a 6-month period. Result(s): Of 50 patients enrolled, 42 returned valid results. Overall 21 % of patients had radon levels recorded above the national reference level. Only 5 % of patients were aware of the association between radon gas and lung cancer. Smokers were significantly less likely to engage fully in radon testing. Conclusion(s): The development of RALC's offers a novel opportunity to integrate the concepts of radon exposure, cigarette smoking and the development of lung cancer, and to reinforce this message in the minds of at risk patients.Copyright © 2016, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",Excluded

Most of these tissues were radioprotected, and the degree of radioprotection depended on the dose of WR-2721 and the time interval between administration of WR-2721 and radiation treatment. WR-2721 increased resistance of jejunal epithelial cells and spermatogenic cells to single doses of gamma-rays by factors of 1.64 and 1.54, respectively. Protection against hair loss was less pronounced; the dose-modifying factor here was 1.24. The radiation-induced acute damage of the lung expressed by the increased formation of tumor nodules in the lung was not decreased by treatment of animals with WR-2721 before radiation. In contrast, WR-2721 augmented the radiation-induced enhancement of metastasis formation in the lung. WR-2721 protected fibrosarcoma micrometastases in the lung against therapeutic effect of radiation by a factor of 1.238.

2979,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry Background: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk. Case Description: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy). Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

Method(s): We quantitatively analyzed 21 plans made by 11 clinicians in seven CyberKnife centers. The clinicians were provided with a raw data set (pituitary adenoma and meningioma) including clinical information, and were asked to delineate the lesions and create a treatment plan. Their contouring and plans (10 adenoma and 11 meningioma plans), were then compared. In addition, we estimated the influence of differences in contouring by superimposing the respective contours onto a default plan. Result(s): The median planning target volume (PTV) and the ratio of the largest to the smallest contoured volume were 9.22 cm3 (range, 7.17 - 14.3 cm3) and 1.99 for pituitary adenoma, and 6.86 cm3 (range 6.05 - 14.6 cm3) and 2.41 for meningioma. PTV volume was 10.1 +/- 1.74 cm3 for group 1 with a margin of 1 -2 mm around the CTV (n = 3) and 9.28 +/- 1.8 cm3(p = 0.51) for group 2 with no margin (n = 7) in pituitary adenoma. In meningioma, group 1 showed larger PTV volume (10.1 +/- 3.26 cm3) than group 2 (6.91 +/- 0.7 cm3, p = 0.03). All submitted plan keep the irradiated dose to optic tract within the range of 50 Gy (equivalent total doses in 2 Gy fractionation). However, contours superimposed onto the dose distribution of the default plan indicated that an excessive dose 23.64 Gy (up to 268% of the default plan) in pituitary adenoma and 24.84 Gy (131% of the default plan) in meningioma to the optic nerve in the contours from different contouring.

1395,"Elevated mortality among birds in Chernobyl as judged from skewed age and sex ratios BACKGROUND: Radiation has negative effects on survival of animals including humans, although the generality of this claim is poorly documented under low-dose field conditions. Because females may suffer disproportionately from the effects of radiation on survival due to differences in sex roles during reproduction, radiation-induced mortality may result in male-skewed adult sex ratios., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We estimated the effects of low-dose radiation on adult survival rates in birds by determining age ratios of adults captured in mist nets during the breeding season in relation to background radiation levels around Chernobyl and in nearby uncontaminated control areas. Age ratios were skewed towards yearlings, especially in the most contaminated areas, implying that adult survival rates were reduced in contaminated areas, and that populations in such areas could only be maintained through immigration from nearby uncontaminated areas. Differential mortality in females resulted in a strongly male-skewed sex ratio in the most contaminated areas. In addition, males sang disproportionately commonly in the most contaminated areas where the sex ratio was male skewed presumably because males had difficulty finding and acquiring mates when females were rare. The results were not caused by permanent emigration by females from the most contaminated areas because none of the recaptured birds had changed breeding site, and the proportion of individuals with morphological abnormalities did not differ significantly between the sexes for areas with normal and higher levels of contamination., CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the adult survival rate of female birds is particularly susceptible to the effects of low-dose radiation, resulting in male skewed sex ratios at high levels of radiation. Such skewed age ratios towards yearlings in contaminated areas are consistent with the hypothesis that an area exceeding 30,000 km(2) in Chernobyl's surroundings constitutes an ecological trap that causes dramatic excess mortality.",Included
710,"Different patterns of allelic imbalance in sporadic tumors and tumors associated with long-term exposure to gamma-radiation The study aimed to reveal cancer related mutations in DNA repair and cell cycle genes associated with chronic occupational exposure to gamma-radiation in personnel of the Siberian Group of Chemical Enterprises (SGCE). Mutations were analyzed by comparing genotypes of malignant tumors and matched normal tissues of 255 cancer patients including 98 exposed to external gamma-radiation (mean dose 128.1 +/- 150.5 mSv). Also a genetic association analysis was carried out in a sample of 149 cancer patients and 908 healthy controls occupationally exposed to gamma-radiation (153.2 +/- 204.6 mSv and 150.5 +/- 211.2 mSv, respectively). Eight SNPs of genes of DNA excision repair were genotyped (rs13181, rs1052133 , rs1042522, rs2305427, rs4244285, rs1045642, rs1805419 and rs1801133). The mutation profiles in heterozygous loci for selected SNP were different between sporadic tumors and tumors in patients exposed to radiation. In sporadic tumors, heterozygous genotype Arg/Pro of the rs1042522 SNP mutated into Arg/0 in 15 cases (9.6%) and 0/Pro in 14 cases (8.9%). The genotype Lys/Gln of the rs13181 SNP mutated into Lys/0 and 0/Gln in 9 and 4 cases, respectively. In tumors of patients exposed to low-level radiation, the rs1042522 Arg/0 mutated genotype was found in 12 cases (12.1%), while in 2 cases (2%) 0/Pro mutation was observed. Finally, the rs13181 0/Gln mutated genotype was observed in 15 cases (16,5%) Thus, our study showed the difference in patterns of allelic imbalance in tumors appeared under low-level radiation exposure and spontaneous tumors for selected SNPs. This suggests different mechanisms of inactivation of heterozygous genotypes in sporadic and radiation-induced tumors.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Included
3345,"DNA double strand breaks but not interstrand crosslinks prevent progress through meiosis in fully grown mouse oocytes There is some interest in how mammalian oocytes respond to different types of DNA damage because of the increasing expectation of fertility preservation in women undergoing chemotherapy. Double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation and agents such as neocarzinostatin (NCS), and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) induced by alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), are toxic DNA lesions that need to be repaired for cell survival. Here we examined the effects of NCS and MMC treatment on oocytes collected from antral follicles in mice, because potentially such oocytes are readily collected from ovaries and do not need to be in vitro grown to achieve meiotic competency. We found that oocytes were sensitive to NCS, such that this ionizing radiation mimetic blocked meiosis I and caused fragmented DNA. In contrast, MMC had no impact on the completion of either meiosis I or II, even at extremely high doses. However, oocytes treated with MMC did show gamma-H2AX foci and following their in vitro maturation and parthenogenetic activation the development of the subsequent embryos was severely compromised. Addition of MMC to 1-cell embryos caused a similarly poor level of development, demonstrating oocytes have eventual sensitivity to this ICL-inducing agent but this does not occur during their meiotic division. In oocytes, the association of Fanconi Anemia protein, FANCD2, with sites of ICL lesions was not apparent until entry into the embryonic cell cycle. In conclusion, meiotic maturation of oocytes is sensitive to DSBs but not ICLs. The ability of oocytes to tolerate severe ICL damage and yet complete meiosis, means that this type of DNA lesion goes unrepaired in oocytes but impacts on subsequent embryo quality.",Excluded

The operating surgeon can carry out about 10 osteosyntheses per week. For the other members of the operating team the X-ray load is significantly lower and, therefore, there are no limits in practice. It must be noted that an exact record of the fluoroscoping time and dose measurements is absolutely necessary.",Excluded
1866,"Diagnostic Accuracy of Fluoroscopy, Radiography, and Computed Tomography in Detecting Cement Leakage in Kyphoplasty Purpose Cement leakage is a typical complication of kyphoplasty for vertebral fractures. It is unclear if cement application intraoperatively can be improved by using other techniques of visualization and which kind of postoperative imaging should be recommended to detect cement extravasation accurately. Objective To compare the rates of cement leakage detected by intraoperative fluoroscopy, postoperative radiography, and postoperative computed tomography (CT) in a retrospective study. Patients and Methods The study included 78 patients (60 women and 18 men; 115 vertebral bodies) who were treated with two kinds of kyphoplasty. The patients underwent intraoperative fluoroscopy and postoperative radiography and CT. After surgery, the images were evaluated to compare cement leakage rates and locations in the three visualization techniques. Leakage locations were described as epidural, intradiskal, extravertebral, or intravascular. Results Compared with CT, intraoperative fluoroscopy regularly detected intradiskal leakage (75%) but had a considerably lower sensitivity for visualizing epidural (21%), extravertebral (31%), and intravascular (51%) cement leakages. A comparison of radiography and CT showed that radiography had a high sensitivity for detecting intradiskal (82%) and intravascular (70%) cement extrusions but a lower sensitivity in identifying epidural (42%) and extravertebral (50%) leaks. Therefore, the CT scan overall was best in detecting location and accuracy. Conclusion CT detected more cement leaks than any of the other investigated techniques, especially epidural, extravertebral, and intravascular cement leakages. To achieve the best accuracy, only CT provides complete information.Copyright © 2018 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart - New York.",Excluded

The aim of the current paper was to review the clinical presentation of actinic cheilitis and demonstrate the development of management plans using a series of cases. These are designed to provide immediate treatment where required but also to address the medium and long-term requirements of the patient. The authors suggest that the clinical examination of lips and the assessment of actinic cheilitis and other lip pathology become a regular part of the routine soft tissue examination undertaken as a part of the periodic examination of dental patients. Early recognition of actinic cheilitis can allow the development of strategies for individual patients that prevent progression. These are based on past sun exposure, future lifestyle changes and the daily use of emollient sunscreens, broad-brimmed hats and avoidance of sun exposure during the middle of the day. This is a service that is not undertaken as a matter of routine in general medical practice as patients are not seen with the regularity of dental patients and generally not under the ideal examination conditions available in the dental surgery.",Excluded
1362,"Cancers after renal transplantation in Tunisia: Multicenter experience Introduction: Renal transplant recipients are at higher risk of certain tumors such as lymphomas and skin cancers than the general and dialysis populations. Method(s): We retrospectively studied the prevalence of tumors in adult renal transplant recipients in five Tunisian centers of transplantation in Tunis, Monastir, sousse and Sfax from January 1986 to January 2008. Result(s): The study included 52 patients; 32 men and 20 women with a mean age of 36 years (range from 18-54 years). The mean time since dialysis to transplantation was 46 months (20-236 months). Induction therapy was based on thymoglobulin in 100 % and administered in a mean course of 12.4 days in 82,2 % of the patients. Maintenance therapy was based on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in 91,2 % of cases, on antimetabolites and corticosteroids in 100 % of cases. Acute rejection occurred in 36 of these cases and was treated with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies on 40 % of cases. Incidence of cancer among our population was 6,6 % and occurred after a mean period of 55,4 months of transplantation for solid tumors and 99 months for skin tumors. Eighty three percent of the tumors were solid, and the rest were in the skin. Kaposi sarcoma formed 58.6 % and non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin lymphoma 21.7 % of the solid tumors, while spinocellular carcinoma formed 83% and basocellular carcinoma 17% of the skin tumors. Switching CNI to sirolimus in 8.3% cases was associated with a favorable outcome. Mortality was the outcome in 28.3% of the patients with cancer, while partial or complete regression of cancers was observed in 54.7% cases after decreasing the doses of the immunosuppressive medications. Conclusion(s): We conclude that post renal transplant cancer is mainly characterized by the predominance of Kaposi sarcoma favored by solar exposure and excessive Induction and maintenance immunosuppression. Careful follow-up may results in early intervention and decrease mortality.",Excluded

Method(s): Thirteen patients aged between 18 and 33 years old with maxillary transverse deficiency (>=7.0 mm) were evaluated. All patients underwent subtotal Le Fort I osteotomy with separation of the pterygomaxillary suture with the use of Hyrax expander, and were divided into 2 groups: control group (n = 6) and laser group (n = 7). A GaAlAs laser (P = 100 mW, lambda = 830 nm, O = 0.06 cm2) was used. The laser was applied in 8 treatment sessions with intervals of 48 hours. Each treatment session consisted of laser applications, per point (E = 8.4J, ED = 140J/cm2), at 3 points on the MPAS, and total dose of E = 25.2 J, ED = 420 J/cm2. Digital radiographs were taken before the surgical procedure and at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 7-month follow-up visits.

51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
771,"Prospects of application of new photosensitizer Elophit"" in photodynamic therapy for treating some dermatologic diseases"" Purpose: Purpose of the present work was to study photosensitizer (PS) Elophit"" effectiveness for PDT sessions in some dermatologic diseases. Material(s) and Method(s): Gel ""Elophit"" is a complex substance containing chlorins E6 (0.5%), copper chlorophyllin (0.5%), hyaluronic acid (2%) (conformance certificate No. ROSS RU.IM; 25130 2322). Therapeutic effects are produced not only due to the chlorin E6 photodynamic (PDT) action but also due to the action of copper derivatives which have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects. The preparation easily penetrates into the skin and accumulates in inflammatory foci. Gel ""Elophit"" was put on skin lesions 40 min before PDT session. Before the session preparation remnants were removed off the skin with a mild alcohol solution. PDT was performed in 12 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form) (4 males, 8 females), 8 patients with superficial forms of streptostaphylodermias (5 males, 3 females). Controls were 24 patients with Acne vulgaris (papulla-pustular form), 20 patients with streptostaphylodermias. Age - 17-58 years old, disease duration from 1 week to 6 years. Patients from the control group received traditional therapy without PDT component. Device ""Soljaris"" with incorporated diodes in the range 660 mum, irradiation power 400 mW was used as a light source. Irradiation was done in a scan manner (70-270 J/cm2). Sessions - twice a week. Research results were assessed by changes in the clinical picture using biophometry techniques with laser therapeutic apparatus ""Milta F-8-01"" having an in-built biophotometer. These changes are shown in photomaterials. FS accumulation degree in the skin was determined with spectrometry (apparatus ""LESA-01-BIOSPEC""). Result(s): A complete rash regression after 4-8 PDT sessions (in 2 weeks - 1 month) was seen in 8 (66.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris, in 5 (62.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia; in the rest of patients a considerable clinical improvement was seen. No changes in clinical picture during PDT treatment was seen in 2 (16.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 1 (12.5%) patients with streptostaphylodermia. In the controls one month later a clinical remission was seen in 10 (41.6%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 11 (55%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, no changes - in 7 (29.1%) patients with Acne vulgaris and in 6 (30%) patients with streptostaphylodermias, in the rest of patients - a partial rash regression. A fluorescent examination has shown less FS fluorescence (by 60-75%) in the skin after irradiation what indicates a marked phodynamic effect with a considerable discharge of singlet oxygen. Clinical observations have been confirmed by the results of biophotometric examinations of skin lesions when one could see changes typical for decreased or resorpted inflammatory processes. Conclusion(s): Thus, as it has been shown by preliminary findings PDT with photosensitizer ""Elophit"" may be an effective technique for treating some dermatologic pathologies. Further researches are needed to study better effectiveness of PDT with gel ""Elophit"" application in dermatologic practice so as to determine indications and to develop optimal schemes for treatment.""",Excluded
2612,"Relationship between anthropometric factors, radiation exposure, and colon cancer incidence in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors PURPOSE: We examined colon cancer risk in atomic bomb survivors to investigate whether excess body weight after the bombings alters sensitivity to radiation effects., METHODS: Of the 56,064 Japanese atomic bomb survivors with follow-up through 2002 with self-reported anthropometric data obtained from periodic mail surveys, 1,142 were diagnosed with colon cancer. We evaluated the influence of body mass index (BMI) and height on radiation-associated colon cancer risk using Poisson regression., RESULTS: We observed a similar linear dose-response relationship for the 56,064 subjects included in our analysis and the entire cohort of Japanese atomic bomb survivors [excess relative risk (ERR) per Gray (Gy) = 0.53, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.25-0.86]. Elevation in earliest reported BMI, BMI reported closest to colon cancer diagnosis, and time-varying BMI were associated with an elevated risk of colon cancer [relative risk (RR) per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI = 1.14, 95 % CI 1.03-1.26; RR = 1.16, 95 % CI 1.05-1.27; and RR = 1.15, 95 % CI 1.04-1.27, respectively]. Height was not significantly related to colon cancer risk. Inclusion of anthropometric variables in models had little impact on radiation risk estimates, and there was no evidence that sensitivity to the effect of radiation on colon cancer risk depended on BMI., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation exposure and BMI are both risk factors for colon cancer. BMI at various times after exposure to the atomic bombings does not significantly influence the relationship between radiation dose and colon cancer risk, suggesting that BMI and radiation impact colon cancer risk independently of each other.",Included
2760,"Butterfly wing colours: scale beads make white pierid wings brighter The wing-scale morphologies of the pierid butterflies Pieris rapae (small white) and Delias nigrina (common jezabel), and the heliconine Heliconius melpomene are compared and related to the wing-reflectance spectra. Light scattering at the wing scales determines the wing reflectance, but when the scales contain an absorbing pigment, reflectance is suppressed in the absorption wavelength range of the pigment. The reflectance of the white wing areas of P. rapae, where the scales are studded with beads, is considerably higher than that of the white wing areas of H. melpomene, which has scales lacking beads. The beads presumably cause the distinct matt-white colour of the wings of pierids and function to increase the reflectance amplitude. This will improve the visual discrimination between conspecific males and females. Copyright 2004 The Royal Society",Excluded
2847,"Trends in the incidence of sudden deaths and heart diseases in fukushima after the great east Japan earthquake On March 11, 2011, a great earthquake, known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, hit northeastern Japan, resulting in a tsunami that caused a nuclear disaster, the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. We, therefore, sought to examine the effects of this evacuation on the onset of cardiovascular diseases and sudden death (SD) in Fukushima Prefecture, three years after the earthquake. We divided the evacuation zone into two areas, whole evacuation zone (Area 1) and partial evacuation zone (Area 2), and we defined the north district of the prefecture as the control area (Area 3). We cross-referenced the death certificate data with data from the Fukushima Prefecture acute myocardial infarction registration survey. For each area, we tallied the number of people who fell into the SD, myocardial infarction (MI), and MI suspected groups. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence rates and analyzed the differences in the adjusted incidence rates across three years using a Poisson regression model. The age-adjusted death rate of the SD group was significantly higher in 2011 in all areas than in 2012 or 2013 (P < 0.05). The total death rate was higher in Area 1 in March 2011, just after the disaster, than in the other two areas. The rate of SD was also higher in Area 1 than in the other areas in March 2011. The incidence of sudden cardiac death might have increased just after the Great East Japan Earthquake in the evacuation area, but not in other areas in Fukushima Prefecture.Copyright © 2019, International Heart Journal Association.

1179,"Analysis of entrance surface dose in general radiographies using body mass index classification Dose audit is an important topic in radiology and variations in dose attributable to sex have not been fully investigated. The primary purpose of our study was to determine the entrance surface dose (ESD) for men and women, from which we established an easy estimation equation for ESD, using the body mass index (BMI) as a variable. From April 2000 to March 2002, 15424 patients (8586 men, 6838 women; mean age, 58 years old; age range, 20 to 90 years old) were recruited in this study. Estimated equation of ESD was obtained from the dispersion data of BMI and ESD. Welch's t-test was used as the test of significance. P values evaluated levels of significance at 5%. Analysis for correlation coefficients was used for Peason's correlation coefficient test. And, we also performed a simple regression analysis. The results of the simple regression equation with BMI as variable (y: ESD [mGy], x: BMI [kg/m(2)), and the median values of ESD were as follows: for chest PA, men, 0.22, y = 0.0145 x - 0.0876, women, 0.20, y = 0.0126 x - 0.0704; for abdomen AP, men, 2.12, y = 0.2707 x - 3.7206, women, 1.65, y = 0.2561 x - 3.7989; for pelvis AP, men, 1.87, y = 0.0517 x + 0.8753, women, 1.77, y = 0.0674 x + 0.4775; for lumbar spine AP, men, 3.08, y = 0.3462 x - 4.1416, women, 2.66, y = 0.2525 x - 2.8131; and for lumbar spine lateral, men, 9.31, y = 0.6012 x - 3.7216, women, 7.42, y = 0.3147 x + 0.3384. The results of ESD had a significant difference between sexes (P < 0.05).

The entrance surface dose (ESD) for the patients was assessed by an indirect method, using the patient's anatomical data and exposure parameters utilised for the specific examination and a Quality Assurance Dose Database software developed by Integrated Radiological Services Ltd in Liverpool, UK. The study showed variations in the ESDs for chest examinations with five of the hospitals having values above the internationally recommended levels. ESDs for lumbar spine anterior-posterior and lateral projections were within acceptable limits. Diagnostic reference levels proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection based on patient dose data are imperative to the current Ghanaian situation and will lead to a reduction of the radiation dose.",Excluded

Depending on the localization of the tumor, dissection of one or more of the rectus muscles is necessary during placement of the plaque or during the course of protracted irradiation. Orthoptic investigations were performed to evaluate the cause of motility disorders and to follow up the functional outcome. In 13 patients (out of 30) who underwent ruthenium-106 therapy for uveal melanomas, one or more muscles had to be dissected during placement of the plaque and were reinserted in the same operation or after removal of the applicator. In 4 cases rectus muscles had to be shifted and were replaced after the irradiation. There were 5 patients who developed motility disorders with double vision.

210,"Intracranial germ cell tumors: A singleinstitution experience BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intracranial germ cell tumors (GCTs) are not a common disease. We reviewed the experience of a single institution to determine the variables that affect treatment outcome. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis of intracranial germ cell tumors treated in a single institution (KFSHRC) during the period from March 1985 to December 2007. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with the diagnosis of intracranial GCT were recorded in the KFSHRC Tumor Registry during the period from 1985 to 2007. Seven patients with a pineal region tumor treated as germinomas in the earlier years without a tissue diagnosis were excluded. This retrospective study was restricted to the remaining 50 patients with a tissue or marker diagnosis: 31 germinomas and 19 non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCTs). RESULT(S): The 10-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 87%, 88% and 96% for patients with germinoma, with a median follow-up of 4.5 (range 2-17) years, compared with 26%, 29% and 46% for patients with NGGCT with a median follow-up of 3 (range 1.5-13) years. For NGGCT, variables favorably influencing OS were younger age (< 16 y vs >=16 y, P=.01), higher radiation dose (>50 Gy vs <=50 Gy; P=.03) and later year of diagnosis (>1990 vs <1990 P=.002). CONCLUSION(S): Tissue diagnosis of GCTs is mandatory prior to treatment except for patients with elevated markers. In germinoma, localized radiotherapy (RT) for M0 patients may be adequate. Long-term follow-up is needed to define the benefit of adding chemotherapy. For NGGCT, the use of combined modality treatment and RT dose >50 Gy are important factors that influence the outcome.

1154,"Up-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in radiation-induced heart injury in rats To explore the expression level and the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) in radiation-induced heart injury in a rat model, thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (the control group, the 15-Gy irradiation group and the 18-Gy irradiation group). Experimental animals were exposed to radiation generated by a linear accelerator at the chest and killed after 3 months. Heart tissues from these animals were removed for Masson staining, PPAR-gamma immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein expression of matrix metalloprotein-1 (MMP-1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and transforming growth factor type beta1 (TGF-beta1), all of which are associated with fibrosis, was measured. Masson staining revealed significant myocardial fibrosis, degeneration and necrosis in rats exposed to radiation. The results of immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis showed that PPAR-gamma protein expression in hearts of the irradiation groups was significantly higher than in the control group, especially in myocardium and vascular endothelial (p < 0.05). RT-PCR results also showed a parallel increase in PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in the heart of the irradiation groups compared with the control group (p < 0.05). The expression of MMP-1 protein was not significantly different in three groups (p > 0.05). The expression of TIMP-1 and TGF-beta1 proteins was, however, higher in two irradiation groups than in the control group (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that PPAR-gamma expression is up-regulated on both mRNA and protein levels in heart injured by radiation.

The diagnosis of CS followed work-up for sensorineural hearing loss, which revealed bilateral internal auditory canal stenosis. On presentation, she complained of daily frontal headaches, weekly migraines and right knee pain. Medical history was remarkable for a cleft palate, delayed dental eruptions, hearing loss necessitating hearing aids and irregular menses. She had not sustained any fractures. Family history was negative for bone disorders, neurological disorders or endocrinopathies. Examination revealed a well-nourished female below the mid-parental height who was normocephalic with evidence of a prominent jaw, blue sclera and hypertelorism. Musculoskeletal exam was remarkable for scoliosis and shortened 4th and 5th metacarpals. Neurologic exam was remarkable for myopia and deafness. She had a normal intellect. Work-up revealed normal bone specific alk phos, TRAP, calcium, phosphate, PTH and IGF-1 levels. 24 hr urine calcium studies were normal. Vitamin D level was 21ng/ml. Head CT imaging revealed diffuse osteosclerosis of the calvarium and the skull base with osseous encroachment of the bilateral middle ear cavities. There was hypo-pneumatization of the mastoid, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses. DXA scan showed Z scores of: 4.1 at lumbar spine, 2.0 at left total hip, 4.7 at left femoral neck and -1.5 at 1/3 radius. Thoracic spine X-ray showed mild scoliosis. Radiographs of the femurs revealed vertically orientated sclerotic striations extending from the metaphysis to the diaphysis.

We describe a system for recording the electrical conductance of skin as a measure of sweat gland function., PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 22 normal volunteers close agreement was obtained between measurements obtained from comparable sites on both sides of the chest. Measurements were subsequently made in 38 patients treated by radiotherapy to one side of the chest for tumours of the breast or lung using one of five different fractionation schedules. Simultaneous readings were obtained from both sides of the chest with the non irradiated side acting as a control., RESULTS: A dose response relationship was demonstrated: five patients who received the equivalent total dose of 15 Gy in 2-Gy fractions showed no change in conductance. Sixteen out of 23 who received an equivalent total dose of 42-46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions had a greater than 22% reduction in mean skin conductance compared with that of the control areas despite the skin appearing normal in the large majority. Marked changes in skin conductance were seen after higher total doses. In a prospective study 18 women receiving breast irradiation underwent weekly readings during treatment. A mean reduction of 40% in skin conductance was noted by the end of the second week of treatment prior to any clinical evidence of radiation change. Skin conductance returned to normal in 44% of patients by 6 months. In the remainder, those patients who showed the greatest reduction in skin conductance during treatment demonstrated the least recovery., CONCLUSIONS: Changes in sweat gland function can be detected and quantified in skin which may otherwise appear normal. Differences may so be demonstrated between areas treated using different fractionation schedules and the method may be applied to the detection during radiotherapy of unusually sensitive patient.",Excluded

A relationship between low-density lipoprotein oxidation and radioiodine therapy-related side effects, consequently inducing increased formation of 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (PGF(2 alpha)) in situ, has recently been reported by several investigators. Isoprostanes, among them 8-epi-PGF(2 alpha), have been associated with increased oxidation injury due to various pathologic conditions in vivo.

Background(s): The use of RT3DTEE to guide a transcatheter radiofrequency ablation procedure has never been systematically investigated. Method(s): Seventy consecutive patients with CVTI-dependent atrial flutter underwent CVTI ablation. Procedural monitoring using RT3DTEE was assigned to patients who requested general anesthesia for the procedure (n = 21 [30%]). In the other 49 patients (the control group), the procedures were monitored using the standard fluoroscopic approach. Procedural time was considered as skin-to-skin electrophysiological procedure duration, not including anesthesia preparation; adequate radiofrequency ablation applications (with fixed temperature and power settings) were considered as lesions lasting < 60 s. Result(s): RT3DTEE allowed visualization of the CVTI and identified related structures in most patients (20 of 21); anatomic features such as long CVTI (n = 11), prominent Eustachian ridge (n = 9), prominent Eustachian valve (n = 6), septal recess (n = 8), and pectinate muscles (n = 10) were frequent. Also, RT3DTEE allowed continuous visualization of ablation catheter movement and contact. Compared with the control group, RT3DTEE was equally effective in achieving CVTI bidirectional block (100% in both groups), and no complications occurred. RT3DTEE shortened procedural time (median 73.0 min, interquartile range [IQR] 60.0 to 90.0 min, vs. median 115.0 min, IQR 85.0 to 133.0 min, p < 0.001), reduced radiation exposure (median fluoroscopy time 4.2 min, IQR 3.1 to 8.4 min, vs. median 19.3 min, IQR 12.9 to 36.4 min, p < 0.001; median fluoroscopy dose 575.4 cGy . cm2, IQR 428.5 to 1,299.4 cGy . cm2, vs. median 3,520.7 cGy . cm2, IQR 1,700.0 to 6,709.0 cGy . cm2, p < 0.001), and reduced the number of radiofrequency applications to achieve bidirectional block (median 7, IQR 6 to 10, vs. median 12, IQR 10 to 22, p = 0.007). A strong learning curve was detected by comparing procedural data between the first and last patients treated using RT3DTEE.

In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) when used for patients with intractable cluster headache (CH). Methods. Four participating centers of the North American Gamma Knife Consortium identified 17 patients who underwent GKS for intractable CH between 1996 and 2008. The median patient age was 47 years (range 26-83 years). The median duration of pain before GKS was 10 years (range 1.3-40 years). Seven patients underwent unsuccessful prior surgical procedures, including microvascular decompression (2 patients), microvascular decompression with glycerol rhizotomy (2 patients), deep brain stimulation (1 patient), trigeminal ganglion stimulation (1 patient), and prior GKS (1 patient). Fourteen patients had associated autonomic symptoms. The radiosurgical target was the trigeminal nerve (TN) root and the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in 8 patients, only the TN in 8 patients, and only the SPG in 1 patient. The median maximum TN and SPG dose was 80 Gy. Results. Favorable pain relief (Barrow Neurological Institute Grades I-IIIb) was achieved and maintained in 10 (59%) of 17 patients at a median follow-up of 34 months. Three patients required additional procedures (repeat GKS in 2 patients, hypothalamic deep brain stimulation in 1 patient). Eight (50%) of 16 patients who had their TN irradiated developed facial sensory dysfunction after GKS. Conclusions. Gamma Knife surgery for intractable, medically refractory CH provided lasting pain reduction in approximately 60% of patients, but was associated with a significantly greater chance of facial sensory disturbances than GKS used for trigeminal neuralgia.",Excluded

3141,"Keratinocyte apoptosis in epidermal remodeling and clearance of psoriasis induced by UV radiation Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder, but the mechanisms involved in the resolution and clearance of plaques remain poorly defined. We investigated the mechanism of action of UVB, which is highly effective in clearing psoriasis and inducing remission, and tested the hypothesis that apoptosis is a key mechanism. To distinguish bystander effects, equal erythemal doses of two UVB wavelengths were compared following in vivo irradiation of psoriatic plaques; one is clinically effective (311 nm) and one has no therapeutic effect on psoriasis (290 nm). Only 311 nm UVB induced significant apoptosis in lesional epidermis, and most apoptotic cells were keratinocytes. To determine clinical relevance, we created a computational model of psoriatic epidermis. Modeling predicted apoptosis would occur in both stem and transit-amplifying cells to account for plaque clearance; this was confirmed and quantified experimentally. The median rate of keratinocyte apoptosis from onset to cell death was 20 minutes. These data were fed back into the model and demonstrated that the observed level of keratinocyte apoptosis was sufficient to explain UVB-induced plaque resolution. Our human studies combined with a systems biology approach demonstrate that keratinocyte apoptosis is a key mechanism in psoriatic plaques clearance, providing the basis for future molecular investigation and therapeutic development.",Excluded

METHOD(S): From January 1996 to January 2000, 380 NPC patients were divided into conventional fraction (CF-175 patients), late-course accelerated hyperfractionation (LCAF-63 patients) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT-142 patients) groups. Conventional radiotherapy was given with a total dose of 70 Gy. Patients in the LCAF group were treated with the same fractionation as CF group until the dose of 36 - 40 Gy, then followed by LCAF radiotherapy to a total dose of 75 Gy.

Result(s): In 30 patients, radiotherapy obtained a reduction of symptoms within 5-9 days. However, in seven patients, radiotherapy had to be stopped early because of local progress and tumor induced complications. Local recurrences were observed in six patients. The 1-year overall survival rate was 15.6%. Survival rate depended significantly on the performance status (p<0.004). Conclusion(s): Based on literature data our results are comparable regarding the incidence, the radio-oncological procedure and the response to treatment. These data confirm that radiotherapy is the standard treatment in most patients suffering from SVCS. However, it should be determined if endovascular stenting, which is more frequently considered in the last few years in patients with a tumor induced SVCS, may be a useful option as a simultaneous or sequentially given treatment to optimize the palliative effect.",Excluded
888,"Eighty-peak kilovoltage 16-channel multidetector computed tomography and reduced contrast-medium doses tailored to body weight to diagnose pulmonary embolism in azotaemic patients The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of minimising contrast-medium (CM) doses using 80-peak kilovoltage (kVp) 16-channel multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) with CM dose tailored to body weight, when diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) in azotaemic patients. Twenty-nine patients (68-93 years; 38-79 kg) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 12-49 ml/min underwent 80 kVp MDCT at a median dose of 200 mg iodine (I)/kg and 15 s injection time. Pulmonary artery (PA) enhancement where compared with our own reference material using 320 mg I/kg at 120 kVp and with reported figures in the literature at 120-140 kVp and a 42 g iodine CM dose. Median (1st and 3rd quartiles) values regarding CM dose were 12.2 (9.9-12.8) g iodine; density of left main and lower lobe segmental PA 339 (275-395) Hounsfield units (HU) and 354 (321-442) HU, respectively. Those enhancement values were similar to those obtained from the reference population at 120 kVp and those reported in the literature at 120-140 kVp. One patient had a transient increase in plasma creatinine. Three months' follow-up revealed deep venous thrombosis among 1/18 patients with negative results from computed tomography (CT). We conclude that 80 kVp 16-channel MDCT to diagnose PE in azotaemic patients may be performed with markedly reduced CM doses, implying a lesser risk for CM-induced nephropathy.",Excluded
615,"MRI can play a decisive role in establishing acute and chronic muscle infarction as the primary and often unsuspected cause of sickle cell crisis: A 20-year follow-up of prior and current cases Objective: To demonstrate that MRI rather than radionuclide, CT, ultrasound or PET scans is most efficient and specific in establishing muscle infarction as the primary cause of sickle cell crisis. MRI can therefore serve as a basis for initiating prompt treatment in the emergency department or nontreatment in the setting of suspected addiction. Longstanding chronic changes are also important to recognize. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty patients with sickle cell disease included 17 patients followed for 20 years (6 male, 11 female; age range, 17-55 years, 15 with sickle cell anemia and 2 sickle beta thalassemia) with MRI-documented muscle infarcts initially imaged within 24-72 hours of limb pain utilizing Phillips 0.5-T superconductive magnets with interim and more recent studies using superconductive 1.5- and 3-T magnets (Sigma, GE Healthcare), dedicated extremity coils, and T1-weighted, fast spin-echo, fat-saturated, and fluid-sensitive sequences. Result(s): All studies showed acute and chronic abnormal MRI soft-tissue patterns. One third of lower limbs (20 of 60 prior patients) had focally increased signal loci compatible with acute or subacute inflammation, edema, or both associated with hemorrhage or ischemia. In cases without SI alteration in bone or soft tissue, sickle cell crisis could not be substantiated. In the 20 limbs with increased SI loci followed for 20 years, changes ranged from diminishing signal alterations to complete, often bilaterally symmetric curvilinear or rectangular signal voids attributed to infarcts or fibrosis. Recent radiographs when interpreted without adequate history or referral to prior MR studies showed large focal ossifications at one of multiple sites in upper and lower limbs compatible with myositis ossificans without known conventional trauma. Conclusion(s): MR imaging can function as an effective problem solver in patients with sickle cell disease with extremity pain without definitive evidence on multiple other imaging modalities in instances of suspected sickle cell crisis. Chronic or long delayed soft-tissue changes of sickle cell crisis are important to recognize along with muscle involvement in an acute crisis. The latter leads to prompt treatment in the emergency department or no treatment in instances of suspected addiction. Chronic soft-tissue changes are also important since they may be mistaken for nonspecific entities, e.g., myositis ossificans in all stages of repair and resolution on the commonly used imaging modalities in modern practice. Routine radiographs most specifically document mature ossifications.",Excluded
2820,"The impact of PET/CT on radiotherapy of anal cancer Purpose: To compare Transanal endoscopic Ultrasound (TAUS) and abdominal Ultrasound (US) with PET/CT in detecting regional lymph noDe metastases in patients with anal cancer. The impact of the PET/CT on the treatment plan was evaluated. Materials: Ninety-five (95) patients referred to our clinic between July 1st 2005 and December 31 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had biopsy-proven primary squamous cell cancer of the anal canal. There were 65 females (68%) and 30 males (32%), and the median age was 58 (age range 35-88 years). All patients were staged during anaesthesia with 3- Dimensional Transanal Endoscopic Ultrasound (TAUS) and US of the inguinal regions. Seventy-seven (77) patients were furthermore examined with US of the abdomen. All 95 patients underwent whole-body FDG-PET/CT as part of radiotherapy planning. The detection of suspicious perirectal, internal iliac and inguinal lymph nodes by TAUS/US and PET/CT, respectively, was evaluated. Suspicious perirectal and internal iliac lymph noDe were not biopsied. Suspicious inguinal lymph nodes were biopsied with few exceptions. Result(s): Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with suspicious perirectal noDe metastases. TAUS identified 24 of the patients. PET/CT identified 15, nine of which had not been seen on TAUS. Eleven patients were diagnosed with suspicious internal iliac noDe metastases, all of which were detected on PET/CT. One of these patients had not been examined with abdominal US. US diagnosed suspicious internal iliac nodes in one patient.Inguinal nodes suspicious of malignancy were visualized on either US or PET/CT in 41 patients. Seventeen (17) of these had confirmed malignant disease on biopsy, and 15 had confirmed benign disease. All 17 patients (100%) with malignant inguinal nodes were diagnosed by PET/CT, whereas US identified 16 of the 17 patients (94%). PET/CT detected suspicious inguinal nodes in 10 patients, which had not been seen on US. On biopsies one of these was proven malignant, three were benign and six did not have any biopsy. Five patients had their treatment changed from radiotherapy alone to concomitant chemoradiotherapy due to the finding of lymph noDe metastases on the PET/CT. Two of these patients had suspicious perirectal nodes, one patient had internal iliac nodes, and the final two patients had inguinal lymph noDe metastasis, of which one was proven malignant on biopsy, and in the other case no biopsy was performed.Six patients were radiated on either one or both inguinal regions as a consequence of additional inguinal noDe metastases detected on the PET/CT. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): Compared to TAUS/US,PET/CT seems important for especially the N2/3-stage in anal cancer and resulted in additional inguinal irradiation of either one or both sides in six patients. The detection of additional lymph noDe metastases on PET/CT resulted in five patients receiving concomitant chemoradiotherapy instead of radiotherapy alone. It is a limitation of this study that not all suspicious lymph nodes were biopsied. However, the true sensitivity and specificity of any staging technique cannot be determined unless the patients undergo a full lymph noDe exairesis. Finally, a minor part of the patients had not been examined with US of the abdomen which makes it impossible to compare PET/CT and US regarding the detection of internal iliac metastases in these cases.",Excluded
2220,"The second oncogenic step Three theories of the development of a malignant change which each involve two successive steps are described. Armitage, Doll (1957) proposed that two homologous chromosomes each contained a region which was critical in the control of cell division. The two steps were mutations in these regions brought about by random exposure to carcinogenic agents. Comings (1973) proposed a similar theory but the two steps were considered to be spontaneous mutatons. This paper points out that if one mutation has occurred this can become dominant in at least six ways which mostly involve chromosome translocations. The synergism between oncogenic agents and ionizing radiation and the ability to breed out high and low cancer incidence stocks of animals from a common stock can be explained on the same lines.",Excluded

We have recently studied the LSP in spatial scattering planes, denoted as the cell's ""3D fingerprint,"" for mature and immature lymphocyte cells in human peripheral blood. The effects of membrane size, morphology, and the existence of the nucleus on the spatial LSP are discussed. In order to distinguish clinical label-free mature and immature lymphocytes, the special features of the spatial LSP are studied by statistical method in both the spatial and frequency domains. Spatial LSP provides rich information on the cell's morphology and contents, which can distinguish mature from immature lymphocyte cells and hence ultimately it may be a useful label-free technique for clinical leukemia diagnosis.",Excluded
252,"Removal of comfort pads underneath babies: a method of reducing radiation exposure to neonates RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increasing utilization of imaging has increased the population exposure to ionizing radiation. With increasing knowledge of the potential harm of radiation exposure, efforts should be made to minimize patient radiation whenever possible, especially in young children. The purpose of this study was to use the exposure index (EI) standard to assess the potential for reducing radiation dose to babies by removing a soft comfort pad, often placed underneath the baby. The pad is located between the baby and the image detector plate. As such it absorbs x-rays that have already passed through the baby but have not yet reached the imaging detector plate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a thoracic infant phantom and fixed exposure factors, we measured the percentage of the radiation exiting a neonatal chest phantom that was absorbed/attenuated by the comfort pad, before it hit the detector to create the image. We studied comfort pads of 4 different thicknesses, ranging from 0.5 to 8. RESULTS: Radiation beam attenuation, ranging from 12% to 72.1%, was found with all comfort pads, with increased x-ray beam attenuation occurring with increasing pad thickness. CONCLUSIONS: The study shows that comfort pads cause a high attenuation of the radiation beam, after it exits the chest phantom. As such, removal of the pads prior to radiographic exposure of babies is a method of potentially reducing patient radiation exposure in the newborn nursery.",Excluded
246,"3D histomorphometric quantification of trabecular bones by computed microtomography using synchrotron radiation Conventional bone histomorphometry is an important method for quantitative evaluation of bone microstructure. X-ray computed microtomography is a non-invasive technique, which can be used to evaluate histomorphometric indices in trabecular bones (BV/TV, BS/BV, Tb.N, Tb.Th, Tb.Sp). In this technique, 3D images are used to quantify the whole sample, differently from the conventional one, in which the quantification is performed in 2D slices and extrapolated for 3D case. In this work, histomorphometric quantification using synchrotron 3D X-ray computed microtomography was performed to quantify the bone structure at different skeletal sites as well as to investigate the effects of bone diseases on quantitative understanding of bone architecture. The images were obtained at Synchrotron Radiation for MEdical Physics (SYRMEP) beamline, at ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility, Italy. Concerning the obtained results for normal and pathological bones from same skeletal sites and individuals, from our results, a certain declining bone volume fraction was achieved. The results obtained could be used in forming the basis for comparison of the bone microarchitecture and can be a valuable tool for predicting bone fragility. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Material(s) and Method(s): Seventy-five patients were identified. Survival curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the charts of the 62 patients referred to a British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) facility were reviewed. Result(s): All cases: 51 out of 75 patients (68%) were women; median age of all patients was 74 years. The overall- and cancer-specific 5-year survival rates for the whole group were 5%. Non-referred cases: nine out of 13 patients were women; median age at diagnosis 84 years. Eleven of the 13 patients died within 1 month of diagnosis. Referred cases: 42 out of 62 patients were women; median age 72 years; median survival 5.1 months; 1-year survival 19%. Forty-eight patients presented with tumours that extended through the thyroid capsule, 10 presented with distant metastases. Four patients had a total thyroidectomy, nine a partial thyroidectomy, and 49 a biopsy only. Fifty-seven patients received radiotherapy, nine of these had concurrent chemotherapy: Thirty-three patients received less than 40 Gy and 24 patients received 40 Gy or more. Median survival was longer (9 vs 3 months) in patients receiving 40 Gy or more; this group included four patients who had prolonged survival.

759,"Changes in symptom clusters in patients undergoing radiation therapy GOALS OF WORK: The goals of the study were to determine the occurrence rates for and the severity of symptoms at the middle, end, and 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy (RT), to determine the number and types of symptom clusters at these three time points, and to evaluate for changes over time in these symptom clusters., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Symptom occurrence and severity were evaluated using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) in a sample of patients (n = 160) who underwent RT for breast or prostate cancer. At each time point, an exploratory factor analysis was done to determine the number of symptom clusters (i.e., symptom factors) based on the MSAS symptom severity ratings., MAIN RESULTS: The majority of the patients were male and married with a mean age of 61.1 years. The five symptoms with the highest occurrence rates across all three time points were lack of energy, pain, difficulty sleeping, feeling drowsy, and sweats. Although the number of symptoms and the specific symptoms within each symptom cluster were not identical across the three time points, three relatively similar symptom clusters (i.e., mood-cognitive"" symptom cluster, ""sickness-behavior"" symptom cluster, ""treatment-related"", or ""pain"" symptom cluster) were identified in this sample. The internal consistency coefficients for the mood-cognitive symptom cluster and sickness-behavior symptom cluster were adequate at > or =0.68., CONCLUSIONS: Three relatively stable symptom clusters were found across RT. The majority of the symptom cluster severity scores were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer compared to patients with prostate cancer.""",Included

With this technique the lymph node groups needing a treatment can be irradiated without overlappings or gaps, and thus the therapy reliability is considerably improved. The side effects are limited with respect to the large volume dose, in the individual case they can easily be eliminated by reducing the single dose. Gastrointestinal side effects can be controlled by chemotherapy in a satisfactory manner. Only in very few cases the modifications of the white blood count necessitated a short interruption of the therapy cycle. Furthermore, the simplified and easily reproducible focussing of the individual fields is especially appreciated by the technical staff.",Excluded
819,"Role of aortic calcification, stiffness and wave reflections in cardiovascular risk in dialysis patients: Baseline data from the CORD study Background: Accurate cardiovascular risk estimation in dialysis patients remains challenging because different pathogenetic mechanisms act simultaneously in this heterogeneous population. Radiographic calcification, aortic stiffness and wave reflection, have each individually been proven to be reliable surrogate markers for outcome. We aimed to explore to what extent these parameters intermutually provide complementary or overlapping information. Method(s): Abdominal aortic calcification scoring of a plain lateral abdominal X-ray, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), and central augmentation index (AIx) were measured in 1084 dialysis patients, recruited from 47 European dialysis centers. Result(s): Abdominal calcification correlated well with PWV (R = 0.44, P < 0.001) but poorly with AIx (R = 0.07, P = 0.04). Next to abdominal calcification, tertiles of PWV were associated with a stepwise increase age, blood pressure, and cardiovascular history, and tertiles of AIx with age, heart rate, and anthropometric factors. In multivariate analysis, only PWV remained significantly associated with calcification score. In addition to age and blood pressure, stiffness was mainly related to diabetes and calcification score (R2 = 0.39, P < 0.001), whereas AIx was more dependent on anthropometry, gender and heart rate (R2 = 0.36, P < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Information on aortic calcification and arterial abnormalities can be obtained by simple and inexpensive methodologies. Variation in wave reflections was mainly explained by anthropometric parameters. Stiffness and calcification partly provided complementary information, particularly in low-risk patients. In this group, likely to benefit most from preventive strategies and commonly considered for renal transplantation, evaluation of cardiovascular risk could be made more accurate by the assessment of both aortic calcification and arterial stiffness. © 2010 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.",Excluded
361,"Late side effects of radioactive iodine on salivary gland function in patients with thyroid cancer BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the late side effects of radioiodine therapy (RIT) on salivary gland function. One hundred eighty two patients were evaluated., METHODS: Assessment of salivary gland function was performed with salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), sialometry, and subjective open questions to determine common side effects of RIT on salivary gland function., RESULTS: RIT had a strong association with decreased elimination counts by SGS. Patient age was the only variable associated with sialometry; age and the use of xerostomic drugs were strongly associated with decreased mean values of salivary flow. Dysphagia was strongly associated with RIT. Using multiple logistic regression analysis, age was determined to be an important factor associated with salivary gland dysfunction, and RIT was associated with impairment of saliva excretion., CONCLUSION: These results show that patients subjected to RIT have more difficulty in draining saliva, mainly from the parotid glands, which is associated with clinical dysphagia in this subset of patients.

Here we present a new multiphoton photo-excitation method, termed three-dimensional scanless holographic optogenetics with temporal focusing (3D-SHOT), which allows precise, simultaneous photo-activation of arbitrary sets of neurons anywhere within the addressable volume of a microscope. This technique uses point-cloud holography to place multiple copies of a temporally focused disc matching the dimensions of a neuron's cell body. Experiments in cultured cells, brain slices, and in living mice demonstrate single-neuron spatial resolution even when optically targeting randomly distributed groups of neurons in 3D.

3012,"Comprehensive toxicity risk profiling in radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: A new concept for individually optimised treatment Background and purpose: A comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile is needed to improve radiation treatment optimisation, minimising toxicity burden, in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. We aimed to develop and externally validate NTCP models for various toxicities at multiple time points. Material(s) and Method(s): Using logistic regression, we determined the relationship between normal tissue irradiation and the risk of 22 toxicities at ten time points during and after treatment in 750 HNC patients. The toxicities involved swallowing, salivary, mucosal, speech, pain and general complaints. Studied predictors included patient, tumour and treatment characteristics and dose parameters of 28 organs. The resulting NTCP models were externally validated in 395 HNC patients. Result(s): The NTCP models involved 14 organs that were associated with at least one toxicity. The oral cavity was the predominant organ, associated with 12 toxicities. Other important organs included the parotid and submandibular glands, buccal mucosa and swallowing muscles. In addition, baseline toxicity, treatment modality, and tumour site were common predictors of toxicity. The median discrimination performance (AUC) of the models was 0.71 (interquartile range: 0.68-0.75) at internal validation and 0.67 (interquartile range: 0.62-0.71) at external validation. Conclusion(s): We established a comprehensive individual toxicity risk profile that provides essential insight into how radiation exposure of various organs translates into multiple acute and late toxicities. This comprehensive understanding of radiation-induced toxicities enables a new radiation treatment optimisation concept that balances multiple toxicity risks simultaneously and minimises the overall toxicity burden for an individual HNC patient who needs to undergo radiation treatment.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Excluded
1089,"Correlation between normal tissue complications and in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from radiotherapy patients treated for variety of tumors PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between fibroblast intrinsic radiosensitivity in vitro and late reactions of normal tissues in patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for variety of tumors., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patients were selected for this study. They were treated by radical radiotherapy for variety of tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, glottic larynx, anal canal, cervix, bladder, thyroid gland, and tonsil pillar. Five patients did not develop any significant late reactions (normally sensitive group, NS). The other five developed late complications in different normal tissues and organs that proved to be fatal in one patient (clinically hyper-sensitive group, HS). Fibroblast cultures were established from punch skin biopsy and radiosensitivity in vitro was measured. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was calculated and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: SF2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.38 with a mean of 0.24. The mean SF2 for each of the NS and the HS groups were 0.31 and 0.17, respectively. The non-parametric rank test of Mann-Whitney shows that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts is correlated with late complications in different organs and normal tissues following radiotherapy for variety of tumors. It also lends support to the existence of a common genetic component determining the radiosensitivity of cells targeted by the late effects of ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Patients and Methods: Eighty consecutive patients with 326 melanoma brain metastases receiving SRS in combination with ipilimumab or nivolumab were identified from an institutional database and retrospectively evaluated. Patients started systemic treatment with intravenous nivolumab or ipilimumab within one week of receiving SRS. Nivolumab was given at doses of 3 mg/kg every two weeks. Ipilimumab was administered up to four doses of 10 mg/kg, one every 3 weeks, then patients had a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks, until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint of the study was intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were extracranial PFS, overall survival (OS), and neurological toxicity. Result(s): Eighty patients were analyzed. Forty-five patients received SRS and ipilimumab, and 35 patients received SRS and nivolumab. With a median follow-up of 15 months, the 6-month and 12-month intracranial PFS rates were 69% (95%CI,54-87%) and 42% (95%CI,24-65%) for patients receiving SRS and nivolumab and 48% (95%CI,34-64%) and 17% (95%CI,5-31%) for those treated with SRS and ipilimumab (p = 0.02), respectively. Extracranial PFS and OS were 37 and 78% in SRS and nivolumab group, respectively, and 17 and 68% in SRS and ipilimumab group, respectively, at 12 months. Sub-group analysis showed significantly better intracranial PFS for patients receiving multi-fraction SRS (3 x 9 Gy) compared to single-fraction SRS (70% versus 46% at 6 months, p = 0.01), especially in combination with nivolumab. Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 11 (24%) patients treated with SRS and ipilimumab and 6 (17%) patients who received SRS and nivolumab. Radiation-induced brain necrosis (RN) occurred in 15% of patients. Conclusion(s): Concurrent SRS and ipilimumab or nivolumab show meaningful intracranial activity in patients with either asymptomatic and symptomatic melanoma brain metastases, although a subset of patients may develop symptomatic RN. The combination of nivolumab with SRS is associated with better intracranial control.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded

We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with MPM who received surgery at Hyogo College of Medicine between July 2004 and April 2016. Patients underwent multimodal treatment comprising chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant) and surgery with or without 54 Gy hemithoracic radiotherapy. Patients were grouped into 3 groups according to the surgery intended: Conventional extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 1 (until August 2009); less invasive extrapleural pneumonectomy was intended in Group 2 (after September 2009); pleurectomy/decortication was intended in Group 3 (after September 2012). We included 152 patients (median age 64 [37-71] years; 131 men, 21 women), mostly with epithelioid subtypes (91.4%). Of them, 149 (98.0%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 117 (77.0%) underwent surgery (60 had extrapleural pneumonectomy and 57 had pleurectomy/decortication). Macroscopic complete resection was achieved in 94.9% (111/117), and the mortality rates at 30 and 90 days were 1.7% (2/117) and 3.4% (4/117), respectively. The overall median survival time and progression-free survival for all 152 patients were 34.9 and 17.4 months. The overall median survival time for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 18.5, 41.9, and 43.4 months, respectively. The progression-free survival for Groups 1, 2, and 3 were 12.0, 24.5, and 21.8 months, respectively.

2694,"Indeterminate nodules by the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology in Israel: Frequency, and risk of malignancy after reclassification of follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like features Objective: We aimed to determine the frequency and risk of malignancy (ROM) for indeterminate thyroid nodules, categories III (B3) and IV (B4) of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC), at a large institution in Israel. Additionally, we investigated the impact of redefining follicular neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) as non-malignant on malignancy rates. Method(s): In this retrospective study of all thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed at Tel Aviv-Sourasky Medical Center between January 2013 and December 2015, we assessed ROM for B3 and B4 nodules. Potential risk factors thought to affect a-priori ROM were assessed. Suspected NIFTP lesions were re-examined, and if proven, reclassified as benign. Result(s): 3701 nodules were sampled in 2919 FNAs performed on 2674 patients. B3 reports comprised 7.7% of all nodules (n = 284); B4 represented 3.6% (n = 132). In multivariate logistic regression, male gender, being of former Soviet Union origin, and smoking increased ROM for B3 nodules by a factor of 7.97 (P = 0.002; CI: 2.2-23.4), 9.15 (P = 0.021; CI:1.4-60.0), and 11.0 (P = 0.001; CI 2.8-44.8), respectively. Reclassifying NIFTP decreased ROM from 14% to 12.5% for B3, and from 26.7% to 25% for B4 nodules. NIFTP comprised 9.5% of previously diagnosed resected malignant tumors. Conclusion(s): The relative frequencies of B3 and B4 nodules and their associated malignancy rates were consistent with previous series. Risk factors identified for malignancy may help characterize patients most likely to benefit from surgery. Reclassifying NIFTP had a substantial impact on the ROM in the resected tumors previously diagnosed as malignant.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology",Excluded

From 2006 to 2015, 80 inoperable T1-2N0M0 NSCLC patients were treated with two median dose levels: 60 Gy in six fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 4-8 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 58%-79%) for central lesions (ie within 2 cm of, but not abutting, the proximal bronchial tree; n = 43), and 56 Gy in seven fractions (range, 48-60 Gy in 5-10 fractions) prescribed to the 74% isodose line (range, 60%-80%) for ultra-central lesions (ie abutting the proximal bronchial tree; n = 37) on consecutive days. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), tumor local control rate (LC), and toxicity. Median OS and PFS were 64.47 and 32.10 months (respectively) for ultra-central patients, and not reached for central patients. Median time to local failure, regional failure, and any distant failures for central versus ultra-central lesions were: 27.37 versus 26.07 months, 20.90 versus 12.53 months, and 20.85 versus 15.53 months, respectively, all P <.05. Multivariate analyses showed that tumor categorization (ultra-central) and planning target volume >=52.76 mL were poor prognostic factors of OS, PFS, and LC, respectively (all P <.05). There was one grade 5 toxicity; all other toxicities were grade 1-2. Our results showed that ultra-central tumors have a poor OS, PFS, and LC compared with central patients because of the use of risk-adapted SBRT schedules that allow for equal and favorable toxicity profiles.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This retrospective study evaluated 278 patients treated for STS of the extremities between 2000 and 2006. Of these, 41 patients developed a local recurrence while 247 did not. Tumor characteristics and prognostic outcomes were analyzed. Wilcoxon rank sum test and either chi or Fisher's exact was used to compare variables. Kaplan Meier and Gray's test for cumulative risk were also performed. Results. Patients who had a positive margin were 3.76 times more likely to develop local recurrence when compared to those with negative margins. This corresponds to a 38% risk of local recurrence if the margins were positive after six years vs. 12% if the margins were negative. In patients who underwent a re-excision, the presence or absence of residual disease upon re-excision did not have any bearing on local recurrence (p =0.27). In comparing patients with and without local recurrence, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate and the proportion encountering distant metastasis and death due to sarcoma (p >0.05). Conclusions. Despite advancements in surgery, radiation and imaging, positive margins still occur, and the presence of positive margins following definitive treatment continues to remain as a strong predictor for local recurrence. While local recurrence represents a negative outcome for a patient, its impact on future prognosis is influenced by a variety of factors such as time to local recurrence as well as the tumor's inherent biological characteristics. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
975,"Expression of the Kruppel-type zinc finger gene, ZK7, in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and normal mucosa ZK7 is thought to be involved in the inhibitory effect of vascular endothelial growth factor on apoptotic cell death in human hematopoietic cells. In the present study, we examined the effects of ZK7 on human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). The expression levels of messenger RNA for ZK7 in HNSCC clinical specimens exposed to platinum drugs and/or ionizing radiation were found to be higher than those in non-exposed specimens (P=0.0116). Cell lines examination showed that ZK7 over-expressing cells had low sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin and ionizing radiation. These results suggest that ZK7 may inhibit apoptotic cell death in HNSCC.",Excluded
1593,"Surgery Followed by Hypofractionated Radiosurgery on the Tumor Bed in Oligometastatic Patients With Large Brain Metastases. Results of a Phase 2 Study PURPOSE: This prospective phase II study assessed safety and feasibility of surgery followed by hypofractionated radiosurgery (HSRS) on the tumor bed in oligometastatic patients with single large brain metastases (BMs)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between June 2015 and May 2018, 101 patients were enrolled. Oligometastatic disease was defined by a maximum of 5 extracranial metastatic lesions. HSRS was performed within 1 month of surgery and consisted of 30 Gy in 3 fractions. Local control, occurrence of new BMs, overall survival, and treatment-related toxicities were assessed., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 26 months, local recurrence occurred in 6 patients (5.9%). Six-month, 1-year, and 2-year local control rates were 100%, 98.9% +/- 1.1%, and 85.9% +/- 0.6%, respectively. New BMs occurred in 39 patients (38.6%); median brain distant progression time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year brain distant progression rates were 39 months (95% CI, 19-39 months), 17% +/- 3.7%, 31.4% +/- 4.8%, and 42.5% +/- 5.9%, respectively. At the last observation time, 50 patients (49.5%) were alive and 51 (50.5%) were dead; 10 patients died owing to neurologic causes and 40 as a result of systemic progression. Median overall survival time and 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year overall survival rates were 22 months (95% CI, 20-30 months), 95% +/- 2.1%, 81.9% +/- 3.8%, and 46.6% +/- 6%, respectively. Infratentorial site, residual tumor volume, longer interval time between primary diagnosis and occurrence of BMs, and oligometastatic disease status significantly influenced outcome. Grade 2 to 3 radionecrosis occurred in 26 patients. Neurocognitive functions remained stable or, in some cases, improved., CONCLUSIONS: Surgery followed by HSRS on the tumor bed is a safe and effective approach, affording good brain control with acceptable toxicities. As for extracranial metastatic sites, patients with BMs can benefit from local ablative treatment in the context of an oligometastatic disease. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

2877,"Relationship between body composition and development of diabetes in non-obese Japanese subjects Background : Body mass index (BMI) is a simple and good index to detect individuals with high risk of developing diabetes, though not all obese people develop diabetes. In comparison with populations in USA and Europe, Asian populations have a lower frequency of obesity, and a relatively higher risk of diabetes in non-obese populations. Although epidemiology studies reveal association between body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, very few studies have examined the relationship between body composition and these risk factors in non-obese subjects. Objectives : The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine association of body composition with incidence of diabetes, a CVD risk factor, in non-obese Japanese subjects. Methods : The subjects of this study were 1,137 non-obese subjects without diabetes at baseline (368 males and 769 females, with an average age of 65.2) in the Hiroshima Adult Health Study that consists of atomic bomb survivors and their controls. Body composition was estimated by whole body DXA during the period from 1994 through 1996. We used percentages of trunk, leg, and arm fat in relation to total soft tissue mass as surrogate indicators of body fat distribution, and the ratio of appendicular lean mass/height2 (ALM/H2) as a surrogate indicator of appendicular muscle mass volume. Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose >=126mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or random glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), a history of diabetes diagnosis by a medical institution, or current treatment for diabetes. Results : During the follow-up period lasting until 2011, 133 subjects developed diabetes. In Cox regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, significant negative association was observed between ALM/H2 and diabetes risk in men. Regarding body fat distribution, trunk fat percentage was positively associated with the incidence of diabetes and it was statistically significant only in men. On the other hand, leg fat percentage was significantly and negatively associated with the incidence of diabetes in women. . Significant association between the percentage of arm fat and diabetes risk was not observed in either gender. Conclusions : Among non-obese subjects, we found body composition to be associated with diabetes risk. Therefore, for Japanese people, body composition may be a useful tool for identifying individuals with high risk of developing diabetes.",Excluded

1044,"Suboptimal response to ferrous sulfate in iron-deficient patients taking omeprazole Iron deficiency anemia is commonly encountered in outpatient practice. Gastric acid is one of the important factors for optimum absorption of iron. Proton pump inhibitors are very commonly prescribed medications. One of the debated effects of proton pump inhibitors is on oral iron absorption. Their effect on absorption of oral iron supplementation in iron-deficient patients has not been studied. At the Cooper Hematology Outpatient office, we reviewed charts of iron-deficient anemic patients who were on omeprazole for the last 4 years. Fifty patients having no apparent ongoing blood loss, having other causes of anemia especially that of chronic diseases ruled out, and on omeprazole while starting ferrous sulfate therapy for iron deficiency were selected for chart review. The iron-study results at the start of oral ferrous sulfate therapy and at 3 months follow-up were compared to evaluate the response of ferrous sulfate. The mean hemoglobin change was 0.8 +/- 1.2 g/L. The mean change in ferrtin values was 10.2 +/- 7.8 mug/L. Only 16% of the patients had a normal response to hemoglobin levels (rise of >2 g/dL), and only 40% had a normal response to ferritin levels (rise of >20 mug/dL). The average age of patients having a suboptimal response to both hemoglobin and ferritin was significantly higher compared with that of the patients with an optimal response. Omeprazole and possibly all proton pump inhibitors decrease the absorption of oral iron supplementation. Iron-deficient patients taking proton pump inhibitors may have to be treated with high dose iron therapy for a longer duration or with intravenous iron therapy.",Excluded
2013,"Challenges in the re-irradiation of locally advanced head and neck cancers: outcomes and toxicities Purpose: To retrospectively review outcomes and toxicities for patients with recurrent head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing re-irradiation (re-RT). Method(s): Retrospective review of oncologic outcomes and toxicity data from patients who received head and neck (HN) re-RT with curative intent using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) from 2011 to 2016. Common toxicities were scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4. Treatment outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control (LRC), and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Twenty-one patients with HNC were re-irradiated with curative intent. The median follow-up after re-RT was 27.8 months. The median retreatment dose was 66 Gy (range, 60-70), and the median retreatment volume was 194.1 cm3 (range, 52.4-1375.6). The median LRC, PFS, and OS were 10 months, 8.4 months, and 18.1 months, respectively. Patients treated with surgery as a component of primary HN cancer treatment had significantly worse PFS and OS when retreated compared with those initially treated with chemoradiation alone (p = 0.026 and p = 0.005, respectively). Those with stage IVA/B recurrent disease had worse LRC, PFS, and OS compared with stage II/III disease (p = 0.029, p = 0.049, and p = 0.020 respectively). Acute grade >= 3 toxicity and late grade >= 3 toxicity were 38% and 38%, respectively, with dysphagia being most common (24% acute and 14% late). Conclusion(s): Re-irradiation with IMRT for locally advanced HN recurrences either definitively or after salvage surgery is feasible, but treatment-related toxicity remains significant. Patients who received surgery as a component of their initial treatment and those with more advanced stage disease may be more difficult to salvage with re-irradiation.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2202,"Antegrade wire escalation for chronic total occlusions in coronary arteries: Simple algorithms as a key to success Aims: Antegrade wire escalation (AWE) remains the method of choice for tackling chronic total occlusions (CTOs), especially for lesions with low J-CTO score. To increase the number of operators which treat CTOs and increase AWE success rates, there is a need for a clear, algorithmic approach. We report the results of a simple AWE algorithm with new guidewire technology in coronary CTOs. Method(s): Hundred consecutive CTO lesions selected for AWE as the primary strategy were included in five Benelux centers. The algorithm follows a step-wise increase in guidewire tip load. Lesions were categorized according to the J-CTO score. Primary endpoint was successful guidewire crossing. Result(s): No differences in baseline demographics were present between successful and unsuccessful procedures. Overall, in 75% of the lesions AWE resulted in successful crossing. AWE success rates in easy, intermediate, difficult and very difficult CTOs were 83, 86, 71 and 43%, respectively. 46% could be crossed using a soft guidewire only. An additional success of 34 and 60% could be reached with an intermediate and stiff guidewire, respectively. Adding additional techniques resulted in 88% overall success. Procedure and fluoroscopy times, radiation doses and use of contrast were within highly acceptable ranges (67+/-39min, 27+/-19min, 1.7+/-1.3 Gy, 264+/-123ml). Conclusion(s): The algorithm and new wire technologies led to high success rates. AWE as a standalone procedure is highly successful in J-CTO 0-1. Low- and intermediatevolume CTO operators should try to implement a systematic approach in their CTO procedures, especially for lesions with low J-CTO scores. Adding additional techniques further increases these success rates.© Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2442,"Influence of muscle strength to weight ratio on functional task performance Existing models of muscle deconditioning such as bed rest are expensive and time-consuming. We propose a new model utilizing a weighted suit to manipulate muscle strength, power, or endurance relative to body weight. The aims of the study were to determine as to which muscle measures best predict functional task performance and to determine muscle performance thresholds below which task performance is impaired. Twenty subjects performed seven occupational astronaut tasks (supine and upright seat egress and walk, rise from fall, hatch opening, ladder climb, object carry, and construction board activity), while wearing a suit weighted with 0-120 % of body weight. Models of the relationship between muscle function/body weight and task completion time were developed using fractional polynomial regression and verified with pre- and post-flight astronaut performance data. Spline regression was used to identify muscle function thresholds for each task. Upright seat egress and walk was the most difficult task according to the spline regression analysis thresholds. Thresholds normalized to body weight were 17.8 N/kg for leg press isometric force, 17.6 W/kg for leg press power, 78.8 J/kg for leg press work, 5.9 N/kg isometric knee extension and 1.9 Nm/kg isokinetic knee extension torque. Leg press maximal isometric force/body weight was the most reliable measure for modeling performance of ambulatory tasks. Laboratory-based manipulation of relative strength has promise as an analog for spaceflight-induced loss of muscle function. Muscle performance values normalized to body weight can be used to predict occupational task performance and to establish relevant strength thresholds.",Excluded
372,"Low-dose MDCT and CT enterography of patients with crohn disease: Feasibility of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance of low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in the evaluation of Crohn disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Forty-eight patients (20 men, 28 women; mean age, 33.3 years; range, 17-83 years) with known or suspected Crohn disease who underwent low-dose MDCT and CT enterography with ASIR between December 2008 and December 2009 were included in the study. Twenty-seven patients had previously undergone standard-dose 64-MDCT and CT enterography with filtered back projection (FBP), and those images were used for comparison. The weight-based IV contrast protocol and scan parameters (120 kVp, 5-mm section thickness, 0.5-second rotation, pitch of 1.375, 64 x 0.625 mm detector configuration) were constant for the two techniques except for a higher noise index (x1.3) in the ASIR group. Two blinded readers reviewed 75 randomized MDCT-CT enterographic scans of 48 patients to assess image quality and diagnostic performance in the evaluation of Crohn disease, and the radiation dose for the studies was estimated. RESULTS. All 75 MDCT and CT enterographic scans had acceptable quality for diagnostic interpretation. Findings of Crohn disease were seen on 63 of 75 scans (84%). Low-dose scans in the ASIR group had optimal image quality and were rated comparable to or better than standard-dose FBP images (mean score, 4.2 vs 3.87; p = 0.007). The subjective image noise score (mean, 1.43 vs 1.58; p = 0.2) and objective image noise measurements were lower for ASIR images (p < 0.001). Low-dose studies with ASIR allowed average dose reduction of 34.5% compared with standard-dose scans with FBP (volume CT dose index for ASIR, 7.7 +/- 2.1 mGy; for FBP, 12 +/- 5.5 mGy; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. Low-dose MDCT and CT enterographic studies reconstructed with ASIR were of appropriate quality for confident evaluation of the manifestations of Crohn disease while allowing approximately 34% dose reduction in comparison with FBP technique. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
48,"The relationship between occupational radiation exposure and thyroid nodules Background: Considering that thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer occur more frequently in people chronically exposed to radiation, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of thyroid nodules in a population occupationally exposed to radiation in hospitals of Isfahan, Iran. Material(s) and Method(s): In this case-control study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules in staff members occupationally exposed to radiation was determined by ultrasonography. The results were compared with the results of another study among the adult population of Isfahan which selected by cluster random sampling method. The 2 studied groups were matched according to sex and age. Result(s): The case and control groups included 124 and 471 persons, respectively. The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the case and control groups was 22.6% and 24.6%, respectively (p > 0.05). Although thyroid nodules were significantly more prevalent in females in the control group, no such difference was observed between females and males of the case group (p > 0.05). The number of thyroid nodules (single or multiple) and calcification were not different between the two groups (p > 0.05). In addition, hypoechogenicity of thyroid nodules was not different between the two groups for (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): In our study, there was not any correlation between chronic occupational exposure to low dose of radiation and the risk of developing thyroid nodules.

1917,"16. The fraction of cancer attributable to lifestyle and environmental factors in the UK in 2010 This chapter summarises the results of the preceding sections, which estimate the fraction of cancers occurring in the UK in 2010 that can be attributed to sub-optimal, past exposures of 14 lifestyle and environmental risk factors. For each of 18 cancer types, we present the percentage of cases attributable to one or all of the risk factors considered (tobacco, alcohol, four elements of diet (consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables, fibre, and salt), overweight, lack of physical exercise, occupation, infections, radiation (ionising and solar), use of hormones, and reproductive history (breast feeding)).Exposure to less than optimum levels of the 14 factors was responsible for 42.7% of cancers in the UK in 2010 (45.3% in men, 40.1% in women)-a total of about 134 000 cases.Tobacco smoking is by far the most important risk factor for cancer in the UK, responsible for 60 000 cases (19.4% of all new cancer cases) in 2010. The relative importance of other exposures differs by sex. In men, deficient intake of fruits and vegetables (6.1%), occupational exposures (4.9%) and alcohol consumption (4.6%) are next in importance, while in women, it is overweight and obesity (because of the effect on breast cancer)-responsible for 6.9% of cancers, followed by infectious agents (3.7%).Population- attributable fractions provide a valuable quantitative appraisal of the impact of different factors in cancer causation, and are thus helpful in prioritising cancer control strategies. However, quantifying the likely impact of preventive interventions requires rather complex scenario modelling, including specification of realistically achievable population distributions of risk factors, and the timescale of change, as well as the latent periods between exposure and outcome, and the rate of change following modification in exposure level. © 2011 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved.",Included
2796,"Combined use of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation and iterative reconstruction technique in coronary CT angiography Purpose: To analyze the effect of automatic tube potential selection with tube current modulation (APSCM) and iterative reconstruction on image quality, diagnostic accuracy, and radiation dose at computed tomographic (CT) angiography and compare it with APSCM-only and body mass index (BMI)-based examination protocols. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol. Conclusion(s): The combination of SAFIRE and APSCM at coronary CT angiography significantly improves objective image quality while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and reduced radiation dose. © RSNA, 2013.",Excluded

3186,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded

Both ex vivo and in vivo technologies are available to picture the epidermal thickness (ET). So far, the illustration of the stratum corneum (SC) has not been possible without artifacts. Objective(s): Precision in vivo measurement of the ET and SC, duly considering the impact of location on the body, age, and gender. Method(s): In this pilot study on 20 skin-healthy subjects aged 18-66 years, the ET was imaged by two-photon microscopy (2PM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and the SC by using 2PM at five different body sites. Result(s): On solar-exposed body areas, both the epidermis and SC are thicker compared to solar-protected areas (p < 0.05), the epidermis at the gluteal region being the thickest (p < 0.05). The ET decreases with age (p < 0.05). Males show a thicker epidermis than females (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): 2PM provides a noninvasive method for imaging the epidermis and especially the SC in vivo and is optimally suited for the application of histological criteria.Copyright © 2019 S.

The target volumes in two patients with malignant tumors showed sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis. In the third patient, who had a benign acoustic nerve tumor, neuropathological examination found intratumoral hemorrhage and cyst formation, but no necrosis.

We examined the effect of chemical exposures on cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers at the AREVA NC Pierrelatte facility., METHODS: A cohort of 2,897 uranium processing workers employed for at least 6 months was followed from 1968 through 2006. Exposure to uranium and potentially carcinogenic chemicals was assessed with a plant-specific job-exposure matrix. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for cancers of the lung, lymphohematopoietic system, kidney and bladder, brain and central nervous system (BCNS), and prostate were estimated for each specific chemical exposure, with Cox regression models stratified for sex and calendar period and adjusted for socioeconomic status. Additional adjustments enabled us to examine the effect of co-exposure to uranium and other chemicals., RESULTS: Exposure to aromatic solvents was associated with increased risk of BCNS malignancies after adjustment for other chemicals (HR=6.53, 95% CI=1.14-37.41; n=6) and for other chemicals and uranium (HR=7.26, 95% CI=0.90-58.19) in the annual exposure status model. Selected groups of lymphohematopoietic cancers were found associated with solvent exposure. Inconclusive results were found regarding chromium (VI) exposure, since only 2 workers died from lung cancer among 109 exposed., CONCLUSION: Based on our pilot study, it seemed important to take into account chemical exposures in the analyses of cancer mortality among French uranium processing workers.

Patients and Methods: Sixty-four patients with locally advanced squamous cancers (stage IV, 98%; N2/3, 81%) were treated on an intensive regimen consisting of 5-day (120-hour) infusions of paclitaxel (20 mg/m2/d) and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/d), oral hydroxyurea 500 mg every 12 hours for 11 doses, and radiation 1.5 Gy bid (T-FH2X). Chemoradiation was administered concomitantly on days 1 to 5 of each 14-day cycle. A full treatment course consisted of five cycles during a 10-week period to a total radiation dose of 72 to 75 Gy. Result(s): The median follow-up for the group is 34 months. At 3 years, progression-free survival is 63%, locoregional control is 86%, and systemic control is 79%; overall survival is 60%. Seventeen patients died of recurrent cancer, two died of second primary cancers, and four died of other causes. Side effects observed include anemia (22% required transfusion), leucopenia (34%, grade 3 to 4), and mucositis (84%, grade 3 to 4). Organ preservation principles were maintained. At 1 year posttreatment, 61% of patients had severe xerostomia and 47% had compromised swallowing. There was little disturbance of speech quality in 97% of patients at the same follow-up point. Conclusion(s): T-FH2X is a highly active and tolerable concomitant chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen that induces sustained local tumor control and holds promise for improved survival with organ preservation in high-risk patients. Identification of less toxic therapy and improved distant disease control are needed. T-FH2X should be tested in a randomized trial and compared with a less intensive concomitant regimen that uses once-daily radiation fractionation. © 2001 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",Excluded

Result(s): With a median follow-up of 57 months (range, 2-102 months), 33 patients had developed regional failure, of which, 22 patients encountered recurrence in the irradiation field and only 11 patients (1%) experienced relapse outside the irradiation field. The 5-year overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, regional relapse-free survival, and local relapsefree survival were 80.8%, 82.6%, 96.8%, and 93.2% respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that the N-classification was the only significant prognostic factor for predicting regional relapse-free survival.

138,"Distributed interactive communication in simulated space-dwelling groups This report describes the development and preliminary application of an experimental test bed for modeling human behavior in the context of a computer generated environment to analyze the effects of variations in communication modalities, incentives and stressful conditions. In addition to detailing the methodological development of a simulated task environment that provides for electronic monitoring and recording of individual and group behavior, the initial substantive findings from an experimental analysis of distributed interactive communication in simulated space dwelling groups are described. Crews of three members each (male and female) participated in simulated planetary missions"" based upon a synthetic scenario task that required identification, collection, and analysis of geologic specimens with a range of grade values. The results of these preliminary studies showed clearly that cooperative and productive interactions were maintained between individually isolated and distributed individuals communicating and problem-solving effectively in a computer-generated ""planetary"" environment over extended time intervals without benefit of one another's physical presence. Studies on communication channel constraints confirmed the functional interchangeability between available modalities with the highest degree of interchangeability occurring between Audio and Text modes of communication. The effects of task-related incentives were determined by the conditions under which they were available with Positive Incentives effectively attenuating decrements in performance under stressful time pressure. c2003 Elsevier Ltd.

2361,"Rotational angiography for diagnosis and surgical planning in the management of spinal vascular lesions OBJECT: The management of spinal vascular malformations has undergone significant evolution with the advent of advanced endovascular and angiographic technology. Three-dimensional rotational spinal angiography is an advanced tool that allows the surgeon to gain a better appreciation of the anatomy of these spinal vascular lesions and their relation to surrounding structures. This article describes the use of rotational angiography and 3D reconstructions in the diagnosis and management of spinal vascular malformations., METHODS: The authors present representative cases involving surgical treatment planning for spinal vascular malformations with focus on the utility and technique of rotational spinal angiography. They report the use of rotational spinal angiography for a heterogeneous collection of vascular pathological conditions., RESULTS: Eight patients underwent rotational spinal angiography in addition to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the diagnosis and characterization of various spinal vascular lesions. Postprocessed images were used to characterize the lesion in relation to surrounding bone and to enhance the surgeon's ability to precisely localize and obliterate the abnormality. The reconstructions provided superior anatomical detail compared with traditional DSA. No associated complications from the rotational angiography were noted, and there was no statistically significant difference in the amount of radiation exposure to patients undergoing rotational angiography relative to traditional angiography., CONCLUSIONS: The use of rotational spinal angiography provides a rapid and powerful diagnostic tool, superior to conventional DSA in the diagnosis and preoperative planning of a variety of spinal vascular pathology. A more detailed understanding of the anatomy of such lesions provided by this technique may improve the safety of the surgical approach.",Excluded
2922,"Different outdoor professions have different risks - a cross-sectional study comparing non-melanoma skin cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and mountain guides Background: One of the main risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most common cancer worldwide, is solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This has led to the recognition of NMSC as occupational disease for outdoor workers in several countries. However, outdoor professions are a very heterogeneous group with diverse daily activities and associated UVR exposure. Objective(s): To compare the prevalence of NMSC and associated risk behaviour in different outdoor professions. Method(s): Cross-sectional study among outdoor workers (farmers, gardeners, mountain guides) and indoor workers (office employees) as control group using a paper-based questionnaire on UVR exposure and protective behaviour followed by a skin examination by a dermatologist. Result(s): A total of 563 participants (46.9% women, 46.9 +/- 13.8 years) consisting of 348 outdoor workers (38.8% farmer, 35.3% gardener, 25.9% mountain guides) and 215 indoor workers were included in the study between March and September 2017. NMSC incl. actinic keratosis was diagnosed in 33.3% of mountain guides, 27.4% of farmers, 19.5% of gardeners and in 5.6% of indoor workers. Significant differences were seen between the outdoor professions with mountain guides at highest risk compared to farmers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-5.7). Substantial differences between the professions were also seen in skin cancer screening attendance rates (indoor worker 61.4%, mountain guides 57.8%, farmers 31.9%, gardeners 27.6%), daily UVR exposure during work and protective behaviour such as sunscreen use during work. Conclusion(s): Different outdoor professions have significant different risks for NMSC and show different risk behaviour. Tailoring prevention efforts to different professions based on their individual needs could be the key to lower the global burden of (occupational) NMSC.Copyright © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",Excluded
1833,"The thermal effects of therapeutic lasers with 810 and 904 nm wavelengths on human skin OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of therapeutic infrared class 3B laser irradiation on skin temperature in healthy participants of differing skin color, age, and gender., BACKGROUND: Little is known about the potential thermal effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) irradiation on human skin., METHODS: Skin temperature was measured in 40 healthy volunteers with a thermographic camera at laser irradiated and control (non-irradiated) areas on the skin. Six irradiation doses (2-12 J) were delivered from a 200 mW, 810 nm laser and a 60 mW, 904 nm laser, respectively., RESULTS: Thermal effects of therapeutic LLLT using doses recommended in the World Association for Laser Therapy (WALT) guidelines were insignificant; below 1.5degreeC in light, medium, and dark skin. When higher irradiation doses were used, the 60 mW, 904 nm laser produced significantly (p < 0.01) higher temperatures in dark skin (5.7, SD +/- 1.8degreeC at 12 J) than in light skin, although no participants requested termination of LLLT. However, irradiation with a 200 mW, 810 nm laser induced three to six times more heat in dark skin than in the other skin color groups. Eight of 13 participants with dark skin asked for LLLT to be stopped because of uncomfortable heating. The maximal increase in skin temperature was 22.3degreeC., CONCLUSIONS: The thermal effects of LLLT at doses recommended by WALT-guidelines for musculoskeletal and inflammatory conditions are negligible (<1.5degreeC) in light, medium, and dark skin. However, higher LLLT doses delivered with a strong 3B laser (200 mW) are capable of increasing skin temperature significantly and these photothermal effects may exceed the thermal pain threshold for humans with dark skin color.",Excluded

231,"Randomized trial addressing risk features and time factors of surgery plus radiotherapy in advanced head-and-neck cancer Purpose: A multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma to address (1) the validity of using pathologic risk features, established from a previous study, to determine the need for, and dose of, postoperative radiotherapy (PORT); (2) the impact of accelerating PORT using a concomitant boost schedule; and (3) the importance of the overall combined treatment duration on the treatment outcome. Methods and Materials: Of 288 consecutive patients with advanced disease registered preoperatively, 213 fulfilled the trial criteria and went on to receive therapy predicated on a set of pathologic risk features: no PORT for the low-risk group (n=31); 57.6 Gy during 6.5 weeks for the intermediate-risk group (n=31); and, by random assignment, 63 Gy during 5 weeks (n=76) or 7 weeks (n=75) for the high-risk group. Patients were irradiated with standard techniques appropriate to the site of disease and likely areas of spread. The study end points were locoregional control (LRC), survival, and morbidity. Result(s): Patients with low or intermediate risks had significantly higher LRC and survival rates than those with high-risk features (p=0.003 and p=0.0001, respectively), despite receiving no PORT or lower dose PORT, respectively. For high-risk patients, a trend toward higher LRC and survival rates was noted when PORT was delivered in 5 rather than 7 weeks. A prolonged interval between surgery and PORT in the 7-week schedule was associated with significantly lower LRC (p=0.03) and survival (p=0.01) rates. Consequently, the cumulative duration of combined therapy had a significant impact on the LRC (p=0.005) and survival (p=0.03) rates. A 2-week reduction in the PORT duration by using the concomitant boost technique did not increase the late treatment toxicity. Conclusion(s): This Phase III trial established the power of risk assessment using pathologic features in determining the need for, and dose of, PORT in patients with advanced head-and-neck squamous cell cancer in a prospective, multi-institutional setting. It also revealed the impact of the overall treatment time in the combination of surgery and PORT on the outcome in high-risk patients and showed that PORT acceleration without a reduction in dose by a concomitant boost regimen did not increase the late complication rate. These findings emphasize the importance of coordinated interdisciplinary care in the delivery of combined surgery and RT. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.",Included
879,"Anal cancer treated with radio-chemotherapy: Correlation between length of treatment interruption and outcome Aim: The purpose of this study was the evaluation of the feasibility and outcome of definitive radio-chemotherapy without split-course technique but with individualised short treatment interruption in anal cancer patients. Method(s): Between 1993 and 2008, 101 patients with anal cancer were treated in our institution with definitive radio-chemotherapy with individualised short treatment interruptions. Treatment was halted independent of dose in case of acute grade 3 toxicities and started again until improvement. Short interruption was defined as completing treatment without exceeding six cumulative treatment days beyond a scheduled plan; otherwise, it was defined as prolonged interruption. Result(s): Median overall treatment time was 47 days corresponding to an interruption of six cumulative treatment days. Fifty-one patients (50%) had treatment interruption of >=6 days. No acute grade 4 toxicities were observed. One fatality occurred during treatment due to ileus-like symptoms according to acute grade 5 toxicity. After a median follow-up of 56 months, the 5-year actuarial rates for local control comparing patients with short vs. prolonged treatment interruption were 78% vs. 81% (p=0.904) and, for colostomy-free survival, 83% vs. 85% (p=0.784), respectively.

2812,"Effect of fluoroscopic X-rays combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media on human hematological parameters Introduction: Fluoroscopic X-rays are widely used for examinations around the world. Technicians often use an iodinated radiographic contrast media during fluoroscopic X-ray examinations. Objective(s): This study examined the impact on hematological parameters for human blood and morphology of red blood cells that were exposed to fluoroscopic X-ray combined with iodinated radiographic contrast media, i.e., iopromid, iohexol, and iodixanol. Method(s): Blood samples from male and female subjects were incubated with 5 mgI/mL of iodinated radiographic contrast media for 5 min, then were irradiated using fluoroscopic X-rays (70 kV, 0.8 mA) for 10, 30, and 60 min. Hematological parameters of the blood samples were determined by a clinical service center, and morphology of red blood cells was examined by light microscope. Comparison of mean values of hematological parameters based on the student's t-tests between irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood to each corresponding control blood was performed. Result(s): These data showed no change in the hematological parameters and morphology of red blood cells in irradiated blood alone, iodinated radiographic contrast media-incubated blood alone, and combination-exposed blood in both male and female subjects when compared to control blood at all fluoroscopic X-ray times.

GERD patients were divided into as reflux esophagitis, acid-nonerosive reflux disease (NERD) and weakly acid-NERD groups. Patients with normal esophageal mucosa, normal acid exposure and negative proton pump inhibitor test were enrolled in FH group. EGJ-CI (mmHg.cm) as well as EGJ rest pressure and 4s integrated relaxation pressure (IRP 4s) were measured., RESULTS: Among the 115 patients, 18 were reflux esophagitis [(49.0+/-18.9) years, M:F=10:8], 25 were acid-NERD [(48.7+/-14.4) years, M:F=13:12], 37 were weakly acid-NERD [(52.0+/-14.8) years, M:F=15:22] and 35 were FH [(53.6+/-14.8), M:F=8:27]. No differences of Gerd-Q scores were noticed between the four groups. (1)Negative correlations were demonstrated between EGJ-CI and esophageal acid exposure time (r=-0.283, P=0.002), EGJ-CI and acid reflux events (r=-0.233, P=0.012), EGJ-CI and weakly acid reflux events (r=-0.213, P=0.022), EGJ-CI and non-acid reflux events (r=-0.200, P=0.032). (2)The value of EGJ-CI was significantly higher in FH patients than in the three subgroups of GERD(all P<0.01). EGJ rest pressure of FH group was higher than that of acid-NERD (P<0.01). IRP 4s in acid-NERD group was lower than that of FH and weakly acid-NERD (P<0.05). (3)The area under curve (AUC) of EGJ-CI was higher than that of EGJ-CIT, EGJ rest pressure or IRP 4s(0.686 vs 0.678, 0.641 and 0.578).

Thus it might be used as a metric to reflect the anti-reflux function of EGJ. According to the cut-off value of EGJ-CI 9.74 mmHg.cm, patients with GERD can be sensitively differentiated from patients with FH.",Excluded

450,"V30 as a predictor for radiation-induced hypothyroidism: A dosimetric analysis in patients who received radiotherapy to the neck Introduction: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible predictors of thyroid disorders after neck radiotherapy, with a focus on radiation dose-volume factors. Method(s): Thyroid function was measured in 100 patients who had received radiotherapy to the neck, including the thyroid. All radiation-induced thyroid dysfunctions were determined with an endpoint of abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and thyroxine (fT4) and thyroid peroxidase antibodies and (TPA). The total volume of the thyroid, mean radiation dose to the thyroid (Dmean) and thyroid volume percentage that received radiation doses of 10-50 Gy (V10-V50) were calculated in all patients. The evaluated risk factors for thyroid dysfunction included dose-volume parameters, sex, age, previous surgery, chemotherapy and comorbidity. Result(s): There were 52 patients with hypothyroidism and V30 (p = 0.03), thyroid volume (p = 0.01) and Dmean (p = 0.03) appeared to be correlated with hypothyroidism in univariate analysis. However, there was not association found in multivariate analysis for these factors. Conclusion(s): Thyroid disorders after radiation therapy to the neck still represent a clinically underestimated problem. V30 may be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism when determining an individual patient's treatment. © 2014 Akgun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
1959,"Endocrine function and reproductive impairment in an irradiated population of the lizard Uta stansburiana This study describes gonadal changes in lizards (Uta stansburiana) exposed to chronic low levels of gamma radiation (1.5-10 R/day) under field conditions and attempts to evaluate endocrine involvement in these changes. Reproductive impairment in irradiated males is demonstrated during the breeding season by reduced testes weights and by seminiferous tubules devoid of germ cells. Ultrastructural morphology of Leydig cells, plasma testosterone levels, and developed accessory sex structures indicate normal steroidogenesis in such males; cytology of the pituitary gonadotropes and pituitary gonadotropin content indicate normal gonadotropin levels. These findings suggest that low levels of radiation affect the spermatogenic process directly, rather than through damage to the pituitary. Comparable irradiation causes complete resorption of ovarian tissue in some female Uta. The oviducts are atrophic and the pituitary gonadotropes hyperactive. Resemblance of gonadotropes to those of castrated animals and reduced pituitary hormone content suggest elevated levels of gonadotropin production, probably due to the absence of ovarian steroid feedback in affected animals. The continued mitotic activity of oogonia in adult reptiles and their limited number contribute to the vulnerability of germinal tissue in irradiated female lizards. Destruction of the germ cells is accompanied by resorption of all ovarian tissue including steroidogenic elements. Thus, in females as in males, radiation appears to damage gametogenesis rather than pituitary function.",Excluded
2227,"NOS1-, NOS3-, PIK3CA-, and MAPK pathways in skin following radiation therapy Background: Essential molecular pathways such as the MAPK pathway, NO system, or the influence of PIK3CA as an oncogene are known to regulate fundamental signalling networks. However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs. Additional studies should be carried out to identify possible starting points for therapeutic interventions.Copyright © The Author(s). 2017.",Included

2025,"Preprocedural evaluation and endovascular treatment of iliofemoral artery disease without contrast media for patients with pre-existing renal insufficiency Background: Generally, both the preprocedural evaluation and endovascular therapy (EVT) for lower limb arteries require contrast media that is harmful for patients with chronic renal insufficiency. In the present study these procedures were performed without using nephrotoxic contrast media in patients with preexisting renal insufficiency and iliofemoral artery disease. Methods and Results: The 36 consecutive patients with chronic renal insufficiency underwent preprocedural evaluation with duplex examination, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without contrast media, and plain computed tomography (CT). A total of 51 lesions were treated using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) without contrast media. The overall technical success was 100% without any complications. Pre- and postprocedural ankle - brachial indices changed from 0.59+/-0.23 to 0.92+/-0.14. The mean serum creatinine concentration before and after treatment, and 3 months after treatment did not change (2.1+/-1.4, 2.0+/-1.4, and 2.1+/-1.6mg/dl, respectively). The overall 3-month survival rate and limb salvage rate was 100%.

Iterative reconstruction was used in all patients. For image quality assessment, CTA images were evaluated on a three-point scale and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated and compared. Furthermore, computed tomography (CT) dose index was recorded., RESULTS: Mean CT values and noise levels were higher in group A compared to group B (all P < .001), whereas SNR and CNR were lower than those in group B (all P < .001). Furthermore, the image quality of the aorta at the level of the diaphragm was lower in group A than that in group B (P < .05). However, image quality was graded as diagnostic in all patients, and motion artifacts of the aortic arch were significantly decreased in group A (P <.05).

1548,"CT Angiography in the Lower Extremity Peripheral Artery Disease Feasibility of an Ultra-Low Volume Contrast Media Protocol Purpose: The ALARA principle is not only relevant for effective dose (ED) reduction, but also applicable for contrast media (CM) management. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate the feasibility of an ultra-low CM protocol in the assessment of peripheral artery disease (PAD). Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty PAD patients were scanned on third-generation dual-source computed tomography, from diaphragm to the forefoot, as follows: tube voltage: 70 kV, reference effective tube current: 90 mAs, collimation: 192 x 2 x 0.6 mm, with individualized acquisition timing. The protocol ED (mSv) was quantified with dedicated software. CM protocol consisted of 15 ml test bolus and 30 ml main bolus (300 mgI/ml) injected at 5 ml/s, followed by a 40 ml saline chaser at the same flow rate. Aorto-popliteal bolus transit time was used to calculate the overall acquisition time and delay. Objective (hounsfield units-HU; contrast-to-noise ratio-CNR) and subjective image quality (four-point Likert score) were assessed at different anatomical regions from the aorta down to the forefoot. Result(s): Mean attenuation values were exceeding 250 HU from aorta down to the anterior tibial artery with CNR < 13.

2706,"Effect of Doxepin Mouthwash or Diphenhydramine-Lidocaine-Antacid Mouthwash vs Placebo on Radiotherapy-Related Oral Mucositis Pain: The Alliance A221304 Randomized Clinical Trial Importance: Oral mucositis causes substantial morbidity during head and neck radiotherapy. In a randomized study, doxepin mouthwash was shown to reduce oral mucositis-related pain. A common mouthwash comprising diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid is also widely used., Objective: To evaluate the effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis-related pain., Design, Setting, and Participants: A phase 3 randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, to May 16, 2016, at 30 US institutions and included 275 patients who underwent definitive head and neck radiotherapy, had an oral mucositis pain score of 4 points or greater (scale, 0-10), and were followed up for a maximum of 28 days., Interventions: Ninety-two patients were randomized to doxepin mouthwash (25 mg/5 mL water); 91 patients to diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid; and 92 patients to placebo., Main Outcome and Measures: The primary end point was total oral mucositis pain reduction (defined by the area under the curve and adjusted for baseline pain score) during the 4 hours after a single dose of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash compared with a single dose of placebo. The minimal clinically important difference was a 3.5-point change. The secondary end points included drowsiness, unpleasant taste, and stinging or burning. All scales ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst)., Results: Among the 275 patients randomized (median age, 61 years; 58 [21%] women), 227 (83%) completed treatment per protocol. Mucositis pain during the first 4 hours decreased by 11.6 points in the doxepin mouthwash group, by 11.7 points in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group, and by 8.7 points in the placebo group. The between-group difference was 2.9 points (95% CI, 0.2-6.0; P = .02) for doxepin mouthwash vs placebo and 3.0 points (95% CI, 0.1-5.9; P = .004) for diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo. More drowsiness was reported with doxepin mouthwash vs placebo (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-4.0]; P = .03), unpleasant taste (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-3.0]; P = .002), and stinging or burning (by 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.5-5.0]; P < .001). Maximum grade 3 adverse events for the doxepin mouthwash occurred in 3 patients (4%); diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, 3 (4%); and placebo, 2 (2%). Fatigue was reported by 5 patients (6%) in the doxepin mouthwash group and no patients in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group., Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, the use of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo significantly reduced oral mucositis pain during the first 4 hours after administration; however, the effect size was less than the minimal clinically important difference. Further research is needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety for both mouthwashes., Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02229539.",Excluded
2505,"Management of extended radionecrosis in the pelvic area with repeated surgical debridement and omental transposition Extended radionecrosis in the pelvic area is a disaster occurring in a minority of patients treated with radiotherapy. Extensive excisional procedures, including pelvic exenteration, have been recommended, but carry high morbidity and mortality rates. Alternative treatment strategies are needed to improve survival and increase the quality of life in these patients. We retrospectively analysed the charts of eight patients treated for radionecrosis in the pelvic area between 1985 and 1991. During this period deviatory procedures, repeated but limited debridement and the early incorporation of an omental flap in the ischemic area were used in an attempt to avoid exenteration, but effectively stop further progression of infection and necrosis. The patients underwent a median of five surgical interventions (range: 2 to 21) for 10 sites of radionecrosis. The total of 61 procedures consisted of debridement (29), omental pedicle grafting (6), deviation of urinary tract (3) or intestinal tract (4) and including procedures due to complications (21). They were hospitalized for a median duration of 95 days (range 43-155) divided over several admissions (median 3, range 2-8). One patient died of sepsis during treatment. Complete recovery was achieved in all surviving patients with a median of 12 months (range: 9 to 20 months) after initial surgery. Early surgery, the limited extent of the procedures and omental transposition were the main components of our approach. We conclude that this approach has an acceptable morbidity and mortality rate, while a relatively good quality of life is achieved.",Excluded
3081,"Validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection following adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) The effect of preoperative radio chemotherapy on lymphatic drainage and intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection has yet not been investigated. In this study, we study 13 patients with SCC. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging of the patients was performed using SPECT-CT. Special care was taken to use identical injection sites for both studies. Imaging comprised planar and SPECT, iterative reconstruction and were viewed with the co-registered CT image. The results were validated by comparison with the histological results of intraoperative gamma probe detection and histology of the completed neck dissection. Identical SLNs were found in 6/13 patients. In 2/13 cases SLN biopsies were false-negative. In 4/13 patients preoperative SLN imaging identified more/additional nodes than the initial imaging, whereas fewer nodes were seen in 3/13 patients. Neither the primary tumor site nor the TNM stage was predictive for changes in the lymphatic drainage pattern. No constant effect of irradiation could be demonstrated. Preoperative radio chemotherapy has an unpredictable influence on the lymphatic drainage pattern in HNSCC. Consequently, the intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection after radio chemotherapy does not reveal the SLN of carcinogenesis. Thus, we advise fused functional/anatomical imaging (SPECT-CT) before and after radiochemotherapy if the SLN concept is utilized in HNSCC.",Excluded
1743,"Standard-, Reduced-, and No-Dose Thin-Section Radiologic Examinations: Comparison of Capability for Nodule Detection and Nodule Type Assessment in Patients Suspected of Having Pulmonary Nodules Purpose To compare the capability of pulmonary thin-section magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with ultrashort echo time (UTE) with that of standard- and reduced-dose thin-section computed tomography (CT) in nodule detection and evaluation of nodule type. Materials and Methods The institutional review board approved this study, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Standard- and reduced-dose chest CT (60 and 250 mA) and MR imaging with UTE were used to examine 52 patients; 29 were men (mean age, 66.4 years +/- 7.3 [standard deviation]; age range, 48-79 years) and 23 were women (mean age, 64.8 years +/- 10.1; age range, 42-83 years). Probability of nodule presence was assessed for all methods with a five-point visual scoring system. All nodules were then classified as missed, ground-glass, part-solid, or solid nodules. To compare nodule detection capability of the three methods, consensus for performances was rated by using jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis, and kappa analysis was used to compare intermethod agreement for nodule type classification. Results There was no significant difference (F = 0.70, P = .59) in figure of merit between methods (standard-dose CT, 0.86; reduced-dose CT, 0.84; MR imaging with UTE, 0.86). There was no significant difference in sensitivity between methods (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, P = .50; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P = .50; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, P >.99). Intermethod agreement was excellent (standard-dose CT vs reduced-dose CT, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; standard-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.98, P < .001; reduced-dose CT vs MR imaging with UTE, kappa = 0.99, P < .001). Conclusion Pulmonary thin-section MR imaging with UTE was useful in nodule detection and evaluation of nodule type, and it is considered at least as efficacious as standard- or reduced-dose thin-section CT. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
3207,"Radiation dose considerations in the palliative treatment of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas Treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer with high-dose radiotherapy has not been curative, and can be difficult to tolerate. We decided to compare retrospectively the outcomes of patients treated concurrently with 5-fluorouracil and either 30 Gy or more than 30 Gy of radiation. From December 1993 through May 2001, 107 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas had been treated with palliative chemoradiation. Eighty-six patients had received a prescribed dose of 30 Gy and 50.4 Gy had been prescribed in 18 patients. Two of these patients were unable to complete the full dose of radiotherapy due to toxicity, and 3 received intraoperative radiotherapy boost (20 Gy). Three additional patients received a prescribed dose of 33 Gy, 36 Gy, and 52.2 Gy, respectively. These patients were grouped together (n = 21, median 50.4 Gy). All patients had received concurrent protracted venous infusions of 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/m Monday through Friday). The median survival time was not affected significantly by a higher radiotherapy dose (8 months for the 30 Gy group versus 9 months for the group receiving higher doses; P = 0.64). The 6-month actuarial progression rates were 45% versus 50% (P = 0.90) for local disease progression, and 54% versus 50% (P = 0.94) for distant metastasis for the 30 Gy and the higher dose groups, respectively. Ten of the 86 patients (12%) who had received 30 Gy were hospitalized for treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicity (grade 3) versus 6 of the 21 (29%) patients given higher doses (P = 0.05). Compared with higher doses given over 5 to 6 weeks, chemoradiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions in 2 weeks with concurrent infusional 5-FU) results in a similar median survival, and local disease progression rates in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer apparently do not substantially improve local disease control or median survival time. Because higher doses of radiotherapy can lead to increased acute treatment-related morbidity, we recommend using 30 Gy in 10 fractions unless the patient is part of a prospective study evaluating novel biologic or cytotoxic radiosensitizers.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) as an alternative with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in ASCC setting. Method(s): We retrospectively screened all patients with stage I-IV ASCC from January 2010 to June 2019. The records of patients who received definitive chemoradiation with cisplatin/capecitabine (XP) and IMRT were collected and analyzed. Result(s): The first patient was treated with XP in 2017, so totally 11 patients were included in our study from January 2017 to June 2019. All patients have experienced clinical complete response (cCR). After a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 18-39 months), no patient had local recurrence or distant metastasis. Two-year colostomy-free survival (CFS) and two-year disease-free survival (DFS) were both 100%. The median overall survival (OS) has not reached. Grade 3 acute toxicities included leukopenia (1, 9.1%), neutropenia (2, 18.2%) and thrombocytopenia (2, 18.2%). No grade 4 acute adverse events occurred. Conclusion(s): In our study, cisplatin/capecitabine combined with IMRT was safe in ASCC patients, with favorable efficacy as an alternative, and is expected to be explored in study with larger sample.Copyright © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Excluded
781,"Cognitive and radiological effects of radiotherapy in patients with low-grade glioma: long-term follow-up BACKGROUND: Our previous study on cognitive functioning among 195 patients with low-grade glioma (LGG) a mean of 6 years after diagnosis suggested that the tumour itself, rather than the radiotherapy used to treat it, has the most deleterious effect on cognitive functioning; only high fraction dose radiotherapy (>2 Gy) resulted in significant added cognitive deterioration. The present study assesses the radiological and cognitive abnormalities in survivors of LGG at a mean of 12 years after first diagnosis., METHODS: Patients who have had stable disease since the first assessment were invited for follow-up cognitive assessment (letter-digit substitution test, concept shifting test, Stroop colour-word test, visual verbal learning test, memory comparison test, and categoric word fluency). Compound scores in six cognitive domains (attention, executive functioning, verbal memory, working memory, psychomotor functioning, and information processing speed) were calculated to detect differences between patients who had radiotherapy and patients who did not have radiotherapy. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were rated on MRI scans., FINDINGS: 65 patients completed neuropsychological follow-up at a mean of 12 years (range 6-28 years). 32 (49%) patients had received radiotherapy (three had fraction doses >2 Gy). The patients who had radiotherapy had more deficits that affected attentional functioning at the second follow-up, regardless of fraction dose, than those who did not have radiotherapy (-1.6 [SD 2.4] vs -0.1 [1.3], p=0.003; mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.5-2.4). The patients who had radiotherapy also did worse in measures of executive functioning (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.5 [1.2], p=0.03; mean difference 1.5, 0.2-2.9) and information processing speed (-2.0 [3.7] vs -0.6 [1.5], p=0.05; mean difference 0.8, 0.009-1.6]) between the two assessments. Furthermore, attentional functioning deteriorated significantly between the first and second assessments in patients who had radiotherapy (p=0.25). In total, 17 (53%) patients who had radiotherapy developed cognitive disabilities deficits in at least five of 18 neuropsychological test parameters compared with four (27%) patients who were radiotherapy naive. White-matter hyperintensities and global cortical atrophy were associated with worse cognitive functioning in several domains., INTERPRETATION: Long-term survivors of LGG who did not have radiotherapy had stable radiological and cognitive status. By contrast, patients with low-grade glioma who received radiotherapy showed a progressive decline in attentional functioning, even those who received fraction doses that are regarded as safe (</=2 Gy). These cognitive deficits are associated with radiological abnormalities. Our results suggest that the risk of long-term cognitive and radiological compromise that is associated with radiotherapy should be considered when treatment is planned., FUNDING: Kaptein Fonds; Schering Plough.",Included

2823,"Intraoperative electron radiation therapy as an important treatment modality in retroperitoneal sarcoma Background: Local recurrence (LR) rates in patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma (RPS) are high, ranging from 40% to 80%, with no definitive studies describing the best way to administer radiation. Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy (IOERT) provides a theoretical advantage for access to the tumor bed with reduced toxicity to surrounding structures. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of IOERT in high-risk patients. Method(s): An institutional review board approved, single institution sarcoma database was queried to identify patients who received IOERT for treatment of RPS from 2/2001 to 1/2009. Data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression, and Fisher Exact tests. Result(s): Eighteen patients (median age 51 y, 25-76 y) underwent tumor resection with IOERT (median dose 1250 cGy) for primary (n = 13) and recurrent (n = 5) RPS. Seventeen patients received neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Eight high-grade and 10 low-grade tumors were identified. Median tumor size was 15 cm. Four patients died and two in the perioperative period. Median follow-up of survivors was 3.6 y. Five patients (31%) developed an LR in the irradiated field. Three patients with primary disease (25%) and two (50%) with recurrent disease developed an LR (P = 0.5). Four patients with high-grade tumors (57%) and one with a low-grade tumor (11%) developed an LR (P = 0.1). The 2- and 5-y OS rates were 100% and 72%. Two- and 5-y LR rates were 13% and 36%.

Dynamic 64-detector-row CT and balanced steady-state free precession-based non-contrast-enhanced 3-T MR imaging were performed. RAV visualization based on a four-point score was documented. Both anatomical location and variation on cross-sectional imaging were evaluated, and the findings were compared with catheter venography as the gold standard., RESULTS: The RAV was visualized in 93.2% by CT and 84.8% by MR imaging (p = 0.02). Positive predictive values of RAV visualization were 100% for CT and 95.2% for MR imaging. Imaging score was significantly higher in CT than MR imaging (p < 0.01). The RAV formed a common trunk with an accessory hepatic vein in 16% of patients. The RAV orifice level on cross-sectional imaging was concordant with catheter venography within the range of 1/3 vertebral height in >70% of subjects. Success rate of AVS was 99.2%., CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT is a reliable way to map the RAV prior to AVS. Non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging is an alternative when there is a risk of complication from contrast media or radiation exposure., KEY POINTS: Dynamic CT and non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging detect the right adrenal vein (RAV). Dynamic CT can visualize the RAV more than non-contrast-enhanced MR imaging. Mapping the RAV helps to achieve successful adrenal venous sampling.

Latent, immediate-early, and early gene replicative viral transcripts were detected in samples from six astronauts who flew on short-duration Shuttle missions, whereas viral gene transcription was mostly absent in samples from 24 healthy donors. Samples from six astronauts who flew on long-duration ISS missions were characterized by expanded expression of latent, immediate-early, and early gene transcripts and new onset expression of late replicative transcription upon return to Earth. These data indicate that EBV-infected cells are no longer expressing the restricted set of viral genes that characterize latency but are expressing latent and lytic gene transcripts.

198,"Long-term outcomes after radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is the principal alternative to microsurgical resection for acoustic neuromas (vestibular schwannomas). The goals of radiosurgery are the long-term prevention of tumor growth, maintenance of neurologic function, and prevention of new neurologic deficits. Although acceptable short-term outcomes have been reported, long-term outcomes have not been well documented., METHODS: We evaluated 162 consecutive patients who underwent radiosurgery for acoustic neuromas between 1987 and 1992 by means of serial imaging tests, clinical evaluations, and a survey between 5 and 10 years after the procedure. The average dose of radiation to the tumor margin was 16 Gy, and the mean transverse diameter of the tumor was 22 mm (range, 8 to 39). Resection had been performed previously in 42 patients (26 percent); in 13 patients the tumor represented a recurrence of disease after a previous total resection. Facial function was normal in 76 percent of the patients before radiosurgery, and 20 percent had useful hearing., RESULTS: The rate of tumor control (with no resection required) was 98 percent. One hundred tumors (62 percent) became smaller, 53 (33 percent) remained unchanged in size, and 9 (6 percent) became slightly larger. Resection was performed in four patients (2 percent) within four years after radiosurgery. Normal facial function was preserved in 79 percent of the patients after five years (House-Brackmann grade 1), and normal trigeminal function was preserved in 73 percent. Fifty-one percent of the patients had no change in hearing ability. No new neurologic deficits appeared more than 28 months after radiosurgery. An outcomes questionnaire was returned by 115 patients (77 percent of the 149 patients still living). Fifty-four of these patients (47 percent) were employed at the time of radiosurgery, and 37 (69 percent) remained so. Radiosurgery was believed to have been successful by all 30 patients who had undergone surgery previously and by 81 (95 percent) of the 85 who had not. Thirty-six of the 115 patients (31 percent) described at least one complication, which resolved in 56 percent of those cases., CONCLUSIONS: Radiosurgery can provide long-term control of acoustic neuromas while preserving neurologic function.",Included
1707,"Low contrast and radiation dose coronary CT angiography using a 320-row system and a refined contrast injection and timing method BACKGROUND: Among CT scanners, 320-row instruments feature decreased photon energy and yield strong contrast enhancement. Consequently, the contrast medium (CM) dose can be reduced. The results of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CCTA) performed on 320-row scanners have not been adequately assessed., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of a low-contrast-dose protocol on the image quality of CCTA using 80 kVp tube voltage, iterative reconstruction (IR), and a 320-row scanner., METHODS: We randomly assigned 90 patients (mean body weight, 56.5 +/- 11.0 kg) to 1 of 3 CCTA protocols. Under protocol A, 30 were scanned using a conventional 120-kVp protocol and a standard CM dose (280 mg iodine/kg body weight [mgI/kg]). Another 30 underwent scanning at 80 kVp with a 25% CM dose reduction (210 mgI/kg; protocol B). Under protocol C, the remaining 30 patients were scanned at 80 kVp with a 50% CM dose reduction (140 mgI/kg). The 120 and 80 kVp images were processed with IR. Images obtained under the 3 protocols were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis., RESULTS: The amount of CM used in protocol A, B, and C was 43.6 +/- 10.1, 30.3 +/- 4.4, and 21.0 +/- 4.0 mL, respectively. Mean CT attenuation of the coronary arteries tended to be higher under protocol B than the other 2 protocols. The contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher under protocol B. The mean visual scores were significantly higher for protocols A and B than protocol C. The mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower under the 80-kVp protocol., CONCLUSION: With a 320-row scanner and our refined CM injection and timing protocol, it is technically feasible to obtain sufficient vascular enhancement with a reduction in the CM and/or radiation dose at 80-kVp CCTA with IR.

3,"New radiosensitization treatment (KORTUC-SC) for chemo-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis Purpose/Objective: Linear accelerator-based radiotherapy has little effect on most of locally-advanced neoplasmas that have grown to several centimeters or more. Such tumors contain numerous hypoxic cancer cells and/or large amounts of anti-oxidative enzymes, and are therefore resistant to low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation such as X-rays and electrons from linear accelerators (Linac). We have developed a new radiosensitizer containing hydrogen peroxide & sodium hyaluronate for topical tumor injection for various types of tumors which are not superficially exposed, and the method was named 'KORTUC II'. Safety and effectiveness of the method have already been successfully performed by our clinical trials for patients with unresectable and/or recurrent neoplasms. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of KORTUC II specifically for patients with chemotherapy-resistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis, and the method was named as KORTUC-SC (KORTUC for supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis). For these lesions, curative resection is impossible because of the direct invasion of neoplasms to surrounding cervical great vessels. Therefore new strategies for better local control have been needed. Material(s) and Method(s): This study was performed at Kochi Medical School Hospital between September 2006 and March 2010. Twelve patients (2 men,10 women) with chemotherapy-resistant supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were enrolled into the study after providing fully informed written consent. All the patients underwent PET-CT examinations prior to and at 3 ~ 6 months after KORTUC-SC. We compared these two examination results. Patients were 58 to 77 years old (average age was 65).The radiotherapy regimen was 4 Gy/time, 3 times/week, for 4 weeks, and total dose was 48 Gy. The appropriate energy level of electron beams was selected for individual patients in terms of depth of the target lesion. The injection of 3 to 6 ml of the agent was started from the 5th session of radiotherapy, and was performed twice a week under ultrasonographic guidance. Result(s): The numbers of the patients were 12. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by the FDG-PET performed prior to and following the KORTUC-SC treatment. Treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects. Of the 12 patients, 6 (50%) showed complete response (CR), 1 (8.3%) showed partial response (PR), 3 (25%) showed stable disease(SD), and another 2 (16.6%) showed progressive disease (PD). Overall survival rate was 83% at 1 year (10/12 patients) and 75% at 2 years (9/12 patients). The mean duration of follow-up at the end of February 2011 was 35.1 months. Conclusion(s): Based on the findings of FDG-PET study, remarkable therapeutic effects of the KORTUC II treatment for chemotherapyresistant supra-clavicular lymph nodes metastasis (KORTUC-SC) were clearly identified. The treatment was well tolerated, with minimal adverse effects such as local pain at the injection site. The treatment outcomes were satisfactory and the adverse events were within the permissible range. This therapy is much less expensive than molecular-targeted therapies in current use, such as Cetuximab. Some well designed prospective randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of KORTUC-SC.",Excluded

However, there has been little information on dosimetric parameters for radiotherapy planning in the aspect of RILF. The features of RILF related with dosimetric parameters were evaluated., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma who underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT) without adjuvant chemotherapy were analyzed. The degree of lung fibrosis was estimated by fibrosis volume and the dosimetric parameters were calculated from the plan of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy., RESULTS: The fibrosis volume and V-dose as dosimetric parameters showed significant correlation and the correlation coefficient ranged from 0.602 to 0.683 (P<0.01). The degree of the correlation line was steeper as the dose increase and threshold dose was not found. Mean lung dose (MLD) showed strong correlation with fibrosis volume (correlation coefficient = 0.726, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The fibrosis volume is continuously increased with V-dose as the reference dose increases. MLD is useful as a single parameter for comparing rival plans in the aspect of RILF. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

FLT is a nucleoside analog that enters cells and is phosphorylated by human thymidine kinase 1, but the 3' substitution prevents further incorporation into DNA. We estimated the radiation dosimetry for this tracer from data gathered in patient studies., METHODS: Time-dependent tissue concentrations of radioactivity were determined from blood samples and PET images of 18 patients after intravenous injection of (18)F-FLT. Radiation-absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRD Committee methods, taking into account variations that were based on the distribution of activities observed in the individual patients. Effective dose equivalent (EDE) was calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 tissue weighting factors for the standard man and woman., RESULTS: For a single bladder voiding at 6 h after (18)F-FLT injection, the (18)F-FLT EDE (mean +/- SD) was 0.028 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (103 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard male patient and 0.033 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (121 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard female patient. The organ that received the highest dose was the bladder (male, 0.179 mGy/MBq [662 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.174 mGy/MBq [646 mrad/mCi]), followed by the liver (male, 0.045 mGy/MBq [167 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.064 mGy/MBq [238 mrad/mCi]), the kidneys (male, 0.035 mGy/MBq [131 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.042 mGy/MBq [155 mrad/mCi]), and the bone marrow (male, 0.024 mGy/MBq [89 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.033 mGy/MBq [122 mrad/mCi])., CONCLUSION: Organ dose estimates for (18)F-FLT are comparable to those associated with other commonly performed nuclear medicine tests, and the potential radiation risks associated with (18)F-FLT PET imaging are within accepted limits.",Excluded
2533,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005) OBJECTIVE: To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort., METHODS: We analysed 65,719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors., RESULTS: Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.

3261,"X-ray-induced sterility in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) and male longevity following irradiation The mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) is a potent vector of several arboviral diseases, most notably chikungunya and dengue fever. In the context of the sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterilization of the male mosquitoes before their release can be achieved by gamma-ray irradiation. As gamma-ray irradiators are becoming increasingly problematic to purchase and transport, the suitability of an X-ray irradiator as an alternative for the sterilization of Ae. albopictus males was studied. The sterilization of up to 200,000 pupae at one time can be achieved with relative ease, and the sterility results obtained were comparable with those achieved by gamma irradiation, where 99% sterility is induced with a dose of 40 Gy. A significant reduction of longevity was observed in the latter stages of the males' life after irradiation treatments, especially at doses > 40 Gy, which is consistent with the negative effects on longevity induced by similar radiation doses using gamma rays. Females irradiated at 40 Gy were not only 100% sterile, but also failed to oviposit entirely, i.e., all of the females laid 0 eggs. Overall, it was found that the X-ray irradiator is generally suitable for the sterilization process for sterile insect technique programs, as it showed a high processing capacity, practicality, high effectiveness, and reproducibility.",Excluded
2403,"Total body irradiation with or without lung shielding for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation From June 1986 to June 1990, 64 patients with leukaemia (25 acute myelogenous leukaemia, 21 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and 18 chronic myeloid leukaemia) undergoing marrow transplantation were randomized to receive cyclophosphamide (CY) and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) without lung shielding (n = 33) or CY and fractionated TBI with lung shielding (n = 31, control group) as conditioning. Patients conditioned with TBI without lung shielding received a significantly higher total lung dose compared with the control group (p less than 0.0001). The 3-year leukaemia-free survival for patients receiving TBI without lung shielding is 54 +/- 18% versus 51 +/- 18% for patients receiving TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). There was no significant difference in the probability of leukaemia relapse (22 +/- 18% for TBI without lung shielding versus 24 +/- 18% for control group; p = ns). The probability of interstitial pneumonitis is 15 +/- 14% for TBI without lung shielding and 5 +/- 5% for TBI with lung shielding (p = ns). A higher incidence of lung fungal infection (15 versus 3%) and interstitial pneumonitis (12 versus 3%) has been documented in patients receiving TBI without lung shielding compared with the control group. The results indicate that higher radiation dose to the lung did not increase antileukaemic efficacy of TBI but seemed to be associated with the increased pulmonary toxicity.",Excluded
1065,"Functional changes cardiovascular: normobaric activity and microgravity in young healthy human subjects BACKGROUND: The cardiovascular system works to maintain homeostasis through a series of adaptive responses to physiological requirements. Different self-regulatory mechanism prevent the effects induced by hydrostatic pressure changes on oncotic pressure caused by postural changes. Gravity exerts a strong influence on the postural changes with implications on the cardiovascular system. In orbit, gravity (+Gz) is responsible of mass redistribution of circulating blood flow. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the adaptive responses of cardiovascular system to postural changes with and without the use of the Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP). We considered that pressure changes that occur in human body in orbit can be simulated experimentally with use of Tilt-Test (Clino/ortho; Clino/head-down; head-down/ortho). This investigation could be useful for studying the influence on astronauts of long flights., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied in 12 months, 30 young healthy volunteers (20 males, 10 female) during postural change tests. In the first evaluation they were submitted to tilt-test for 40 minutes, remaining in head-up +60 degrees (this state corresponds to a kind of gravitational stress +Gz) and in head-down to -30 degrees (-Gz) for 20 minutes. During the second assessment (after 5 +/- 1 days) all volunteers wear a device that simulate a state of LBNP at -20 mmHg. Afterwards, they were processed to 20 minutes in Head Down -8 degrees and after 2 hours of rest to 20 minutes at -15 degrees. Volunteers were monitored measuring blood pressure, heart rate and by Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE)., RESULTS: Collected data were elaborated by a statistical analysis. We observed during orthostatic position for 40 min (+60 degrees) without LBNP, lower diameters and volumes of left and right ventricular (p < 0.05) and an increase in heart rate in comparison with the baseline conditions in clinostatism. Despite the reduction of preload volume, the mean value of cardiac output does not vary significantly. In Trendelemburg (-15 degrees) data show a non-significant variation (p > 0.05) of left and right ventricular diameters and volumes, while cardiac output and systolic blood pressure varies significantly (p < 0.05) compared to clinostatic and orthostatic position. With LBNP in head down to -8 degrees and -15 degrees, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, ventricular volumes and cardiac output were unchanged if compared to values obtained in clinostatism with and without LBNP. If compared to -30 degrees in Trendelemburg without LBNP, data reached statistical significance (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular system and the autonomic nervous system, respond to postural changes and to volemia alterations, maintaining the physiological cardiac output, in order to preserve the metabolic requirements of body.",Excluded
3147,"Efficacy of X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy on brain metastases and prognostic analysis Background and Objective: X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is one of the effective treatments for brain metastases (BM). This study was to evaluate the efficacy of SRT on BM, and investigate prognostic factors. Method(s): Between July 1999 and December 2004, a total of 122 Intracranial lesions In 78 patients with BM were treated using SRT in our Center. Forty-nine patients had a solitary lesion and 29 had multiple (2-6) lesions. The median SRT dose was 15 Gy (11-24 Gy) in single fraction for 38 lesions, and 24 Gy (11-40 Gy) in 2-6 fractions for 84 lesions. SRT was combined with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30-40 Gy for 39 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by the log-rank test and Cox model, respectively. Result(s): The median survival time was 12.9 months (1.7-77.4 months). The 1-year intracranial PFS rate was 87.4%. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 53.9% and 25.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the 1-year OS rates were higher In the patients with pretreatment KPS of s= 70, extracranial lesions controlled, or SRT combined with WBRT than in those with KPS of < 70 (60.7% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.002), extracranial lesions uncontrolled (69% vs. 44.9%, P = 0.005), or SRT alone (64.1% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.03). The benefit of treating with WBRT in combination was mainly achieved in the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or with more than one Intracranial lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that KPS score and status of extracranial lesions were independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): SRT is an effective and safe modality for BM. SRT combined with WBRT may prolong the survival time of the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or multiple Intracranial lesions. Independent prognostic factors for OS are KPS score and status of extracranial lesions.",Excluded
3120,"Relationship of Th17/treg cells and radiation pneumonia in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background/Aim: Radiation pneumonia is a main side-effect that has limited the clinical usage of radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. T helper cells 17 (Th 17) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases. The balance between Treg and Th17 cells is a key factor in the progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Whether Tregs and Th17 cells are predictive factors of radiation pneumonia has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationships of Treg/Th17 cells and radiation pneumonia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radical and palliative radiotherapy were enrolled. The levels of Th17 and Treg cells in the blood of patients were detected using flow cytometry at the time point of pre-radiotherapy, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th week from the start of radiation and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonia was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's acute radiation pneumonia standards, with the endpoint being grade 2 or above radiation pneumonia. Result(s): There were 24 cases of radiation pneumonia in 148 cases of locally advanced esophageal cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy. Th17 cells increased and, in contrast, Treg cells decreased in the radiation pneumonia group. The change in the ratio of Th17/Treg was more pronounced and the difference was statistically significant from the 5th week after irradiation compared to patients with no radiation pneumonia (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in dosimetric parameters, including V5, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) and clinical factors, such as gender, age, smoking history, history of surgery and chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The ratio of Th17/Treg cells may be an effective predictive factor of radiation pneumonia.",Excluded
476,"Increased radiation from Chernobyl decreases the expression of red colouration in natural populations of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) Pheomelanin is a pink to red version of melanin pigment deposited in skin and hair. Due to its bright colour, pheomelanin plays a crucial function in signalling, in particular sexual signalling. However, production of pheomelanin, as opposed to its dark alternative, eumelanin, bears costs in terms of consumption of antioxidants important for protection of DNA against naturally produced reactive oxidative species. Therefore, decreased expression of pheomelanin is expected in organisms exposed to severe oxidative stress such as that caused by exposure to chronic ionizing radiation. We tested if variable exposure to radiation among natural populations of bank voles Myodes glareolus in Chernobyl affected expression of red colouration in their dorsal fur. The relative redness of dorsal fur was positively correlated with weight, but also negatively correlated with the level of background radiation. These results suggest that the development of the natural red colouration in adult bank voles is affected by ionizing background radiation, and potentially causing elevated levels of oxidative stress. Reduced production of pheomelanin allows more antioxidants to mitigate the oxidative stress caused by radiation. However, changing natural animal colouration for physiological reasons can have ecological costs, if e.g. it causes mismatch with habitat colouration and conspicuousness for predators.",Included
2109,"Radiation dose optimization of a dual tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma: A Whole body ultra-low dose CT Aim/Introduction: To design an optimized dual-tracer PET/CT protocol for multiple myeloma and to retrospectively review the radiation dose received by patients who underwent this procedure. Material(s) and Method(s): In a research project carried out in our PET department, a dual-tracer PET/CT scan covering head to feet and a whole-body low dose CT (WBLDCT) were prescribed for patients with multiple myeloma. For the scope of optimization, PET/CT and WBLDCT were merged in a one-stop-shop. Thus, FDG PET/CT included a diagnostic CT (WBLDCT: 120 kV-80 mAs) while MET PET/ CT included a CT dedicated only for attenuation correction, referred as whole body ultra-low dose CT (WBULDCT: 100 kV-40 mAs). Both PET/CT scans covered the whole patient from head to feet, in supine position with the arms beside the body. Thirty-one patients with proven multiple myeloma who underwent this protocol were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data and dose parameters (doselength product, DLP) were recorded. Effective doses were calculated with CT-Expo for the CT component and with dose coefficients for the PET contribution (0.019 mSv/MBq for FDG and 0.0084 mSv/MBq for MET). Result(s): We analyzed 31 patients, 23 males and 8 females, aged 59 +/- 10 years, with BMI 27.0 +/- 3.8 kg/m2. DLP expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) was 790 (IQR: 282) mGy.cm for WBLDCT and 262 (IQR: 123) mGy.cm for WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients received a median effective dose of 6.4 (IQR: 2.0) mSv from the WBLDCT and 2.1 (IQR: 0.8) mSv from the WBULDCT (p<0.0001). Patients were administered 327 +/- 75 MBq of FDG and 469 +/- 50 MBq of MET. The resultant effective doses (mean +/- standard deviation) were 6.2 +/- 1.4 mSv and 3.9 +/- 0.4 mSv, respectively. Total effective dose for each PET/ CT was 12.7 +/- 3.0 mSv for FDG and 6.1 +/- 0.8 mSv for MET. Conclusion(s): In this protocol for multiple myeloma evaluation, radiation dose optimization achieved due to both, the merge of nuclear medicine and radiological examinations, and to the inclusion of a WBULDCT (with a 66.7% dose reduction respect to the WBLDCT), entailed a great benefit for the patients. An effort in reviewing each PET/CT indication could lead to the customization and optimization of protocols and to the subsequent dose reduction.",Excluded
2406,"Reduction of radiation exposure in cryoballoon ablation procedures: a single-centre study applying intracardiac echocardiography and other radioprotective measures Aims: The population treated with cryoballoon (CB) ablation is relatively young, and radiation protection is of major importance. We aimed to demonstrate that radiation exposure can be markedly reduced by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and optimized settings of the X-ray system., Methods and results: We analysed 100 patients undergoing CB pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In 50 consecutive patients (25 male, 59 +/- 13 years; Group 1), we used ICE, skipped PV angiography prior to CB inflation, and avoided fluoroscopy whenever possible. Furthermore, we reduced the frame rate, minimized distance between patient and detector, and consequently applied collimation. These patients were compared with 50 similar preceding patients in Group 2 (29 male, 61 +/- 12 years). Total fluoroscopy time was reduced from 18 +/- 6 min in Group 2 to 12 +/- 5 min in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the dose area product was significantly lower (1555 +/- 1219 vs. 4935 +/- 2094 cGycm2, P < 0.001), total freezing time was significantly shortened (1855 +/- 399 vs. 2121 +/- 756 s, P = 0.031), and contrast media use was significantly reduced (66 +/- 25 vs. 109 +/- 27 mL, P < 0.001). At the same time, total procedure duration and complication rates did not differ significantly between both groups. After a 12 months follow-up, a similar percentage of patients was free from recurrences (74% in Group 1 vs. 78% in Group 2, P = 0.640)., Conclusion: Radiation exposure in CB PVI can be markedly reduced without prolonging procedure times, affecting the outcome or complication rates. Moreover, ICE seems to shorten total freezing time. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2016.

Biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), and overall survival (OS) were selected as study endpoints. Survival was examined using the log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox regression modelling. Urinary, quality of life (QoL), and potency scores at baseline and last follow-up were recorded., RESULTS: The median follow-up was 12.5 years (range, 10.1-21.8 years). At the time of analysis, 88.6% of patients were alive, 1.5% died from prostate cancer and 13.9% developed biochemical failure, with 82% of failures occurring in the first decade of follow-up. Overall, 2.3% developed distant metastases. On multivariate analyses, stage T3a-T3b, prostate-specific antigen level of >20 ng/mL, intermediate- and high-risk disease predicted worse BFFS; whereas age >70 years at diagnosis and stage T3a-T3b predicted worse OS. A total biologically effective dose of >=150 Gy and androgen-deprivation therapy were associated with improved BFFS, but not OS. The overall 17-year rates for BFFS, DMFS, PCSS, and OS were 79, 97, 97, and 72%, respectively. Respective 17-year BFFS rates for low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients were 86, 80, and 65% (P < 0.001), whereas OS rates for the same groups were 82, 73, and 60%, respectively (P = 0.09). Amongst those patients who were potent at baseline, 25% remained potent at the last follow-up. Urinary function and QoL were mainly unaffected., CONCLUSIONS: LDR-BT yields excellent survival rates, with a 17-year PCSS rate of 97%. In all, 18% of patients with biochemical relapse failed at >10 years after implantation, which justifies their continued follow-up.

1377,"Detection of unwarranted CT radiation exposure from patient and imaging protocol meta-data using regularized regression Background: Variability in radiation exposure from CT scans can be appropriate and driven by patient features such as body habitus. Quantitative analysis may be performed to discover instances of unwarranted radiation exposure and to reduce the probability of such occurrences in future patient visits. No universal process to perform identification of outliers is widely available, and access to expertise and resources is variable. Objective(s): The goal of this study is to develop an automated outlier detection procedure to identify all scans with an unanticipated high radiation exposure, given the characteristics of the patient and the type of the exam. Material(s) and Method(s): This Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective cohort study was conducted from June 30, 2012 - December 31, 2013 in a quaternary academic medical center. The de-identified dataset contained 28 fields for 189,959 CT exams. We applied the variable selection method Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select important variables for predicting CT radiation dose. We then employed a regression approach that is robust to outliers, to learn from data a predictive model of CT radiation doses given important variables identified by LASSO. Patient visits whose predicted radiation dose was statistically different from the radiation dose actually received were identified as outliers. Result(s): Our methodology identified 1% of CT exams as outliers. The top-5 predictors discovered by LASSO and strongly correlated with radiation dose were Tube Current, kVp, Weight, Width of collimator, and Reference milliampere-seconds. A human expert validation of the outlier detection algorithm has yielded specificity of 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92]and sensitivity of 0.91 [95% CI 0.85-0.97](PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.92). These values substantially outperform alternative methods we tested (F1 score 0.88 for our method against 0.51 for the alternatives). Conclusion(s): The study developed and tested a novel, automated method for processing CT scanner meta-data to identify CT exams where patients received an unwarranted amount of radiation. Radiation safety and protocol review committees may use this technique to uncover systemic issues and reduce future incidents.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded
330,"Experienced Mindfulness Meditators Exhibit Higher Parietal-Occipital EEG Gamma Activity during NREM Sleep Over the past several years meditation practice has gained increasing attention as a non-pharmacological intervention to provide health related benefits, from promoting general wellness to alleviating the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions. However, the effects of meditation training on brain activity still need to be fully characterized. Sleep provides a unique approach to explore the meditation-related plastic changes in brain function. In this study we performed sleep high-density electroencephalographic (hdEEG) recordings in long-term meditators (LTM) of Buddhist meditation practices (approximately 8700 mean hours of life practice) and meditation naive individuals. We found that LTM had increased parietal-occipital EEG gamma power during NREM sleep. This increase was specific for the gamma range (25-40 Hz), was not related to the level of spontaneous arousal during NREM and was positively correlated with the length of lifetime daily meditation practice. Altogether, these findings indicate that meditation practice produces measurable changes in spontaneous brain activity, and suggest that EEG gamma activity during sleep represents a sensitive measure of the long-lasting, plastic effects of meditative training on brain function. © 2013 Ferrarelli et al.",Excluded
1281,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae may cause dyspnoea and hospitalisations in young healthy adults Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostics for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) from the respiratory tract has become widely available, but the interpretation of the results remains unclear. M. pneumoniae has been suggested to cause mainly mild and self-limiting infections or asymptomatic carriage. However, systematic analyses of the association between PCR results and clinical findings are scarce. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of PCR-positive M. pneumoniae infections in a hospital setting. We reviewed 103 PCR-positive patients cared for in a university hospital during a 3-year period. Data on age, sex, health condition, acute symptoms, other pathogens found, laboratory and X-ray results and treatments were collected. Over 85% of the patients had a triad of typical symptoms: fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract were rare. In 91% of the cases, M. pneumoniae was the only pathogen found. The highest incidence was found in the age group of 30-40 years, and 68% of the patients did not have any underlying diseases. Most patients were initially empirically treated with beta-lactam antibiotics and needed 2-4 changes in their treatment. Only 6% were discharged without an antibiotic effective against M. pneumoniae. This study shows that M. pneumoniae often led to hospitalisation and that patients needed appropriate antimicrobial treatment to recover. Mixed infections were rare, and situations that could be interpreted as carriage did not occur.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
2126,"Increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation in mice with ST6Gal-1 deficiency Sporadic reports have associated the degree of N-linked alpha2,6 sialylation, mediated by the sialyltransferase ST6Gal-1, with increased chemo-and radio-resistance of tumor cells, therapeutic failures in colorectal cancers, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Radiation exposure, whether iatrogenic or accidental, is a significant health concern. ST6Gal-1 has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for exposure to ionizing radiation; both enzyme expression and the level of protein sialylation increase following radiation exposure in a dose dependent manner. Here we report a striking sensitivity of animals with non-functional ST6Gal-1 to ionizing radiation. We attempted to rescue st6gal1-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice that were subjected to 12 Gy full body irradiation by bone marrow transplantation with congenic wild-type marrow cells. While the wild-type, st6gal1-normal animals uniformly survived the procedure, st6gal1-KO mice suffered 100% morbidity within 8 days of irradiation. There was comparable homing and retention of donor cells to the marrow of st6gal1-KO and wild-type recipients, and failure of hematopoietic cell engraftment was unlikely as a cause for morbidity. However, st6gal1-KO recipients suffered heavy damage to the gastrointestinal tract resulting in an almost complete loss of absorptive tissue and integrity of the gastrointestinal architecture. This damage was far less severe in the wild-type recipients. Damage to the gastrointestinal tract is an especially frequent and detrimental complication of radiation used in cancer therapy. Our data indicate a critical role for ST6Gal-1 in the maintenance of radioresistance in the gastrointestinal tract.",Included

METHOD(S): Thirty patients underwent low- and routine-dose CT scans in the nephrographic and excretory phases of CT urography. Low-dose CT was reconstructed with AIDR 3D, and routine-dose CT was reconstructed with FBP. In quantitative analyses, image noises were measured on the renal cortex, aorta, retroperitoneal fat, and psoas muscle in both CT scans and compared. Qualitative analyses of the urinary system were performed in both CT scans and compared. These results were compared on the basis of the body mass index (BMI) of the patients. The CT dose index (CTDIvol) was measured, and the dose reduction was calculated. RESULT(S): In quantitative analyses, image noises in all organs on low-dose CT were less than those on routine-dose CT in both phases independently of the patient's BMI. There were no statistical differences between low- and routine-dose CT for diagnostic acceptability on all urinary systems in both phases independently of the patient's BMI. The average CTDIvol on routine-dose CT was 14.5 mGy in the nephrographic phase and 9.2 mGy in the excretory phase. The average CTDIvol on low-dose CT was 4.2 mGy in the nephrographic phase and 2.7 mGy in the excretory phase. CONCLUSION(S): Low-dose CT urography using AIDR 3D can offer diagnostic acceptability comparable with routine-dose CT urography with FBP with approximately 70% dose reduction.

1505,"Irradiation of adult human dental pulp stem cells provokes activation of p53, cell cycle arrest, and senescence but not apoptosis Adult human dental pulp contains stem cells (DPSCs) that are capable of differentiation into osteoblasts, odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neuronal-like cells. Because these cells have potential use in tissue regeneration, herein we characterized the response of DPSC lines to ionizing radiation (IR). These DPSC lines have been developed from the extracted molars of healthy donors. DPSCs were cultivated in a unique media supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Since tissue homeostasis depends on a precise balance among cell proliferation, senescence, and cell death, we explored the effects of IR (2-20 Gy) on the proliferative activity of DPSCs and the molecular pathways involved. Even the highest dose used (20 Gy) did not induce DPSC apoptosis. After irradiation with doses of 6 and 20 Gy, DPSCs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. DPSCs responded to IR (20 Gy) with senescence detected as SA-beta-galactosidase positivity, beginning on the third day after irradiation. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, p53 and its serine 15 and 392 phosphorylated forms were detected. At this time, p21 (WAF1) was induced. Increases in protein p16 were observed from the third day following irradiation and continued till the end of the examination (Day 13). We conclude that DPSCs respond to IR-induced damage by permanent cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase and by stress-induced premature senescence. © 2010, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Included

Platelet aggregation after adenosine diphosphate stimulation was studied in the platelet rich plasma obtained from 37 patients who underwent left ventriculography using the highly sensitive method of particle counting with laser-light scattering. Platelet activation by contrast media was studied in the platelet rich plasma from healthy volunteers using flow cytometric analysis to detect platelet degranulation as P-selectin expression. There was a significant decrease in platelet aggregation in patients injected with ioxilan or iomeprol compared with patients injected with iohexol. There was a significant increase in P-selectin expression with the three groups of contrast media compared to control. The platelet activation with ioxilan or iomeprol was significantly less compared to the activation with iohexol. The comparison showed that previous generalization regarding platelet activation by nonionic contrast media might not be valid. It is presumed that the higher osmolality of iohexol may contribute to the increase in platelet aggregation and activation.",Excluded
1242,"Human mononuclear cell in vitro activation in microgravity and post-spaceflight The results of postflight and inflight human in vitro lymphocyte experiments have been reviewed. The cumulative data indicate that mitogen-stimulated T-cell proliferation is blunted following short-duration missions. Since similar responses may also be obtained following exposure to non-spaceflight stressors (hypoxia and academic stress), it is unclear if microgravity per se aggravates this response. Our studies indicate that stress-induced impaired PHA- and PWM-stimulated activation can be detected within the first 24 hours in culture at the level of protein synthesis. While the mechanism for neuroendocrine-mediated blunted mitogen stimulated T cell proliferation has not been elucidated, it is not aggravated by autologous plasma and does not require changes in mononuclear cell subpopulations. While prior studies indicate lymphocyte activation is influenced by altering G forces on in vitro cultures, impaired cellular interactions or suboptimal microenvironments related to reduced cell densities in microgravity may contribute to the greatly impaired mitogen stimulated proliferation responses observed on Spacelab flights. It will be necessary to perform lymphocyte functional assays on crewmembers during spaceflight to determine to contribution of microgravity per se on altered human immune competence.",Excluded
223,"Personalized space radiation dosimetry using monte carlo simulations of CT-based geometries exposed to solar particle event radiation Purpose/Objective(s): A serious concern for space exploration to the Moon or Mars is astronaut exposure to ionizing radiation in a solar particle event (SPE). SPE are unpredictable, variable in intensity and energy spectrum, and are primarily protons with kinetic energies below 100 MeV. The dose from an SPE is highly inhomogeneous and sensitive to physical parameters such as energy spectrum, shielding, and anisotropy. The biological effects of low dose-rate proton radiation are not fully understood. Interpretation of data from ground-based experiments in animal models is complicated by inhomogeneous distribution of dose to sensitive organs. Planning and preparation for space exploration vitally relies on accurate prediction of the health risk associated with exposure to SPE. Materials/Methods: We have developed a Monte Carlo radiation transport tool that incorporates CT scans into dose calculations of radiobiological experiments in animal models and simulated exposure of humans to SPE radiation. This allows accurate predictions of SPE dose and is used to develop dose-toxicity data for pre-clinical animal experiments and for predicting astronaut organ doses from exposure to SPE radiation. Result(s): We validated this tool using phantom measurements and determine organ doses for Yucatan mini-pigs exposed to simulated SPE radiation designed to match 3 historical events with relatively low (October, 1989), intermediate (September, 1989) and high (August, 1972) levels of >100 MeV protons to model toxicity vs dose in critical internal organs. These studies show a paradoxical increase in clinical/systemic toxicity for SPE with lower internal dose that appears to correlate with suppression of leukocyte counts. For astronaut SPE exposures, we applied this tool to 4 different human model (2 male, 2 female) astronauts exposed to the 3 SPE in geometries designed to simulate exposure within a space suit or capsule. The results indicate that not only does an astronaut's dose to specific organs (e.g., skin, eyes, and lungs) differ substantially for different SPE, different astronauts receive significantly different organ doses even with the same SPE exposure. Conclusion(s): These studies clearly show the value of our dosimetry system for two critically interrelated uses: determining the dose to organ systems for SPE exposed astronauts and helping ensure that earth based experiments reproduce appropriate dose distributions in order to maximize the applicability of these findings. Our results suggest that a personalized approach for astronaut dosimetry may be valuable in determining the course of clinical action in the event of an SPE exposure.",Included
609,"Coronary CT angiography of patients with a normal body mass index using 80 kVp versus 100 kVp: a prospective, multicenter, multivendor randomized trial OBJECTIVE: We determined the effect of reduced 80-kVp tube voltage on the radiation dose and image quality of coronary CT angiography (CTA) in patients with a normal body mass index (BMI)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, multivendor trial was performed of 208 consecutive patients with a normal BMI (< 25 kg/m(2)) who had been referred for coronary CTA and did not have a history of coronary revascularization. Patients were randomized to 80-kVp imaging (n = 103) or 100-kVp imaging (n = 105). Three blinded readers graded interpretability and image quality. Study signal, noise, and contrast were also compared., RESULTS: Imaging with 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with 47% lower median radiation dose (median dose-length product, 62.0 mGy . cm [interquartile range, 54.0-123.3 mGy . cm] vs 117.0 mGy . cm [110.0-225.9 mGy . cm], respectively; 0.9 mSv [0.8-1.7 mSv] vs 1.6 mSv [1.4-3.2 mSv]; p < 0.001 for each) with no significant difference in interpretability (99% vs 99%; p = 0.99) or image quality (median score, 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.6-4.0] vs 4.0 [interquartile range, 3.8-4.0]; p = 0.20). Studies obtained using 80 kVp were associated with 27% increased signal (mean +/- SD, 756 +/- 157 vs 594 +/- 105 HU; p < 0.001), 25% higher contrast (890 +/- 156 vs 709 +/- 108 HU; p < 0.001), and 50% greater noise (55 +/- 15 vs 37 +/- 12 HU; p < 0.001) with resultant 15% and 16% decreases in signal-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 15 +/- 5 vs 17 +/- 5; p < 0.001) and contrast-to-noise (mean +/- SD, 17 +/- 6 vs 21 +/- 5; p < 0.001) ratios, respectively., CONCLUSION: Coronary CTA using 80 kVp instead of 100 kVp was associated with a nearly 50% reduction in radiation dose with no significant difference in interpretability and noninferior image quality despite lower signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios. The use of 80-kVp tube voltage should be considered in dose-reduction strategies for coronary CTA of individuals with a normal BMI.",Excluded
1809,"Significant correlations between human cortical bone mineral density and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) obtained with 3D Cones ultrashort echo time magnetic resonance imaging (UTE-MRI) PURPOSE: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) MRI is a tool that can characterize changes in susceptibility, an intrinsic property which is associated with compositional changes in the tissue. Current QSM estimation of cortical bone is challenging because conventional clinical MRI cannot acquire signal in cortical bone. This study aimed to implement Cones 3D ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) for ex vivo QSM measurements in human tibial cortical bone, investigating the correlations of QSM with volumetric intracortical bone mineral density (BMD)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine tibial midshaft cortical bone specimens (25mm long specimens cut at the mid-point of tibial shaft, 67+/-20years old, 5 women and 4 men) were scanned on a clinical 3T MRI scanner for QSM measurement. The specimens were also scanned on a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (muCT) scanner for volumetric BMD estimation. QSM and muCT results were compared at approximately nine regions of interest (ROIs) per specimen., RESULTS: Average 3D UTE-MRI QSM showed significantly strong correlation with volumetric BMD (R=-0.82, P<0.01) and bone porosity (R=0.72, P<0.01). Combining all data points together (77 ROIs), QSM showed significant moderate to strong correlation with volumetric BMD after correction for interdependencies in specimens (R=-0.70, P<0.01). The corrections were required because the data points were not independent in each specimen. Similarly, the correlation between QSM and porosity was significant (R=0.68, P<0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the Cones 3D UTE-MRI QSM technique can potentially serve as a novel and accurate tool to assess intracortical bone mineral density whilst avoiding ionizing radiation.

2544,"The association between cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancers during radiotherapy Background: Quality of life can be influenced by oral mucositis (OM), and it is necessary to implement OM management strategies before the initiation of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Aim(s): To examine the association between the cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe OM in HNC patients receiving RT. Methods and Results: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, in Japan. We retrospectively analyzed 94 patients with HNC who developed OM during RT. We defined OM as a more than grade 2 OM. The cumulative incidence of OM curves of the two categories was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for OM after the adjustment of factors for covariates using Cox's regression analysis. Patients with smoking history had a significantly later development of OM than those with no smoking history (20 Gy-incidence OM 68.7% vs 39.7%, P =.003). In contrast, patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy had an earlier development of OM than those undergoing RT alone (20 Gy-incidence OM 24.2% vs 55.7%, P <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy were independent predictive factors, with a HR of 0.526 (P =.025) and 2.690 (P <.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy may be predictive of OM in HNC patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

We investigated their use as potential biomarkers to identify individuals exposed to ionizing radiation. We collected exfoliated oral epithelial cell samples from 100 healthy individuals undergoing routine dental radiographic examination (2.34 cGy) both before and after the radiograph using a non-invasive technique. The expression levels of pChk2 and gamma-H2AX in oral cells were assessed by immunohistochemical assay. Both biomarkers showed statistically significant increases in levels of expression after the radiation exposure (P < 0.001). This suggests that pChk2 and gamma-H2AX may serve as sensitive indicators of low-dose radiation exposure.",Included
204,"Treatment efficiency of combining photodynamic therapy and ionizing radiation for Bowen's disease BACKGROUND: Topical 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) is widely used for treating Bowen's disease (BD), but recurrence and tumour cell persistence after ALA-PDT is sometimes problematic. Radiation therapy (RT) is also effective for BD, but is limited by its side-effects, such as refractory ulcers., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe a synergic effect of combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT for BD cases that did not respond effectively to prior ALA-PDT., METHODS: Subjects were BD patients whose lesion did not show complete remission or showed recurrence after prior ALA-PDT. A total of four cases involving four lesions were studied (three male and one female, mean age 69.5). ALA ointment (20%) was applied to the lesions. After 4 to 6h, subjects received combination therapy consisting of excimer-pumped dye laser radiation at 630nm (50J/cm(2) ) followed by electron-beam radiation (3Gy). The combination therapy was repeated every 2 to 3days for a total of four treatments. The lesions were evaluated clinically or histologically after the final combination therapy session., RESULTS: Following combination therapy, all of the lesions disappeared. Recurrence was not detected during the observations periods, which averaged 14.0months in duration., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the cure rate of BD could be improved by combination therapy with ALA-PDT and RT. Compared with conventional RT, the synergetic effect of this therapy might reduce the dose of radiation required, thereby also reducing skin side-effects such as refractory ulcers.

1652,"Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway, X-ray exposure, and lung cancer risk: a multicenter case-control study in Central Europe Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) results in various types of DNA damage and is a suspected cause of lung cancer. An essential cellular machinery against DNA damage is cell cycle control, which is regulated by several genes, including TP53, CCND1, and CDKN2A. Therefore, we hypothesized that the genetic variants in these three genes influence the predisposition of lung cancer (i.e., CCND1 G870A, CDKN2A Ala(148)Thr, TP53 Arg(72)Pro, and 16-bp repeat in intron 3) and that the effect of X-ray on lung cancer risk can be modified by the presence of these genetic variations. The study was conducted in 15 centers in 6 countries of Central Europe between 1998 and 2002. A total of 2,238 cases and 2,289 controls were recruited and provided DNA samples. Cases with positive family history were analyzed separately. The joint effect of X-ray and previous risk genotypes was assessed, and modification by sequence variants on X-ray dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk was evaluated. We found an overall effect of TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats [odds ratio (OR), 1.99; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.27-3.13], which was stronger among cases with family history of lung cancer (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.29-6.87). In addition, our results suggested an interaction that was greater than multiplicativity between TP53 intron 3 16-bp repeats and multiple X-ray exposures (interaction OR, 5.69; 95% CI, 1.33-24.3). We did not observe a main effect of CCND1 G870A polymorphism; however, the dose-response relationship between lung cancer risk and X-ray exposures was modified by CCND1 genotype with no risk from X-ray exposures among subjects who carried G/G genotype, intermediate risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05-1.27) among subjects with G/A genotype, and highest risk [trend OR for X-ray, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.12-1.49) among subjects with A/A genotype. Sequence variants in cell cycle control pathway may increase the risk of lung cancer and modify the risk conferred by multiple X-ray exposures. However, a definite conclusion can only be drawn on replication by different studies among individuals who are highly exposed to IR.",Included
3189,"UVR2 ensures transgenerational genome stability under simulated natural UV-B in Arabidopsis thaliana Ground levels of solar UV-B radiation induce DNA damage. Sessile phototrophic organisms such as vascular plants are recurrently exposed to sunlight and require UV-B photoreception, flavonols shielding, direct reversal of pyrimidine dimers and nucleotide excision repair for resistance against UV-B radiation. However, the frequency of UV-B-induced mutations is unknown in plants. Here we quantify the amount and types of mutations in the offspring of Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and UV-B-hypersensitive mutants exposed to simulated natural UV-B over their entire life cycle. We show that reversal of pyrimidine dimers by UVR2 photolyase is the major mechanism required for sustaining plant genome stability across generations under UV-B. In addition to widespread somatic expression, germline-specific UVR2 activity occurs during late flower development, and is important for ensuring low mutation rates in male and female cell lineages. This allows plants to maintain genome integrity in the germline despite exposure to UV-B.",Excluded
297,"Effects of medical diagnostic X-rays delivered at 0.01 or 0.05 mGy on human blood cells Background: Low-dose X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging to help in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the deleterious effects of exposure to medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays remain a highly debated topic. The objective was to study the effects of medical diagnostic X-rays on human blood cells. Material(s) and Method(s): We studied the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays (80 kVp), i.e.,0.01 or 0.05 mGy, after the in vitro exposure of human red blood cells (RBCs) and peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs).Cells with no irradiation served as the control group. The biological endpoints that were used to determine the effects of medical diagnostic low-dose X-rays were hemolysis for RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomes, and the cell cycle for PBMCs. Result(s): Our results showed no changes in the hemolysis of RBCs and mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosome, or cell cycle in cells exposed to these low doses of X-rays when compared to the corresponding nonirradiated cells at all harvest timepoints. Conclusion(s): These results suggested that there were no deleterious effects of diagnostic low-dose X-rays when human RBCs and PBMCs were exposed in vitro.Copyright © 2021, Ibn Sina Trust.

630,"Exposure of patients to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional imaging and procedures: Dose estimation and analysis of gamma-H2AX foci and gene expression in blood lymphocytes Radiation has widespread applications in medicine. However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD. Patients undergoing interventional procedures receive considerable radiation doses, resulting in DNA damage and altered gene expression. Medical procedures should be carried out using the lowest radiation doses possible without compromising treatment. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded

All stones were located in the renal pelvis with mild to moderate hydronephrosis seen on intravenous urography. A ureteral stent was inserted cystoscopically, and saline was injected for more localization of the pelvicaliceal system (PCS), if needed. Puncture of the PCS was performed with an 18-gauge nephrostomy needle through the lower pole calyx, and all the stages, including dilatation, were performed under ultrasonography guidance. Result(s): Thirty-nine patients were stone free in the kidneys, ureters, and bladder the day after the operation. Five patients had multiple fragments that measured about 4 to 5mm, which passed in 4 weeks (total stone-free rate: 93.61%); failure occurred in two patients, and fluoroscopy was needed; two patients who had residual fragments that measured 10 and 12mm underwent shockwave lithotripsy; and in one patient, a fragment that measured 7 to 8mm migrated into the ureterit fragmented and was removed with a ureteroscope 2 days after the operation. Conclusion(s): PCNL using sonography is a good alternative to the fluoroscopic method. It is performed without radiation exposure to the surgeon and patient; however, more experience is needed.

2682,"Analysis of radiological factors promoting degeneration in adjacent disc levels after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion Objective: Adjacent segment disease (ASD) is considered an important prognostic factor of long-term results after cervical anterior fusion. However, factors contributing to ASD are not clearly understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the radiological factors contributing to ASD after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Method(s): Disc levels (145) of 72 patients who underwent ACDF and had radiological observation for more than 5 years after surgery were included in this study. There were 49 males and 23 females, with a mean age of 54.3 years at the time of surgery. All patients underwent the modified Smith-Robinsons method using titanium cages. Radiological assessments were performed by dynamic X-ray and MRI prior to surgery, 1 or 2 weeks postoperatively, and at final follow-up. When any radiological degeneration was detected at follow-up, ASD was judged as present at the level of interest. Radiological factors (e.g., range of motion, pre-operative status, post-operative change) were analyzed on all operated levels and adjacent disc levels and on cervical alignment of all patients. Intra-operative needle placement to the disc space for marking was also studied to determine contribution to ASD. Result(s): ASD was significantly related to canal stenosis (p = 0.00328, Chi square test), pre-operative larger segmental range of motion (ROM) of adjacent segments (p = 0.00911), and preoperative intensity change of adjacent discs on MRI (p = 0.000527). None of the factors on operated levels and cervical alignment statistically contributed to ASD. Intra-operative needle insertion to the non-operated disc levels was more frequently related to ASD (p = 0.00330). Conclusion(s): ASD may be related to adjacent disc levels not the operated level or cervical alignment. Patients with canal stenosis, preoperative degeneration or larger ROM of adjacent levels have a significantly higher incidence of ASD. Although ACDF is a useful and widely accepted method for cervical spondylosis, careful post-operative observation is needed.",Excluded

The samples exposed under in vitro condition showed that the frequency of translocation and dicentric followed Poisson distribution ('u' varied between -0.04 and +1.41 for translocation and between -0.09 and +1.81 for DC) and that obtained with MN follow over dispersion ('u' varied between +2.04 and +9.28). However, the cervical cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy showed over dispersion for all these three aberrations (DC, MN and translocation). The frequencies of aberrations obtained in cancer patients were found to be lower than those obtained for in vitro exposure for doses more than 2 Gy equivalent whole body dose (EWBD). The dose-response curves were constructed using the frequencies of DC, MN and translocation as a function of EWBD. Doses as measured from the dose response curves were compared with the estimated dose in order to check whether the measured and estimated doses agree. The percent variation between the doses measured from aberration frequencies and that of the estimated dose was lower with translocation (10.8+/-7.41%) compared to those obtained with DC (38.08+/-31.85%) and MN (47.19+/-31.80%).

In this study, patient exposure data is collected from 13 countries (37 clinics and nearly 50 interventional rooms) and for 10 different procedures. Dose data was collected from a total of 14,922 interventional cardiology procedures. Based on these data European diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for air kerma-area product are suggested for coronary angiography (CA, DRL = 35 Gy cm2), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 85 Gy cm2), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, 130 Gy cm2), electrophysiological procedures (12 Gy cm2) and pacemaker implantations. Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure.

2431,"Time sequence of cancer occurrence. Implications in low level radiation risk assessment A total of 8 229 C57 Black mice of both sexes were randomly assigned to various groups. In some groups, mice aged 33 +/- 3 days were submitted to either sham, neutron or cobalt external radiation at 32, 45, 63, 88 and 123 mGy or at 18, 25, 36 and 51 cGy dose levels, respectively. In other groups, mice either at birth or weaning, were injected with tritiated thymidine or tritiated water, or were given tritiated water as drinking water for the entire lifespan. The main purpose of the experiment was to investigate the low dose-response relationship of cancer induction, especially leukemogenesis and to evaluate the excess risk, using actuarial age-specific rates. Following neutron or cobalt exposure, the phenotypic occurrence of lymphocytic lymphomas was earlier in appearance and higher in yield during the first decades of lifespan in irradiated groups versus matching controls, whereas such occurrence was markedly lower in yield at a later age. Under parallel experimental conditions, induction of reticulum cell lymphomas, however, was uniformly enhanced throughout the entire lifespan. Induction rates of all tumors (reticular and solid) pooled were significantly increased, and more so following cobalt than neutron irradiation. In mice injected with tritiated thymidine, the overall tumor incidence was increased monotonically throughout the lifespan. In mice exposed to tritiated water, the incidence of lymphocytic lymphomas was markedly increased throughout the lifespan, whereas no such effect was observed for reticulum cell tumors. In the light of tumor data analysis, it appears that selection of a particular type of tumor as a dependent variable for dose-response assessment cannot disregard the primary modulation of the whole tumor spectrum. In C57 Black murine leukemogenesis, the shape and structure of the dose-response regression curve over the entire lifespan does not fit the linear-quadratic model. It is, however, theorized that our data are consistent with the two-mutation clonal expansion model, assuming creation of initiated cells which are added to the pool of spontaneously occurring initiated cells and implying that the excess risk is initially high at early age and then decreases with increasing age following exposure. It is concluded that murine radiocarcinogenesis investigation may contribute to improving the assessment as well as understanding the underlying mechanisms of low level radiation hazards.

Experiments repeated with cells stored in liquid nitrogen showed that the survival assay gave highly reproducible results. The melanomas exhibited individual and characteristic survival curves whether exposed to radiation or heat (43.5 degrees C). The Do-values were in the ranges 0.63-1.66 Gy (X-rays) and 33-58 min (heat). The survival curves were similar to those reported previously for human melanoma xenografts. The radiation sensitivity of the cells was not correlated to the heat sensitivity. Since the melanomas appeared to be very heterogeneous in radiation response in vitro as melanomas are known to be clinically, it is suggested that melanomas may be suitable for prospective studies aimed at establishing whether clinical radioresponsiveness somehow is related to in vitro survival curve parameters.",Excluded
624,"Cerebral computed tomographic angiography using third-generation reconstruction algorithm provides improved image quality with lower contrast and radiation dose PURPOSE: We hypothesized that cerebral CT angiogram performed using third-generation reconstruction algorithm and lower contrast dose-low-kVp technique (LD-CTA) will provide better image quality when compared with regular contrast dose CTA at 120 kVp using a sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction algorithm (ND-CTA)., METHODS: Retrospective imaging review of 100 consecutive patients (50 each in LD- and ND-CTA groups). Two readers independently assessed the subjective image quality across multiple vascular segments on a Likert-like scale. Differences in contrast dose, CT dose index (CTDI), and dose length product (DLP) were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Fisher's exact test was used to compare subjective image quality. Similarly, contrast- and signal-to-noise ratios (CNR and SNR) were compared in the mid-M1 MCA vessels bilaterally and the mid-basilar artery using Mann-Whitney U test. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the SNR/CNR values., RESULTS: Both observers showed excellent correlation in subjective image quality (mean percentage agreement of 95.2% for group 1 versus 89.2% for group 2). LD-CTA group showed better SNR and CNR (p < 0.0001) for both MCA vessels and the mid-basilar artery. Interclass correlation coefficient showed moderate correlation (0.51-0.63) between readers. LD-CTA group also used lower contrast (49 cc versus 97 cc in ND-CTA) and had lower radiation exposure (DLP/CTDI for both groups 268.3/80.7 vs 519.5/36.08, both < 0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Next-generation reconstruction algorithm and low-kV scanning significantly improved image quality on cerebral CTA images despite lower contrast dose and, in addition, have lower radiation exposure.",Excluded
1800,"Proton beam radiotherapy: report of the first ten patients treated at the ""Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO)"" for skull base and spine tumours The Italian National Centre for Oncological Hadrontherapy (Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica, CNAO), equipped with a proton and ion synchrotron, started clinical activity in September 2011. The clinical and technical characteristics of the first ten proton beam radiotherapy treatments are reported. Ten patients, six males and four females (age range 27-73 years, median 55.5), were treated with proton beam radiotherapy. After one to two surgical procedures, seven patients received a histological diagnosis of chordoma (of the skull base in three cases, the cervical spine in one case and the sacrum in three cases) and three of low-grade chondrosarcoma (skull base). Prescribed doses were 74 GyE for chordoma and 70 GyE for chondrosarcoma at 2 GyE/fraction delivered 5 days per week. Treatment was well tolerated without toxicity-related interruptions. The maximal acute toxicity was grade 2, with oropharyngeal mucositis, nausea and vomiting for the skull base tumours, and grade 2 dermatitis for the sacral tumours. After 6-12 months of follow-up, no patient developed tumour progression. The analysis of the first ten patients treated with proton therapy at CNAO showed that this treatment was feasible and safe. Currently, patient accrual into these as well as other approved protocols is continuing, and a longer follow-up period is needed to assess tumour control and late toxicity.",Excluded
2265,"Effect of radiation fraction size on local control rates for early glottic carcinoma. A model analysis for in vivo tumor growth and radio-response parameters BACKGROUND: Two recent studies have suggested that the probability of local control for early glottic carcinoma (stages T1 and T2) following radiation therapy is lower when daily fractions of 1.8 Gy are given instead of 2.0 Gy when the total dose is kept constant at approximately 66 Gy., METHODS: We reviewed our experience with a total of 42 patients with T1, N0, M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx who were treated with radiation alone during the period 1979 to 1989. All patients received conventional fractionation radiation therapy (one treatment per day, 5 days per week). Eight patients received 2.0 Gy per fraction for an average total dose of 64.8 Gy, and 34 patients received 1.8 Gy per fraction for an average total dose of 66.7 Gy. We also calculated overall survival statistics. Combining the clinical data from our series and those of patients from other series (171 total patients), we analyzed the tumor response curve and doubling time for early glottic carcinoma by using a time-dependent, linear quadratic equation model. The analysis is valid for the typical range of radioresponsiveness for most tumors in healthy tissue., RESULTS: Using statistical z analysis, we noted a significant difference in the local control rates at 5 years, with better local control in the group that received 2.0 Gy per fraction (100% vs 70%). Our results for the calculated doubling time and tumor response curves correspond with experimental values for in vitro squamous cell carcinoma systems., CONCLUSION: It appears from the literature and from our data that the control rates for T1, N0, M0 glottic carcinoma may be significantly improved by using 2.0 Gy per fraction dose vs 1.8 Gy per fraction dose. Our analysis has provided a model of in vivo tumor response of early glottic carcinomas based on reported local control rates using these two different treatment regimens.",Excluded
2733,"Biopsy of peripheral lung nodules utilizing cone beam computer tomography with and without trans bronchial access tool: A retrospective analysis Background: Currently there are several techniques for endoscopic diagnosis of parenchymal lung abnormalities. Electromagnetic navigation with or without endobronchial ultrasound for diagnosis of the above has been well described. Bronchoscopic Trans Bronchial Access Tool is a novel endoscopic technique that creates a virtual pathway to the lesion and is less limited by location of the airway. The CrossCountryTM Transbronchial Access Tool (CovidienTM, Plymouth, MN, USA) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved off airway device that utilizes a catheter equipped guide sheath for a trans-parenchymal approach to a distal lesion. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) is a real-time onsite extrathoracic navigational modality used in the bronchoscopy suite that allows for an open working channel. All three of the above modalities can have reasonable diagnostic yields when used independently. While utilizing the above tools we frequently found ourselves in situations where one technique was not enough, prompting the use of a combination of modalities to obtain the most efficient and accurate diagnosis. We are reporting the feasibility and safety of utilizing these three modalities in conjunction with one another. Method(s): Patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography underwent a navigation bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. CBCT and radial ultrasound was used in every case to confirm navigation to the target lesion. Lesions without definitive airways leading to them were accessed with the transbronchial access tool (TBAT). Result(s): Electromagnetic bronchoscopy using CBCT and radial US was performed on 22 patients from April 2016 to September 2016. The TBAT tool was used in 7 patients. The overall diagnostic yield was 77.2% (17 of 22). Diagnostic yield of with use TBAT was 100% (7 of 7). There were no complications. Average case length was 79.95 (range, 50-124) minutes and average fluoroscopy time was 10.39 (1-21.7) minutes. Conclusion(s): TBAT is a useful and safe tool when accessing peripheral pulmonary nodules and is used in conjunctions with electromagnetic navigation and CBCT.Copyright © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

319,"miRNA-95 mediates radioresistance in tumors by targeting the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1 Radiation resistance poses a major clinical challenge in cancer treatment, but little is known about how microRNA (miR) may regulate this phenomenon. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to perform an unbiased comparison of miR expression in PC3 prostate cancer cells rendered resistant to fractionated radiation treatment. One miR candidate found to be upregulated by ionizing radiation was miR-95, the enforced expression of which promoted radiation resistance in a variety of cancer cells. miR-95 overexpression recapitulated an aggressive phenotype including increased cellular proliferation, deregulated G2-M checkpoint following ionizing radiation, and increased invasive potential. Using combined in silico prediction and microarray expression analyses, we identified and validated the sphingolipid phosphatase SGPP1, an antagonist of sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling, as a target of miR-95 that promotes radiation resistance. Consistent with this finding, cell treatment with FTY720, a clinically approved small molecule inhibitor of S1P signaling, sensitized miR-95 overexpressing cells to radiation treatment. In vivo assays extended the significance of these results, showing that miR-95 overexpression increased tumor growth and resistance to radiation treatment in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, reduced tumor necrosis and increased cellular proliferation were seen after radiation treatment of miR-95 overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors. Finally, miR-95 expression was increased in human prostate and breast cancer specimens compared with normal tissue. Together, our work reveals miR-95 expression as a critical determinant of radiation resistance in cancer cells.",Included
144,"Endoscopic esophageal reconstruction for the treatment of a total and extensive disruption of the esophagus using a ''rendez-vous'' technique INTRODUCTION: Complete esophageal obstruction leads to definitive fasting. The rendez-vous endoscopic approach had already been described for complex stenoses as an alternative to surgery that has high morbid-mortality. AIMS & METHODS: This is a case series report about six patients referred for complete esophageal disruption classified in two groups: 1/ Long disruption (> 5cm), one after caustic ingestion and two due to an esophageal stripping during SEMS removal. Two had an associated loss of the SES; 2/ Short disruption (< 5cm), consecutive to radiation therapy for a neck neoplasia. They had been fasting for 3 to 18 months. All the procedures were performed according the anterograde retrograde approach, under anesthesia and with CO2 insufflation and X-rays guidance. RESULT(S): There were 3 men and women between 25 and 71 years old. All the reconstructions have been successful in one to three endoscopic sessions, using the non hydrophilic tip of a guide wire passed through a straight catheter in 5 cases and a EUS needle in only one case. In 2 cases, a neo-SES had to be created, by transillumination (n=1) or head and neck surgery (n=1). In order to guide the reconstruction, SEMS was used in one case, NGT in one case, and both were used in one patient. The first dilation was performed with a CRE balloon (12-15mm). All the patients could eat mixed after 2 POD. There was no intraoperative or post-operative complication. Then, the patients underwent 3 to 18 dilations sessions during 1.5 to 15 months; two are still undergoing dilations and all eat normally. CONCLUSION(S): Endoscopic rendez-vous for esophageal reconstruction is safe and effective in case of esophageal disruption even with loss of SES, avoiding surgery.",Excluded
453,"Utility of postoperative radiographs for cervical spine fusion: A comprehensive evaluation of operative technique, surgical indication, and duration since surgery STUDY DESIGN.: A retrospective study. OBJECTIVE.: To assess the utility of postoperative radiographs in patients across a spectrum of cervical fusion procedures, surgical indication, and time since surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographs are routinely obtained after cervical spine fusion despite lack of evidence supporting such practice. Studies assessing postoperative radiographical utility in the cervical spine have been limited. To date, no study has comprehensively evaluated the utility of obtaining such radiographs across multiple cervical fusion procedures. METHODS.: A total of 972 clinic notes from 301 patients during a 10-year period at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Patients in this study underwent an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, anterior corpectomy and fusion, a combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion and anterior corpectomy and fusion (hybrid), posterior spine fusion, or 360degree fusion. All postoperative clinic notes and radiographs were reviewed for abnormalities and changes in treatment course. It was determined whether an abnormal radiograph alone led to a change in treatment course among the various operative techniques, surgical indication, or time since surgery. RESULTS.: No statistical significant difference in radiograph utility between anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (0 changes in treatment course due to radiograph alone out of 332 clinic notes), anterior corpectomy and fusion (0 of 140), hybrid procedure (1 of 72), posterior spine fusion (5 of 357), and 360degree fusion (0 of 71) was found. Surgical indication (trauma vs. degeneration) and duration from surgery yielded no statistical significant difference in radiograph utility. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of radiographs were 33.8%, 87.6%, 19.0%, and 93.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION.: Regardless of operative techniques performed, surgical indication, and time since surgery, routine postoperative radiographs provide low utility in guiding treatment course in asymptomatic patients. Although radiographs may provide important diagnostic utility in certain individual cases, the results of this study provide further evidence that radiographs should not be considered routine during postoperative visits, thus minimizing unnecessary radiation exposure and medical costs.

702,"[Intensity-modulated radiation therapy for head and neck cancers with bilateral irradiation of the neck : preliminary results] PURPOSE: To report preliminary results of a prospective study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) with bilateral irradiation of the neck., PATIENTS AND METHODS: At the Alexis Vautrin Cancer Center, 23 patients have been treated with IMRT for HNC since January 2002-August 2003. The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were <4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses <26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia., CONCLUSION: The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years.",Excluded

2001,"Cyberknife treatment for advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma AIM: To investigate the safety and efficacy of the Cyberknife treatment for patients with advanced or terminal stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)., METHODS: Patients with HCC with extrahepatic metastasis or vascular or bile duct invasion were enrolled between May 2011 and June 2015. The Cyberknife was used to treat each lesion. Treatment response scores were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. The trends of tumor markers, including alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and proteins induced by vitamin K absence II (PIVKA II) were assessed. Prognostic factors for tumor response and tumor markers were evaluated with Fisher's exact test and a logistic regression model. Survival was evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model., RESULTS: Sixty-five patients with 95 lesions were enrolled. Based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification, all patients were either in the advanced or terminal stage of the disease. The target lesions were as follows: 52 were bone metastasis; 9, lung metastasis; 7, brain metastasis; 9, portal vein invasion; 4, hepatic vein invasion; 4, bile duct invasion; and 10 other lesion types. The response rate and disease control rate were 34% and 53%, respectively. None of the clinical factors correlated significantly with tumor response. Fiducial marker implantation was associated with better control of both AFP (HR = 0.152; 95%CI: 0.026-0.887; P = 0.036) and PIVKA II (HR = 0.035; 95%CI: 0.003-0.342; P = 0.004). The median survival time was 9 mo (95%CI: 5-15 mo). Terminal stage disease (HR = 9.809; 95%CI: 2.589-37.17, P < 0.001) and an AFP of more than 400 ng/mL (HR = 2.548; 95%CI: 1.070-6.068, P = 0.035) were associated with worse survival. A radiation dose higher than 30 Gy (HR = 0.274; 95%CI: 0.093-0.7541, P = 0.012) was associated with better survival. In the 52 cases of bone metastasis, 36 patients (69%) achieved pain relief. One patient had cerebral bleeding and another patient had an esophageal ulcer after treatment., CONCLUSION: The Cyberknife can be safely administered to patients with advanced or terminal stage HCC. High AFP levels were associated with worse survival, but a higher radiation dose improved the survival.",Excluded
1575,"Improvement of image quality at low-radiation dose and low-contrast material dose abdominal CT in patients with cirrhosis: Intraindividual comparison of low tube voltage with iterative reconstruction algorithm and standard tube voltage OBJECTIVE: To intraindividually compare a low-tube voltage, low-contrast material dose computed tomography (CT) reconstructed with iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithm at standard tube voltage reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and standard-contrast material dose during liver dynamic CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with liver cirrhosis underwent 64-section multidetector CT. One hundred twenty kilovolt (peak) (kV[p]) with standard contrast material dose of 600 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol A) and 80 kV(p) with low-contrast material dose of 450 mg of iodine per kilogram (protocol B) CT image sets were reconstructed by using FBP algorithm and that of using IR algorithm with a 60%/40% blend of IR-FBP reconstruction at 80-kV(p) image set (protocol C). Scans obtained during 3 hepatic phases were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis. RESULT(S): The mean radiation dose and the contrast medium dose were significantly lower under protocols B and C than under protocol A. In all hepatic phases, all signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were greater under protocol C than under other protocols at all anatomic sites. Qualitative analysis showed that image noise and diagnostic acceptability were significantly higher under protocol C.

3039,"Long term radiological features of radiation-induced lung damage PURPOSE: To describe the radiological findings of radiation-induced lung damage (RILD) present on CT imaging of lung cancer patients 12months after radical chemoradiation., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Baseline and 12-month CT scans of 33 patients were reviewed from a phase I/II clinical trial of isotoxic chemoradiation (IDEAL CRT). CT findings were scored in three categories derived from eleven sub-categories: (1) parenchymal change, defined as the presence of consolidation, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), traction bronchiectasis and/or reticulation; (2) lung volume reduction, identified through reduction in lung height and/or distortions in fissures, diaphragm, anterior junction line and major airways anatomy, and (3) pleural changes, either thickening and/or effusion., RESULTS: Six patients were excluded from the analysis due to anatomical changes caused by partial lung collapse and abscess. All remaining 27 patients had radiological evidence of lung damage. The three categories, parenchymal change, shrinkage and pleural change were present in 100%, 96% and 82% respectively. All patients had at least two categories of change present and 72% all three. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were present in 44%, 52% and 37% of patients., CONCLUSIONS: Parenchymal change, lung shrinkage and pleural change are present in a high proportion of patients and are frequently identified in RILD.

942,"Application of Mixed Reality Using Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays in Transforaminal Percutaneous Endoscopic Lumbar Discectomy Purpose. Mixed reality (MixR) technology merges the real and virtual worlds to produce new environments and visualizations; it is being tested for numerous minimally invasive surgical procedures. This study is aimed at evaluating the use of MixR technology using optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) during transforaminal percutaneous endoscopic discectomy (TPED). Methods. Forty-four patients treated with MixR-assisted TPED through OST-HMDs were compared with matched patients treated with conventional TPED (n=43). In the MixR-assisted TPED group, MixR technology was used to navigate the four procedures of marking, needle insertion, foraminoplasty, and positioning of the working sheath. The clinical outcomes were evaluated based on the numerical rating scale (NRS) scores and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) on preoperative and postoperative day 1 and at the last follow-up examination. The procedural times, radiation exposure, and eye fatigue were also recorded. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. Results. The NRS scores and ODI were significantly improved in both groups at the last follow-up visit compared with the preoperative values (P<0.05); these values were not statistically different between the groups. The operation time and radiation exposure during marking, needle insertion, and total procedure significantly decreased in the MixR-assisted TPED group compared to those in the conventional TPED group (P<0.05). Unfortunately, the incidence of eye fatigue increased owing to the use of OST-HMDs in the MixR-assisted TPED group. Conclusion. This study shows the utility of MixR technology for image guidance in conventional TPED. Radiation exposure is decreased, and this technology serves as a valuable tool during the TPED procedure; however, the assistance of conventional fluoroscopy is still required.

57,"Failure patterns relative to radiation treatment fields for stage II-IV thymoma INTRODUCTION: The optimal radiation therapy (RT) field design for thymomas remains unclear. Here we report the failure patterns in stage II-IV thymoma after RT at two tertiary referral centers, classified according to the new International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group definitions. METHOD(S): We reviewed 156 stage II-IV patients with thymoma treated with definitive (n=24) or adjuvant (n=132) RT. All RT was delivered without elective nodal irradiation (median dose 5040 cGy). Intrathoracic failures were classified as (1) in-field failures (within 100% isodose line [IDL]), (2) marginal recurrences (<100% and >=50% IDL), and (3) out-of-field failures (outside the 50% IDL). RESULT(S): The median follow-up was 61 months. Surgical margins were positive in 39%. The median tumor size was 9 cm. The 5-year cumulative incidence of all intrathoracic failures was 24% (n=34). Failures occurred within the RT field (n=5), marginally (n=1), out-of-field (n=22), and synchronously in- and out-of-field (n=6). The 5-year cumulative incidence of in-field failures was 7%. These were associated with Masaoka stage and tumor size. Macroscopically positive margins were associated with more local failures. Intrathoracic failures occurred most commonly in the pleural space (n=29) and lymph nodes (n=9). Patients with more advanced stage, and those treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy had more intrathoracic failures. RT dose and chemotherapy did not impact failure patterns. CONCLUSION(S): Although there were few in-field failures in patients who received RT for stage II-IV thymomas, a high rate of out-of-field intrathoracic failures still occurred. Further study is necessary to identify treatment approaches that prevent pleural recurrences. Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded

1080,"Magnitude of luminance modulation specifies amplitude of perceived movement A compelling impression of movement, which is perceptually indistinguishable from a real displacement, can be elicited by patterns containing no spatially displaced elements. An apparent oscillation, w-movement, was generated by a stationary pattern containing a large number of horizontal pairs of spatially adjacent dots modulated in brightness. The observer's task was to adjust the perceived amplitude of the w-motion to match the amplitude of a real oscillation. All of the data can be accounted for by a simple rule: If the relative change in the luminance, W = delta L/L, between two adjacent stationary dots is kept constant, the distance over which these dots appeared to travel in space comprises a fixed fraction of the total distance by which they are separated. The apparent amplitude of the w-motion increases strictly in proportion with luminance contrast, provided that the contrast is represented in the motion-encoding system by a rapidly saturating compressive Weibull transformation. These findings can be explained in terms of bilocal motion encoders comparing two luminance modulations occurring at two different locations.",Excluded
1098,"Breaking bad: Chromothripsis and malignancy in CNS tumors Chromothripsis is a relatively novel form of genomic instability reported in a wide range of neoplasms [1, 2] and refers to shattering of a chromosome or part of a chromosome with subsequent segmental gene rearrangements in large numbers. It is currently thought to represent a single catastrophic breakage event leading to additional tumorigenesis. This is in contradistinction to the more well-delineated forms of genomic instability characterized by incremental changes. The mechanism by which chromothripsis occurs is not well understood; ionizing radiation, telomere dysfunction, abortive apoptosis, replication stress, and mitotic compaction of incompletely replicated chromosomes have been posited as potential triggers [2]. Generally, chromothripsis is linked to poorer prognosis [1]. With increased availability of advanced cytogenomic molecular assays, and growing recognition of the importance of molecular and genomic classification particularly of central nervous system neoplasms, an ever-increasing amount of molecular data becomes available. Here we report on a group of CNS neoplasms (primary and metastatic) in which cytogenomic analysis revealed chromothripsis. This cohort consists of 9 cases identified over a 7-month period. All cases were considered high-grade malignant neoplasms. Six of the cases (67%) represented primary CNS neoplasms consisting of glioblastoma (4), anaplastic pilocytic astrocytoma (1), and an atypical meningioma (1). The remaining cases (3) were metastases: melanoma, uterine sarcoma, and lung adenocarcinoma. The age range of patients affected was 27 to 80 years old with a median age of 57. Five of the nine patients (56%) were male, and 4 patients (44%) had passed away already at the time of this study, with a median survival of 4.5 months after surgery. Of note, all but one (89%) of the total patients had received radiation therapy prior to biopsy.

Radiological end result (intraarticular steps, gaps, arthrosis), subjective complaints, mobility of the elbow joint and muscle strength were evaluated. Patients with an unstable elbow (Mayo classification Type III and Schatzker-Schmeling classification Type D) had a higher loss of elbow function than others. There was a correlation between fracture morphology (fractures Type C and Type D in the Schatzker-Schmeling classification) and arthrosis. There also was a correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis and arthrosis. There was no correlation between suboptimal osteosynthesis, implant loosening and secondary procedures. Patients more often expressed subjective complaints and loss of function in activities of daily life before than after metal removal. Primary elbow instability and fracture morphology are prognostic factors for elbow function and development of arthrosis after operative treatment of olecranon fractures. We, therefore, recommend the classification systems of the Mayo-clinic or of Schatzker-Schmeling. As many patients have complaints related to the implants, we recommend metal removal after fracture healing. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
721,"Radiation-induced bystander effects in vivo are sex specific Ionizing radiation (IR) effects span beyond the area of direct exposure and can be observed in neighboring and distant naive cells and organs. This phenomenon is termed a 'bystander effect'. IR effects in directly exposed tissue in vivo are epigenetically mediated and distinct in males and females. Yet, IR-induced bystander effects have never been explored in a sex-specificity domain. We used an in vivo mouse model, whereby the bystander effects are studied in spleen of male and female animals subjected to head exposure when the rest of the body is protected by a medical-grade lead shield. We analyzed the induction of DNA damage and alterations in global DNA methylation. Molecular parameters were correlated with cellular proliferation and apoptosis levels. The changes observed in bystander organs are compared to the changes in unexposed animals and animals exposed to predicted and measured scatter doses. We have found the selective induction of DNA damage levels, global DNA methylation, cell proliferation and apoptosis in exposed and bystander spleen tissue of male and female mice. Sex differences were significantly diminished in animals subjected to a surgical removal of gonads. These data constitute the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced bystander effects in mouse spleen in vivo. We show the role of sex hormones in spleen bystander responses and discuss implications of the observed changes.",Included
3252,"Lymphopenia During Definitive Chemoradiotherapy in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Association with Dosimetric Parameters and Patient Outcomes Background: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, as well as dosimetric parameters, and the risk of treatment-related lymphopenia in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical characteristics and dosimetric parameters were collected from 436 patients with ESCC who received definitive CRT from 2010 through 2017. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) were obtained before, during, and 1 month after CRT. Grade 4 (G4) lymphopenia was defined as ALC <0.2 x 109/L during CRT. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the effect of each factor on predicting G4 lymphopenia. The relationship between lymphopenia and overall survival (OS) was examined, and a nomogram was developed to predict OS. Result(s): G4 lymphopenia was observed in 103 patients (23.6%) during CRT. Multivariate analysis indicated that planning target volume (PTV), lung V10, heart V10, performance status, and pretreatment lymphopenia were significant risk factors for G4 lymphopenia. Patients with G4 lymphopenia had significantly worse survival than those without. Based on multivariate analysis, clinical TNM stage, radiotherapy modality, pretreatment ALC, and G4 lymphopenia were predictive of OS and were incorporated into the nomogram, yielding a concordance index of 0.71. Conclusion(s): G4 lymphopenia during definitive CRT was associated with larger PTVs, higher lung V10 and heart V10, and worse survival. Implications for Practice: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between clinical characteristics, as well as dosimetric parameters, and the risk of treatment-related lymphopenia in 436 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Grade 4 (G4) lymphopenia was observed in 23.6% of patients during radiotherapy. G4 lymphopenia was associated with larger planning target volumes, higher lung V10 and heart V10, and worse survival. Then, a nomogram was built based on multivariate analysis, yielding excellent performance to predict overall survival. Prospective studies are needed to investigate potential approaches for mitigating severe lymphopenia, which may ultimately convert into survival benefits.Copyright © AlphaMed Press 2020",Excluded
2112,"Chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone following induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with stage iii lung cancer Purpose: It is unclear whether adding concurrent chemotherapy (CT) to definitive radiotherapy (RT) following induction CT is a tolerable and cost effective treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients aged 70 years or older with comorbidities. This study evaluated the actual clinical outcomes between concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and RT alone following induction CT or not in patients (>=70 years) in a single institution's clinical practice. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 82 patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC between 2004 and 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Their treatment tolerance and clinical outcomes such as overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence (LRR), treatment toxicities and distant metastasis (DM) were evaluated. Early mortality rates were also evaluated as 4-month mortality after RT. Result(s): Fifty-four patients received CCRT and 28 patients received RT alone. Induction CT before RT was performed for 68.5% and 50.0% in CCRT and RT alone groups. Treatment tolerance was significantly worse in CCRT (p = 0.046). The median survival was 21.1 and 18.1 months for CCRT and RT alone, which was not statistically significant. LRR and DM were also not different. Most early deaths after CCRT were attributed to non-cancer-related mortality. Acute esophagitis of grade >=2 occurred more following CCRT (p = 0.017). In multivariate analysis, a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of >=5 and a weight loss of >=5% after RT were associated with poor OS. The factors adversely affecting 4-month survival were a CCI of >=5 and CCRT. Conclusion(s): There were no significant differences in OS, LRR, and DM between CCRT and RT alone treatment in elderly patients. However, there was a poorer tolerance and higher incidence of acute esophagitis in the CCRT group. Specifically, when the patients had a CCI of >=5, RT alone seems to be reasonable with a low probability of early death.Copyright © 2019. The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
1203,"The features of bone metabolism in patients with periodontal diseases Background The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between bone metabolic disturbances and periodontal diseases Objectives Several studies discuss the relationship between systemic bone mineral density (BMD) and periodontal diseases. Osteoporosis or low systemic BMD should be considered as the risk factor for periodontal disease progression. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of bone metabolism on the periodontal status in the patients. Methods The study included 89 patients (38 men and 51 women, mean age - 43.5+/-5.1 years) with the healthy periodontal status (HPS) and 231 patients (108 men and 123 women, mean age - 45.6+/-5.2 years) with generalized periodontitis (GP). Clinical conditions of periodontal tissue and radiographic determinations (panoramic X-Ray) were evaluated. Skeletal systemic BMD was measured by DXA. Metabolic processes of bone tissue were evaluated by bone turnover markers: bone tissue formation - osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) in serum and bone tissue resorption marker - deoxypiridinoline (DPD) in urine. Results Comparative analysis of structural and functional state of bone tissue in patients showed a mineral density reduction in GP group compared to HPS, but these changes were not statistically significant. Disorders of bone tissue metabolism and dissociation in the processes of bone tissue remodeling were determined in patients with GP. The OC level in the patients with GP (18.89+/-0.87 ng/ml in men and 20.39+/-1.14 ng/ml in women) was statistically significantly (p<0.01) lower compared to the HPS group (24.14+/-1.04 ng/ml in men and 27.56+/-1.12 ng/ml in women). BAP show significant differences between groups. The level of DPD in the GP group (5.78+/-0.79 mmol in men, 8.34+/-0.56 mmol in women) was significantly higher (p<0.01) compared to HPS group (3.57+/-1.12 mmol in men, 4.47+/-0.76 mmol in women). Conclusions These results suggest that periodontitis associations with bone metabolic disturbances. In patients with periodontitis unbalanced bone remodeling was found: decreased bone formation and increased resorption.",Excluded
3375,"Possible involvement of the facial nucleus in regulation of respiration in rats The facial nucleus (FN) has been known as a motor nucleus to control the activity of the facial skeletal muscles by its efferent somatic motoneurons. Much less, however, is known about the non-motor control functions of its interneurons. The present study was designed to investigate if the interneurons of the FN participate in controlling rhythmic respiration in the sodium thiopental-anesthetized and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats with facial motoneurons retrogradely degenerated with techniques of electrical and chemical stimulation of the FN and extracellular recording of discharge of neurons in the FN. Single pulse stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms) of the FN during inspiration caused a transient restrain in phrenic discharge. Short train stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms, 100 Hz, 3-5 pulses) delivered during the early- or mid-term of inspiration augmented the inspiratory duration, but switched the inspiration off when delivered during the later stage of inspiration. Short train stimulation delivered during expiration prolonged the expiratory duration. Continuous stimulation could inhibit the inspiration. Microinjection of kainic acid into the FN caused an augmentation in inspiratory duration and amplitude and in expiratory duration. These data indicate that the interneurons of the FN might participate in the modulation of respiration. Different discharge patterns of interneurons in the FN, interestingly some respiratory related patterns, were observed, which provide a possible structural basis for the role of the FN in respiratory regulation.",Excluded
1163,"Asesment of lymphoid neoplasm risk factors in people ocupationaly exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation Objective: To estimate the incidence of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue (MNLT) among employees of the Siberian Chemical Combine (SC) occupationally exposed to prolonged ionizing radiation. Material and Methods. The study included 44,041 employees of the SC, of whom 16,938 were occupationally exposed to prolonged low-intensity ionizing radiation (IR). Of 295 cases with hemoblastoses, there were 89 with occupational exposure to IR. The structure and incidence of hemoblastoses (based on the number of person-years of observation, (PYO), as well as the standardized relative risk (SRR) of their development and excess relative risk (ERR) per unit dose of radiation (Gr) were evaluated. Calculation of SRR was carried out for the following intervals of the total dose of external exposure: 0; >0-0.05; >0.05-0.10; >0.10-0.15; >0.15-0.20; >0.20-0.30; >0.30-0.50; >0.5-1.0; >= 1.0 G y. The control group consisted of occupationally non-exposed employees of the SC. The calculation of SRR and ERR was performed using the Poisson regression using the AM FIT module of the EPICU RE package. Results. The incidence of MNLT among males of SC was 17.1 per 100,000 P YO, with the highest incidence rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CL) and chronic leukemia (CL) excluding CL. Among females of the SC, the incidence of MNLT was 21.3 per 100,000 PYO. It was found that in none of the intervals of the external exposure there was no statistically significant excess of the SRR compared with the control group. The results of ERR/Gy calculation also did not demonstrate the increased risk of hemoblastosis among people occupationally exposed to IR. Conclusion. Occupational exposure in the studied dose range does not increase the risk of developing MNLT.Copyright © 2020, Tomsk National Research Medical Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

193,"Sex-specific radiation-induced microRNAome responses in the hippocampus, cerebellum and frontal cortex in a mouse model Ionizing radiation is an important treatment modality, but it is also a well-known genotoxic agent capable of damaging cells and tissues. Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome. We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males. We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",Included
84,"Late complications after high-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for tongue cancer Objectives. To analyze the treatment results and late complications of high-dose-rate (HDR) interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) for early (T1N0, T2N0) mobile tongue cancer using the microSelectron-HDR. Methods. From January 1993 through April 2001, a total of 72 patients with early squamous cell carcinomas of the mobile tongue were treated with microSelectron-HDR interstitial brachytherapy at the Department of Radiology, Osaka University Hospital. Of the patients, 18% were treated with a combination of prior external radiation and HDR-ISBT, and 82% were treated with HDR-ISBT alone. For HDR-ISBT alone, all cases were treated with a total dose of 54 Gy/9 fractions every 5 days or 60 Gy/10 fractions every 8 days. In combined therapy with an external dose of 30 to 40 Gy, HDR-ISBT was given at a total dose of 42-50 Gy. The Brinkman and alcohol indexes were used to analyze the incidence of late complications after HDR-ISBT. Results. The 2- and 5-year local control rates were 85% and 82%, respectively. Fifteen of 72 patients (21%) treated with HDR-ISBT had late complications. Ten of 15 patients (67%) with late complications had a Brinkman index exceeding 600. Conclusions. HDR-ISBT is useful and easily applied under local anesthesia to early or superficial lesions of the mobile tongue. However, we found an increase in late complications, such as soft-tissue ulcers and bone exposure, after irradiation of tongue cancer with 60 Gy HDR-ISBT in patients with a Brinkman index greater than 600. © Japanese Society for Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Springer-Verlag Tokyo 2005.",Excluded
489,"CT urography in the urinary bladder: to compare excretory phase images using a low noise index and a high noise index with adaptive noise reduction filter BACKGROUND: Although CT urography (CTU) is widely used for the evaluation of the entire urinary tract, the most important drawback is the radiation exposure., PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of a noise reduction filter (NRF) using a phantom and to quantitatively and qualitatively compare excretory phase (EP) images using a low noise index (NI) with those using a high NI and postprocessing NRF (pNRF)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Each NI value was defined for a slice thickness of 5 mm, and reconstructed images with a slice thickness of 1.25 mm were assessed. Sixty patients who were at high risk of developing bladder tumors (BT) were divided into two groups according to whether their EP images were obtained using an NI of 9.88 (29 patients; group A) or an NI of 20 and pNRF (31 patients; group B). The CT dose index volume (CTDI(vol)) and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the bladder with respect to the anterior pelvic fat were compared in both groups. Qualitative assessment of the urinary bladder for image noise, sharpness, streak artifacts, homogeneity, and the conspicuity of polypoid or sessile-shaped BTs with a short-axis diameter greater than 10 mm was performed using a 3-point scale., RESULTS: The phantom study showed noise reduction of approximately 40% and 76% dose reduction between group A and group B. CTDI(vol) demonstrated a 73% reduction in group B (4.6 +/- 1.1 mGy) compared with group A (16.9 +/- 3.4 mGy). The CNR value was not significantly different (P = 0.60) between group A (16.1 +/- 5.1) and group B (16.6 +/- 7.6). Although group A was superior (P < 0.01) to group B with regard to image noise, other qualitative analyses did not show significant differences., CONCLUSION: EP images using a high NI and pNRF were quantitatively and qualitatively comparable to those using a low NI, except with regard to image noise.",Excluded
2976,"Persistence of chromatid aberrations in the cells of solid mouse tissues exposed to 137Cs gamma radiation Primary mouse ear and kidney cultures were established for determination of cytogenetic aberrations at short (3 days to 1 month) and long (12-23 months) times after exposure of their right sides to 7.5 Gy of (137)Cs gamma radiation. In every case, higher levels of aberrations were observed in primary cultures established from the irradiated tissues than in those established from the contralateral tissues. The most common aberrations in the contralateral tissues and those from nonirradiated mice were chromatid and isochromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments. Primary cells from irradiated tissues removed from animals within a month of exposure displayed a variety of unstable chromosome-type aberrations characteristic of recent exposure to ionizing radiation including rings, dicentrics, double minutes, and large acentric fragments. The percentages of cells exhibiting chromatid breaks and small chromatid fragments were also markedly elevated. Although the levels of chromosome-type aberrations found in primary cells from irradiated tissues dropped to near background levels a year or more after exposure, chromatid-type aberrations remained elevated. These results are consistent with long-term persistence of damage in the genomes of ionizing radiation-exposed cells in solid tissues and the induction of genomic instability in vivo.",Included

Progesterone receptor immunoreactivity was detected in 70% of tumors. Estrogen receptor immunoreactivity was not detected. An inverse correlation was found between detection of progesterone receptors and the PFPCNA index. The overall 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 68%. The only prognostic factor that significantly affected PFS rate was the PFPCNA index. The 2-year PFS was 42% for tumors with a high PFPCNA index (value > or = 24%) and 91% for tumors with a low PFPCNA index (value < 24%). Tumors with a high PFPCNA index were 9.1 times as likely to recur as were tumors with a low PFPCNA index., CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study confirms the value of irradiation for dogs with incompletely resected meningiomas. Prognostic value of the PFPCNA index suggests-that duration of treatment and interval from surgery to start of irradiation may affect outcome. Loss of progesterone receptors in some tumors may be responsible for an increase in PFPCNA index and may indirectly affect prognosis after radiation therapy.",Included

For patients in the LDR group (n = 341), the treatment sources consisted of Ir-192 pin for 227 patients (1973-1996; irradiated dose, 61-85 Gy; median, 70 Gy), Ra-226 needle for 113 patients (1967-1986; 55-93 Gy; median, 70 Gy). Ra-226 and Ir-192 were combined for one patient. Ir-192 HDR (microSelectron-HDR) was used for 58 patients in the HDR group (1991-present; 48-60 Gy; median, 60 Gy). LDR implantations were performed via oral and HDR via a submental/submandibular approach. The dose rates at the reference point for the LDR group were 0.30 to 0.8 Gy/h, and for the HDR group 1.0 to 3.4 Gy/min. The patients in the HDR group received a total dose of 48-60 Gy (8-10 fractions) during one week. Two fractions were administered per day (at least a 6-h interval). The 3- and 5-year local control rates for patients in the LDR group were 85% and 80%, respectively, and those in the HDR group were both 84%. HDR brachytherapy showed the same lymph-node control rate as did LDR brachytherapy (67% at 5 years). HDR brachytherapy achieved the same locoregional result as did LDR brachytherapy.

2889,"Prevention and Management of Radiation-induced Late Gastrointestinal Toxicity In the UK, about 90,000 cancer survivors will suffer from pelvic radiation disease (PRD) due to their curative treatment including radiotherapy. The National Cancer Survivorship Initiative aims to improve the understanding and management of PRD by the oncology community. This overview covers the prevention, investigation and treatment for late radiation-induced gastrointestinal symptoms in PRD. Multiple pharmacological and nutritional interventions have been studied, as prophylaxis for acute gastrointestinal toxicity (aiming to prevent late consequential effects), although predominantly only small randomised controlled trials have been conducted. These have produced mixed results, although promising signals for some agents have been observed. Evidence for the pharmacological prevention of late gastrointestinal toxicity is scarce. Even fewer randomised controlled trials have investigated the late gastrointestinal toxicity profile of advanced radiotherapy technologies. There are nationally agreed algorithms for the investigation and management of PRD, but a lack of awareness means patients still do not get referred appropriately. This overview outlines the management of radiation proctopathy and diarrhoea, and signposts other accessible resources. Finally, we provide recommendations for the management of late gastrointestinal symptoms in PRD and research in this field, especially the need for high-quality clinical trials.

271,"Increased lung cancer risk due to residential radon in a pooled and extended analysis of studies in Germany Residential radon has been shown to be a risk factor for lung cancer in several studies-but with limited power in each single study. The data of two case-control studies performed during 1990-1997 in Germany and used for previous publications have been extended and pooled. Both studies have identical study designs. In total, data of 2,963 incident lung cancer cases and 4,232 population controls are analyzed here. One-year radon measurements were performed in houses occupied during the 5-35 y prior to the interview. Conditional logistic and linear relative risk regression was used for the analysis. Measurements covered on average 70% of the exposure time window, with an average radon exposure of 61 Bq m(-3). The smoking and asbestos-adjusted ORs were 0.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 1.11] for 50-80 Bq m(-3), 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.30) for 80-140 Bq m(-3) and 1.40 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.89) for radon concentrations above 140 Bq m(-3), compared to the reference category <50 Bq m(-3). The linear increase in the odds ratio per 100 Bq m(-3) was 0.10 (95% CI -0.02 to 0.30) for all subjects and 0.14 (95% CI -0.03 to 0.55) for less mobile subjects who lived in only one home in the last 5-35 y. The risk coefficients generally were higher when measurement error in the radon concentrations was reduced by restricting the population. With respect to histopathology, the risk for small cell carcinoma was higher than for other subtypes.

342,"Malignant melanoma risk by nativity, place of residence at diagnosis, and age at migration Although geographic latitude is clearly linked to the risk of cutaneous malignant melanoma, the chronology of this link is unclear. Based on the 4,611 cases of melanoma with known place of nativity diagnosed in 1972-82 among the non-Latino White residents of Los Angeles County (California, United States) of known place of origin, migrants to Los Angeles from higher US latitudes enjoy relative safety from skin melanoma. This relative safety is largely unaffected by the interval since migration, even after decades of residence in Los Angeles. The same relative protection is enjoyed by native residents of more northerly US communities in comparison with co-resident migrants from the southwestern US. While the observed effect of latitude is consistent with the accepted importance of solar radiation as a determinant of melanoma risk, it suggests that early, rather than late or cumulative, exposure is of most importance. This finding does not affirm the belief that protection of adult skin from exposure to the sun will reduce the risk from melanoma. It does suggest that decades must pass before it will be possible to assess the impact on melanoma risk of any increase in ultraviolet radiation delivered to the earth as a result of the destruction of atmospheric ozone.",Excluded
3183,"Individually adapted examination protocols for reduction of radiation exposure in chest CT RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple directive for the reduction of radiation exposure without loss of diagnostic information in routine chest CT examinations., METHODS: Two hundred fifty adult patients (164 male, 86 female) were entered into a prospective trial. All examinations were performed with a multislice CT technique (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens). Four groups of 50 patients each were scanned with patient-related specific parameters: individual mA-s values were derived from the estimated body weight: kilograms + 10, +/- 0, - 10, and - 20 mAs. The results were compared with those of 50 patients who were examined by a standard chest protocol by using the parameters 120 mAs and 140 kV. All other parameters including the tube voltage were kept constant. Subjective image quality was rated on a three-point scale: 1 = excellent, 2 = fair, 3 = nondiagnostic. In addition, objective criteria based on signal-to-noise measurements were assessed by using a region-of-interest methodology., RESULTS: Image quality was sufficient in all cases. Mean subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft-tissue window settings, were 1.1 for the 120-mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] + 10) mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] +/- 0) mAs protocol, 1.3 for the (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs protocol, and 1.2 for the (body weight [kg] - 20) mAs protocol. Objective criteria based on noise measurements showed mean +/- standard deviation values of 5.7 +/- 0.8 Hounsfield units (HU) for the 120-mAs protocol. For the reduced-dose protocols, values were calculated as 7.6 +/- 1.2 HU (group + 10), 7.9 +/- 1.3 HU (group +/- 0), 8.7 +/- 1.2 HU (group - 10), and finally 9.1 +/- 1.3 HU (group - 20). The best correlation for an entire subgroup was achieved with the - 10 protocol (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs, with nearly constant noise related to body weight in all patients., CONCLUSIONS: By deriving mAs values from body weight estimation, an individually adapted protocol for chest CT can be recommended and easily employed in a clinical setting. With an adaptation of the tube current-time product based on the estimated body weight of the patient - 10 (body weight [kg] - 10 mAs), a well-balanced examination without significant loss of information, even in soft-tissue window settings, can be performed with this particular scanner. For this adapted mAs protocol, a mean reduction of radiation exposure of 45% was achievable, compared with the standard protocol. A maximum decrease per case down to 31 mAs was obtained, without relevant loss of image quality. Therefore, for other types of CT scanners, analogous protocols may be adapted.",Excluded
2370,"Characteristics of High-Performing Radiologists Within Medicare Quality Programs Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess radiologists' performance on Medicare quality measures and identify physician characteristics potentially influencing such scores. Method(s): Medicare quality scores reported by US radiologists in 2015 were obtained from CMS. Associations were explored with publicly available physician characteristic data. Result(s): Overall, 15,045 radiologists reported 40,427 Medicare quality scores encompassing 25 claims measures, 18 registry measures, and 2 qualified clinical data registry (QCDR) measures. Claims measures included reporting fluoroscopic times (n = 10,152; mean score, 80.3 +/- 27.6), carotid ultrasound stenosis (n = 8,940; mean score, 86.8 +/- 20.6), inappropriate mammography use of ""probably benign"" (n = 8,083; mean score, 0.4 +/- 3.3), mammography reminders (n = 7,229; mean score, 86.6 +/- 29.0), bone scintigraphy correlation (n = 2,712; mean score, 76.0 +/- 27.0), and line-related infection prevention (n = 2,226; mean score, 83.3 +/- 27.4). Registry measures were reported by <=17 radiologists. The two QCDR measures were dose index registry participation (n = 246; mean score, 99.5 +/- 1.4) and mammography recall rate (n = 77; mean score, 9.0 +/- 5.6). Higher scores were observed for radiologists in larger practices (strongest independent predictor), in subspecialized practices, in academic practices, in the South and West, and with fewer years in practice. The fluoroscopic exposure times measure had the best performance scores by musculoskeletal and interventional radiologists, carotid Doppler measure by abdominal radiologists, mammography measures by breast radiologists, bone scintigraphy measure by musculoskeletal and nuclear medicine radiologists, and line infection measure by interventionalists. The dose registry participation QCDR measure had near perfect performance across generalists and subspecialists. Conclusion(s): Current Medicare performance metrics favor radiologists in larger practices and subspecialized radiologists, possibly reflecting support infrastructures and the narrow focus of most metrics, respectively. These findings may assist targeted data-driven reporting by radiologists and guide efforts to refine existing and develop new metrics.Copyright © 2018 American College of Radiology",Excluded

2145,"Repeat Gamma Knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: long-term results The purpose of this study was to assess the long-term outcome achieved after repeat Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) using a uniform treatment plan. Between 1985 and 2010, 53 patients underwent repeat GKS for refractory TN. In the initial GKS, which involved targeting the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve, a maximal dose of 80 Gy was used with a 4-mm collimator so that the 50% isodose line abutted the pons. In the second GKS, the treatment plan consisted of a 70-Gy dose directed at a target 4-5 mm distal to the first target on the trigeminal nerve. The mean follow-up duration in these patients was 42 months. Outcomes were defined using the Marseille scale: excellent (Class I or II, no pain with or without medications), good (Class III or IV, >= 50% relief), and poor (Class V, < 50% relief). Trigeminal neuralgia pain was controlled (>= 50% improvement with or without medications) after repeat GKS in 70% of patients at 1 year, 50% at 3 years, 50% at 5 years, and 50% at 10 years, as defined by a Kaplan-Meier analysis. A correlation was found between facial numbness and pain relief (p = 0.047). No difference was found between patients with Type 1 TN and those with Type 2 TN, and there was no correlation between the best relief obtained and long-term durability of relief from pain. Twenty-two patients (47.8%) described their trigeminal dysfunction in the following manner: numbness (45.6%), dry eye (10.9%), taste change (8.7%), or jaw weakness (2.2%). In only 8.7% of cases did the patient experience facial numbness that was regarded as bothersome. Repeat GKS for TN at the doses used provides substantial long-term relief. Treatment failure occurred up to 28 months after the second GKS. Facial numbness correlated with more durable pain relief after repeat GKS in this series.",Excluded
2295,"Radiotherapy in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices: clinical and dosimetric aspects As a result of aging, the number of patients with cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) requiring radiotherapy (RT) continues to rise. The aim of this work was to evaluate RT-related malfunctions of CIED in a cohort of patients who underwent RT in our clinic from June 2010 to December 2016. We retrospectively analyzed 93 RT treatments in 63 patients with CIEDs. Patients were treated with 3D conformal RT, intensity-modulated RT and stereotactic RT. We collected clinical characteristics of cancer, models of CIEDs, total RT dose to tumor and radiation energy. Radiation dose delivered to CIED and its dysfunctions after RT was evaluated. Subgroup analysis of 48 RT treatments (32 patients) on chest and neck plus on 13 RT treatments (12 patients) with 18 MV neutron-producing photon energy considered as high risk was performed. The number of treatments of patients with CIEDs increased from 0.3% in 2011 to 1.2% in 2016. Two patients, treated with 18 MV photon beam, with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that received a maximum dose of around 2.1 Gy, experienced adverse events: a reprogramming of ICD when the patient reached a delivered dose to the tumor of 32 Gy, and an altered sensing function requiring replacement after 11 months from the end of RT. Nearly 2% of patients with CIEDs from high-risk patients subgroup had experienced a damage of the device. Close cooperation between radiation oncologists, cardiologists, medical physicists and radiation technologists is needed to achieve the best practice management in these patients.Copyright © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3156,"Effects of Proton Pump Inhibitors on the Small Bowel and Stool Microbiomes Background: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is extremely common. PPIs have been suggested to affect the gut microbiome, and increase risks of Clostridium difficile infection and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, existing data are based on stool analyses and PPIs act on the foregut. Aim(s): To compare the duodenal and stool microbiomes in PPI and non-PPI users. Method(s): Consecutive subjects presenting for upper endoscopy without colonoscopy were recruited. Current antibiotic users were excluded. Subjects taking PPI were age- and gender-matched 1:2 to non-PPI controls. Subjects completed medical history questionnaires, and duodenal aspirates were collected using a validated protected catheter. A subset also provided stool samples. Duodenal and stool microbiomes were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Result(s): The duodenal microbiome exhibited no phylum-level differences between PPI (N = 59) and non-PPI subjects (N = 118), but demonstrated significantly higher relative abundances of families Campylobacteraceae (3.13-fold, FDR P value < 0.01) and Bifidobacteriaceae (2.9-fold, FDR P value < 0.01), and lower relative abundance of Clostridiaceae (88.24-fold, FDR P value < 0.0001), in PPI subjects. SIBO rates were not significantly different between groups, whether defined by culture (> 103 CFU/ml) or 16S sequencing, nor between subjects taking different PPIs. The stool microbiome exhibited significantly higher abundance of family Streptococcaceae (2.14-fold, P = 0.003), and lower Clostridiaceae (2.60-fold, FDR P value = 8.61E-13), in PPI (N = 22) versus non-PPI (N = 47) subjects. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PPI use is not associated with higher rates of SIBO. Relative abundance of Clostridiaceae was reduced in both the duodenal and stool microbiomes, and Streptococcaceae was increased in stool. The clinical implications of these findings are unknown.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
2745,"A modified method of shell windowing for producing somatic or germline chimeras in fertilized chicken eggs Stage X chick blastoderms following oviposition were accessed via a small window in the egg. Windowing, however, substantially reduces the hatchability of eggs containing early embryos. For example, only 32 of 389 (8.2%) eggs hatched after standard windowing with or without irradiation or injection. Ex ovo culture systems can overcome this problem but are labor intensive. A modification of a standard windowing technique has yielded an average hatch rate of 32% for 892 windowed eggs independent of incubator type, gamma-irradiation, or injection of the embryo. This was a fourfold increase over a standard windowing method. Similar hatch rates were observed using fertile eggs from five chicken lines [Barred Plymouth Rock (BR), Athens-Canadian (AC), Line 0, SPAFAS, and commercial White Leghorns (WL)]. The modification involves covering the egg shell membrane with PBS after grinding away the shell and before piercing the membrane. The window is then sealed by overlaying with fresh shell membrane and cementing it in place once it has dried. The method has been used successfully for the production of somatic and germline chimeras because donor BR blastodermal cells injected into Stage X, gamma-irradiated recipient embryos from WL or AC yielded a hatch of 33.7%, of which 42.3% were feather chimeras. Two of 11 cockerels tested were germline mosaics bearing at least 1% BR sperm. The modified windowing technique may be broadly applicable in emerging technologies in avian transgenesis and development.",Excluded
2397,"Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes: Link with biomarkers of the CBMN cytome assay in hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of ionising radiation Individual sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) is the result of interaction between exposure, DNA damage, and its repair, which is why polymorphisms in DNA repair genes could play an important role. We examined the association between DNA damage, expressed as micronuclei (MNi), nuclear buds (NBs), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms in selected DNA repair genes (APE1, hOGG1, XRCC1, XRCC3, XPD, PARP1, MGMT genes; representative of the different DNA repair pathways operating in mammals) in 77 hospital workers chronically exposed to low doses of IR, and 70 matched controls. A significantly higher MNi frequency was found in the exposed group (16.2+/-10.4 vs. 11.5+/-9.4; P=0.003) and the effect appeared to be independent from the principal confounding factor. Exposed individuals with hOGG1, XRCC1, PARP1, and MGMT wild-type alleles or APEX1, as well as XPD (rs13181) heterozygous showed a significantly higher MNi frequency than controls with the same genotypes. Genetic polymorphism analysis and cytogenetic dosimetry have proven to be a powerful tool complementary to physical dosimetry in regular health surveillance programmes.Copyright © 2015 Institute for Medical Research and Occupational Health.",Included
1569,"Addition of Astatine-211-Labeled Anti-CD45 Antibody to TBI as Conditioning for DLA-Identical Marrow Transplantation: A Novel Strategy to Overcome Graft Rejection in a Canine Presensitization Model: ""Radioimmunotherapy to Overcome Transfusion-Induced Sensitization"" In a canine model of presensitization using donor blood transfusions, 100% of historical control dogs receiving 9.2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning before dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical marrow grafts had graft rejection. In this presensitization model, we investigated whether the addition of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based targeted radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with astatine-211 (211At) to TBI could overcome graft rejection. 211At is an alpha-particle-emitting isotope that has a short path length, very high energy, and a short t1/2 of 7.2 hours, which allowed targeting radiation to the T cells responsible for graft rejection. Normal canine recipients were given three preceding transfusions of unirradiated whole blood on days -24, -17, and -10 before transplant from their DLA-identical marrow donors. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb was administered on day -3, and TBI followed by marrow grafts on day 0. Six of the 7 dogs (86%) achieved sustained engraftment as assessed by 100% donor chimerism in mononuclear cells, granulocytes, and CD3+ T cells. One dog receiving the lowest CD34+ cell content (0.35 x 106 cells/kg) rejected the graft. There were no late rejections in dogs followed up to 1 year. Graft-versus-host disease was seen in one dog. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb in combination with TBI as conditioning was successful in abrogating graft rejection in 86% of dogs in this presensitization model. 211At-anti-CD45 mAb conditioning with TBI may serve as a novel promising strategy to overcome graft rejection in heavily transfused patients with red cell disorders.Copyright © 2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy",Excluded
384,"CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas Objective. Hemangiopericytoma is a rare and aggressive meningeal tumor. Although surgical resection is the standard treatment, hemangiopericytomas often recur with high incidences of metastasis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery (CK) in the management of recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. Methods. In a review of the Stanford radiosurgery database between 2002 and 2009, the authors found 14 patients who underwent CK therapy for recurrent, metastatic, and residual hemangiopericytomas. A total of 24 tumors were treated and the median patient age was 52 years (range 29-70 years) at the time of initial CK therapy. The median follow-up period was 37 months (10-73 months) and all patients had been previously treated with surgical resection. Mean tumor volume was 9.16 cm3 and the mean marginal and maximum radiosurgical doses to the tumors were 21.2 Gy and 26.8 Gy, respectively. Result(s): Of the 24 tumors treated, 22 have clinical follow-up data at this time. Of those 22 tumors, 12 decreased in size (54.5%), 6 remained unchanged (27.3%), and 4 showed recurrence (18.2%) after CK therapy. Progression-free survival rate was 95%, 71.5%, and 71.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after multiple CK treatments. The 5-year survival rate after CK was 81%. Conclusion(s): CK is an effective and safe management option for hemangiopericytomas. The current series demonstrates a tumor control of 81.8%.

1151,"The effects of radiation and dose-fractionation on cancer and non-tumor disease development The Janus series of radiation experiments, conducted from 1970 to 1992, explored the effects of gamma and neutron radiation on animal lifespan and disease development. Data from these experiments presents an opportunity to conduct a large scale analysis of both tumor and non-tumor disease development. This work was focused on a subset of animals from the Janus series of experiments, comparing acute or fractionated exposures of gamma or neutron radiation on the hazards associated with the development of tumor and non-tumor diseases of the liver, lung, kidney or vascular system. This study also examines how the co-occurrence of non-tumor diseases may affect tumor-associated hazards. While exposure to radiation increases the hazard of dying with tumor and non-tumor diseases, dose fractionation modulates these hazards, which varies across different organ systems. Finally, the effect that concurrent non-cancer diseases have on the hazard of dying with a tumor also differs by organ system. These results highlight the complexity in the effects of radiation on the liver, lung, kidney and vascular system.",Included
561,"Treatment outcomes of radiotherapy for tonsillar carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiotherapy Background: We performed this study to analyze treatment outcomes and to evaluate prognostic factors in patients with tonsillar carcinoma who were treated with radiotherapy (RT). Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients with tonsillar carcinoma treated with RT between January 1979 and September 2009. Of the 164 patients, 91 were treated with 2-dimensional RT (2D-RT), 46 were treated with 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), and 27 were treated with intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). When patients were treated with IMRT, simultaneous integrated boost was used. Thirty patients were treated with RT alone, 40 patients were treated with chemotherapy and RT (CRT), 66 patients were treated with surgery and RT and/or chemotherapy (SRT), and 28 patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). Bilateral neck irradiation was delivered to 141 patients, and ipsilateral neck irradiation to 23 patients. In definitive RT, median dose was 70 Gy (range, 51-71), 70 Gy (54-74), and 67.5 Gy for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. In postoperative RT, median dose was 64.8 Gy (range, 54-70.2), 66 Gy (54-70), and 63 Gy (60-67.5) for 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, and IMRT, respectively. Acute and late toxicity were graded according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group radiation morbidity scoring criteria. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 42 months (range, 2-288). The 5-year locoregional progression-free survival (LRPFS), distant metastasisfree survival (DMFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 94%, 82%, and 80%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, 5-year DFS rate was associated with the RT technique (2DRT, 77%; 3D-CRT, 82%; IMRT, 100%, p = 0.035), T stage (T1-2, 87%; T3-4, 74%, p = 0.036), and treatment modality (RT alone, 55%; CRT, 78%; SRT, 92%; CCRT, 92%, p < 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, advanced T stage and treatment modality were statistically significant prognostic factors in DFS rate. None of the patients who were treated with ipsilateral neck irradiation experienced relapse in contralateral neck nodes. After the completion of RT, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade >=2 xerostomia 91%, 58%, 59%, 35%, and 78%, respectively. At least 6 months of follow-up, patients who were treated with 2D-RT, 3D-CRT, IMRT, ipsilateral neck irradiation, and bilateral neck irradiation experienced grade <=1 xerostomia 52%, 76%, 78%, 98%, and 63%, respectively. Conclusion(s): In selected patients with well lateralized tonsillar carcinoma, ipsilateral neck irradiation can be an alternative to bilateral neck irradiation, regarding DFS rate and complications. There was no failure when patients were treated with IMRT, but long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the 72.0 Gy in 42 fractions/6 weeks). The primary endpoint was the treatment completion rate of patients who completed >= 70% of the cetuximab planned dose administration (in terms of the relative dose intensity of cetuximab) and the full dose of radiotherapy >= 2 weeks over the planned schedule (in terms of radiotherapy duration >=8 weeks). Result(s): From Mar 2009 until Jan 2010, 27 pts were screened. Of them, 22 pts were enrolled and treated (ITT population). Patients characteristics of ITT population: median age (years), 67.0 (range, 53 to 81); male/female, 21/1 pts; oropharynx/hypopharynx/larynx, 6/8/8 pts; stage III/IV, 12/10 pts. The median duration of cetuximab treatment was 7.9 weeks (range, 7 to 9), and that of RT was 44.0 days (range, 40 to 52). All 22 pts completed the treatment, and the completion rate was 100% (95% CI: 84.6%, 100.0%). The response rate (CR+PR) post RT was 81.8% (assessed by the independent committee). All pts experienced AEs. Most common AEs with grade 3/4 were mucosal inflammation (16pts, 72.7%), dermatitis (6pts, 27.3%), infection, radiation skin injury and stomatitis (each in 5 pts, 22.7%). Conclusion(s): The completion rate (100%) and the response rate (81.8%) are comparable to those of the cetuximab + RT group in the multinational randomized phase III study (Bonner et al. 2006). AEs were consistent with the underlying disease, administration of RT or cetuximab. The study results demonstrate that cetuximab + RT is well-tolerated, a feasible and efficacious treatment in Japanese pts. superiority of IMRT. Our results were not able to confirm which treatment regimen is most optimal. So, further study is needed to confirm the optimal therapeutic regimen.",Excluded
864,"Preoperative CT angiography of prospective renal transplant recipients: Evaluation of safety of iso-osmolar nonionic intravascular contrast, imaging findings, and effects on management in a predialysis patient cohort Objective: Prospective renal transplant recipients with matched living donors require careful preoperative evaluation as a result of increased risk for aortoiliac atherosclerosis and venous thrombosis in addition to an increased incidence of renal carcinoma. We investigated the safety of CT angiography (CTA) in a predialysis cohort for evaluation of arterial and venous disease and other pathology that would alter management. Material(s) and Method(s): We reviewed the records of 40 potential renal transplant recipients (24 men and 16 women; age range, 23-79 years) who were investigated with CTA performed on 64-row MDCT scanners after 100 mL Iodixanol 320 (Visipaque, GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ) IV contrast enhancement. Nonenhanced, arterial, and 2- minute delayed phase thin section (0.625-mm collimation) imaging was performed with 2-mm axial and multiplanar reconstruction, maximum intensity projection, and volume rendering angiographic reconstructions. Pre- and post-CTA serum creatinine (Se Cr) levels were obtained and clinical status observed to time of transplant or up to 7 months post- CTA. Patients underwent pre- and post-CTA hydration as allowed by individual renal status. Result(s): All patients had diagnostic quality CTA studies. Sixteen patients (40%) had major aortoiliac arterial disease that influenced transplantation management or required additional therapy. Eight patients had renal tumors, polycystic kidneys, or other tumors requiring surgical therapy. CTA necessitated additional imaging tests in seven others. Mean pre- and posttransplant Se Cr were 5.2 (range, 2.9-14.1) and 5.1 (range, 2.4-14.2) respectively. Twenty-seven patients had stable or mean decreased Se Cr of 10.2% and 13 had mean increase of 6.3% (range, +/- 32%) post-CTA. No patient required dialysis as a result of CTA. Conclusion(s): CTA with a moderate dose of Iodixanol contrast is a safe and effective procedure with no major clinical impact on renal function in this predialysis population. CTA provided arterial and venous road maps and influenced transplantation management in 40%. Other important findings led to additional surgery in 22% of the group.",Excluded

2445,"Risk factors for sexual dysfunction after rectal cancer treatment This study aimed to identify risk factors for long-term sexual dysfunction (SD) after rectal cancer treatment. Patients with resectable rectal cancer were randomised to total mesorectal excision with or without preoperative radiotherapy (PRT). Preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively, SD scores were filled out in questionnaires. Possible risk factors for postoperative deterioration of sexual functioning, including patients' demographics, tumour-specific factors and treatment-related variables, were investigated with univariate and multivariable regression analyses. Increase in general SD, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems were reported by 76.4, 79.8 and 72.2 percent of the male patients, respectively. Risk factors were nerve damage, blood loss, anastomotic leakage, PRT and the presence of a stoma. In female patients, increase in general SD, dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were reported by 61.5, 59.1 and 56.6 percent, respectively. This was associated with PRT and the presence of a stoma.

Methods and Study design: 38 patients with histologically proven muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated at our department between January 2008 and December 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Age, gender, pathology, stage, 3-year overall survival, 3-year disease-free survival, radiotherapy (RT) dose, genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity scores and response evaluation of the patients were recorded. 3-year overall survival and 3-year disease-free survivals were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method along with the analysis of gender, pathology, stage and therapy response of the study group. Result(s): 33 patients (86.8%) were managed with concomitant chemoradiotherapy whereas 5 patients (13.2%) received only radiation therapy due to renal insufficency and comorbid diseases. 6 (15.8%) out of 38 patients had partial response (PR) and remaining 32 (84.2%) patients experienced complete response (CR). The PR group underwent salvage cystectomy and CR group had been followed-up after radical radiotherapy. Mean age of the group was 70.9 (range 45-90) years. 26 of all patients were male (68.4%) and 12 were female (31.6%). Mean follow-up time after completion of radiotherapy was 24.7 months (range 12-40). Mean RT dose was 64 Gy (range 60-66). 3-year overall survival was 64% and 3-year disease free survival was 73%.

2289,"Osteoradionecrosis of the cervical vertebrae in patients irradiated for head and neck cancers Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is one of the common late adverse effects that follow radiation therapy for head and neck cancers. ORN usually develops on the mandible and less frequently on the maxilla. We present three cases of ORN of the cervical vertebrae, which is rarely reported. Two patients suffered from secondary osteomyelitis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by definitive concurrent chemoradiation therapy with a hyperfractionated and an accelerated hyperfractionated regimen, respectively. For these patients, the high intensity of treatment was considered the cause of ORN. The third patient underwent concurrent chemoradiation therapy for upper thoracic esophageal cancer and subsequently underwent endoscopic laser resection and radiation therapy for hypopharyngeal cancer. ORN developed in the area of reirradiation. In this case, an excessive radiation dose was considered the cause. ORN of cervical vertebrae, different from that of the mandible and maxilla, has a risk of radiculopathy and myelopathy. In the future, ORN of cervical vertebrae will increase because metachronous double cancers will increase and opportunities for reirradiation, in turn, will increase. To prevent this, it is necessary to optimize the treatment schedule for radiation therapy, including the total dose, fractionation, and concurrent chemotherapy, and to decrease the volume of cervical vertebrae within the irradiation field. © 2010 Japan Radiological Society.",Excluded
18,"Clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less Pillcam patency capsule for the screening of patients with suspected small bowel strictures BACKGROUND:Capsule endoscopy (CE) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the study of the small bowel. The main complication of CE is capsule retention, defined as a failure to excrete the capsule for 2 weeks or more requiring directed medical, endoscopic, or surgical intervention. Due to the risk of capsule retention, CE is contraindicated in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. The novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule (PPC) for preventing capsule retention which was marketed in 2012 in Japan has expanded the indication of small bowel disease for CE. OBJECTIVE(S):We investigated the safety and clinical usefulness of the novel tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule for preventing capsule retention in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Sixteen patients who suspected small bowel strictures were included (mean age: 66.2) in this retrospective study. If patients had already excreted the intact PPC in the stool at 30 h after ingestion of PPC, patency of the small bowel was confirmed. If the confirmation at 30 h was not successful, reconfirmation was performed by abdominal X-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) within 33 hours after the ingestion. If the intact PPC had reached to colon, we judged patency"". Except for the above-mentioned, we judged ""no patency"". If patency was established, then the patients underwent CE. RESULT(S):Male/Female (8/8). Clinical indications before the PPC were melena or hematochezia (6), abdominal pain (3), abdominal distension (2), abdominal mass (4) constipation (1), diarrhea (1), anemia (2), no abdominal symptom (4). A history of abdominal surgery +/- (4/12). A history of abdominal irradiation +/- (5/11). Fourteen cases (87.5%) had complete PPC examination followed by CE within 2 weeks. We judged 2 cases ""no patency"". Each of two cases showed the symptoms of ileus. One case needed ileus tube insertion and gastrografin enema showed stricture. In another case, gastric tube was inserted. In both cases, the ileus improved after conservative treatment. Fourteen patients underwent CE following the patency capsule examination. In 10 cases (71.4%) of them, the significant pathologic findings were found by CE. Although the confirmation of the patency by PPC was established, retention occurred in one case with asymptomatic. The patient had prior operation history of ileum-transverse colon bypass. CONCLUSION(S):Passage is a direct proof of the patency of small bowel. The tag-less PillCam Patency Capsule was useful to evaluate the patency of the small bowel to confirm the safer capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected small bowel strictures. However, the PPC itself may show the symptoms of ileus. The cases with abdominal surgical history could be a risk for capsule retention even though PillCam Patency Capsule confirmed the patency.""",Excluded
3009,"Posterior capsule opacification severity, assessed with straylight measurement, as main indicator of early visual function deterioration PURPOSE: To study the effect of posterior capsule opacification (PCO) morphology and severity on different aspects of visual function (VF): the small-angle domain (visual acuity [VA], contrast sensitivity [CS]) and large-angle domain (straylight; logarithm of the straylight parameter s [log{s}]). To evaluate whether straylight is a valuable additional indicator for appropriate posterior capsulotomy referral., DESIGN: Prospective, comparative study., PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: For the study population, 240 pseudophakic eyes with PCO and a capsulotomy indication were selected. For the reference population, 99 pseudophakic eyes without PCO were selected., METHODS: The relation between PCO morphology and PCO severity and the precapsulotomy and postcapsulotomy logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), logarithm of CS (log[CS]), and log(s) values were determined. The PCO severity was assessed with retroillumination using evaluation of posterior capsule opacification (EPCO) software. Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values were used to predict functionally significant logMAR and log(s) improvement after capsulotomy., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The logMAR, log(CS), and log(s) improvements of >=0.20 log units were considered functionally significant (i.e., treatment effect). Precapsulotomy logMAR and log(s) values, above which a treatment effect (improvement>=0.20 log units) can be expected with >=50% probability, were determined and called cutoff values., RESULTS: Postcapsulotomy VF improvement was related to precapsulotomy VF values: Postcapsulotomy improvement was largest in cases with substantially impaired precapsulotomy VF parameters. Visual function deterioration was related to PCO severity rather than PCO morphology. The PCO severity (EPCO score) assessed with retroillumination has a progressive, linear relation with log(s) and a curvilinear relation with logMAR. Reflected light examination is expected to overestimate functional PCO severity. The precapsulotomy cutoff value was >=1.44 for log(s) and >=0.21 for logMAR., CONCLUSIONS: The linear relation between retroillumination PCO severity and log(s) indicates that log(s) is sensitive to low PCO severity, whereas the curvilinear relation between PCO severity and logMAR indicates that logMAR is unaffected by low PCO severity. Straylight is a sensitive, additional indicator for capsulotomy referral, especially in less severe cases of PCO.

1282,"Solid cancer mortality associated with chronic external radiation exposure at the french atomic energy commission and nuclear fuel company Studies of nuclear workers make it possible to directly quantify the risks associated with ionizing radiation exposure at low doses and low dose rates. Studies of the CEA (Commissariat l'Energie Atomique) and AREVA Nuclear Cycle (AREVA NC) cohort, currently the most informative such group in France, describe the long-term risk to nuclear workers associated with external exposure. Our aim is to assess the risk of mortality from solid cancers among CEA and AREVA NC nuclear workers and its association with external radiation exposure. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and internal Poisson regressions were conducted, controlling for the main confounding factors sex, attained age, calendar period, company and socioeconomic status (SES). During the period 19682004, there were 2,035 solid cancers among the 36,769 CEA-AREVA NC workers. Cumulative external radiation exposure was assessed for the period 19502004, and the mean cumulative dose was 12.1 mSv. Mortality rates for all causes and all solid cancers were both significantly lower in this cohort than in the general population. A significant excess of deaths from pleural cancer, not associated with cumulative external dose, was observed, probably due to past asbestos exposure. We observed a significant excess of melanoma, also unassociated with dose. Although cumulative external dose was not associated with mortality from all solid cancers, the central estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv of 0.46 for solid cancer mortality was higher than the 0.26 calculated for male Hiroshima and Nagasaki A-bomb survivors 50 years or older and exposed at the age of 30 years or older. The modification of our results after stratification for SES demonstrates the importance of this characteristic in occupational studies, because it makes it possible to take class-based lifestyle differences into account, at least partly. These results show the great potential of a further joint international study of nuclear workers, which should improve knowledge about the risks associated with chronic low doses and provide useful risk estimates for radiation protection. © 2011 by Radiation Research Society.",Included
1002,"Cost of treating diabetic foot ulcers in five different countries Most estimates in the literature for the economic cost of treating a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) are from industrialized countries. There is also marked heterogeneity between the complexity of cases considered in the different studies. The goal of the present article was to estimate treatment costs and costs to patients in five different countries (Chile, China, India, Tanzania, and the United States) for two hypothetical, but well-defined, DFUs at the extreme ends of the complexity spectrum. A co-author, who is a treating physician in the relevant country, was asked to choose treatment plans that represented the typical application of local resources to the DFU. The outcomes were pre-defined as complete healing in case 1 and trans-tibial amputation in case 2, but the time course of treatment was determined by each investigator in a manner that would be typical for their clinic. The costs, in local currencies, for each course of treatment were estimated with the assistance of local hospital administrators. Typical reimbursement scenarios in each country were used to estimate the cost burden to the patient, which was then expressed as a percentage of the annual per capita purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product. There were marked differences in the treatment plans between countries based on the availability of resources and the realities of local conditions. The costs of treatment for case 1 ranged from Int$102 to Int$3959 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost for case 2 ranged from Int$3060 to Int$188645 in Tanzania and in the United States, respectively. The cost burden to the patient varied from the equivalent of 6days of average income in the United States for case 1 to 5.7years of average annual income for case 2 in India. Although these findings do not take cost-effectiveness into account, they highlight the dramatic economic burden of a DFU for patients in some countries. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
3273,"Taste dysfunction in patients receiving radiotherapy BACKGROUND: Taste loss is a major cause of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation., METHODS: In a prospective study, 51 patients undergoing radical head and neck irradiation at the Tokyo University Hospital were assessed for taste loss. Taste ability was measured by the taste threshold for the four basic tastes (sweet, sour, salt, and bitter qualities) plus another taste of ""umami"" quality using a filter-paper-disc method in patients before, during, and after radiotherapy (RT)., RESULTS: All tastes declined on the fifth week after the start of RT and improved on the 11th week. Anatomic pathologic analyses in rats revealed that taste buds diminished completely on the sixth day after irradiation of 15 Gy in a single fraction, and the appearance of taste buds returned almost to the preirradiation state on the 28th day., CONCLUSIONS: The main cause of taste disorder resulting from RT was believed to be a disappearance of taste buds and not damage to the taste nerves.",Excluded
2982,"Myelosuppression after radiation therapy in patients with and without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: A retrospective observational study Background/Aim: Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after high-dose chemotherapy is used to treat relapsed malignant lymphomas. Radiation therapy (RT) is applied after ASCT. We compared the incidence of myelosuppression after RT with and without autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT). Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 20 patients with malignant lymphomas who received RT, six of whom underwent auto-PBSCT. Univariate analysis using Pearson's Chi-squared test and multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model were performed to determine correlations between the development of grade two or more leukopenia and clinical factors. Result(s): Among patients with auto-PBSCT, grade two or more leukopenia occurred in five. The incidence of grade two or more leukopenia was significantly higher in patients with auto-PBSCT than in those without (p=0.014). Conclusion(s): Hematopoietic functions after auto-PBSCT may be more vulnerable to RT than normal hematopoietic functions.Copyright © 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

1056,"Impact of vitamin D correction on circulating irisin: A 12 month interventional study Irisin, a novel myokine secreted by skeletal muscle, promotes browning of white fat and influences glucose and energy homeostasis. Irisin and vitamin D are also known for their roles in the musculoskeletal system. In this study, we examined the impact of vitamin D correction on circulating irisin in Saudi subjects. For this, vitamin D deficient subjects (<=50 nmol/l) were advised to receive adequate sunlight, eat vitamin D enriched foods and retain normal physical activity for correction/improvement in vitamin D status. Seventy-eight (30 male and 48 female) subjects, who responded to vitamin D intervention, were selected for further analyses. Anthropometry and routine biochemical assay were performed. Serum 25 (OH) D was analyzed using electrochemiluminiscence. Irisin levels were analyzed at baseline and after 12-month of intervention. Serum 25 (OH) D levels were significantly increased at post-intervention compared to baseline value (51.0+/-4.0 vs. 27.8+/-2.3 in males and 69.1+/-4.5 vs. 27.1+/-1.8 in females). With an increase in the levels of vitamin D adjusted for age and BMI, a corresponding increase in irisin level was observed in males (P=0.026) and to a lesser extent in females (P=0.093). Thus, vitamin D correction had a significant impact on irisin levels in male Saudi subjects but in females it failed to reach at significance. Further studies are needed in other ethnic population to better understand the influence of vitamin D on irisin regulation and secretion.Copyright © 2016, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

1230,"The benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy Background: Many patients with cancer experience depression and anxiety, and an associated decrease in quality of life (QOL) during radiation therapy (RT). The main objective of the study was to determine the benefits of psychosocial interventions for cancer patients who received RT. Method(s): Patients with cancer (n = 178) who agreed to participate in the study were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 89) or the control arm (n = 89). Patients in the intervention group received psychosocial care during RT, whereas the control group received RT only. The benefits of the intervention were evaluated using the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) to measure depression, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) to survey health-related QOL. The association between intervention and survival was also assessed. Result(s): Patients randomly assigned to the intervention arm showed significant improvements on symptoms of depression (p < 0.05) and anxiety (p < 0.05), health-related QOL (p < 0.05) (i.e. better global health status, and physical and emotional functioning, and less insomnia) when compared with controls. In the subset analysis, female patients, those that received high dose irradiation, and those that underwent adjuvant chemotherapy could benefit more from psychosocial intervention. There was no difference between the two groups in disease-free survival (DFS) (2-year DFS 79.8% in the intervention arm and 76.4% in the control arm; p = 0.527) and overall survival (OS) (2-year OS 83.1% in the intervention arm and 84.3% in the control arm; p = 0.925). Conclusion(s): Psychosocial intervention is a cost-effective approach that can improve a patient's mood and QOL both during and after RT. However, the intervention was not found to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence and death. © 2013 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

402,"Underprediction of visibly complex chromosome aberrations by a recombinational-repair ('one-hit') model Purpose: Published low-LET FISH data were used to test two models of chromosome aberration production based on breakage-and-reunion or recombinational repair. Material(s) and Method(s): Randomness of DNA double strand break induction and misrejoining is analyzed comprehensively and adopted as a working hypothesis. Proximity effects are approximated by using interaction sites. Model results are calculated using CAS (chromosome aberration simulator) Monte Carlo computer software with two adjustable parameters. CAS can emulate the specifics of any experimental painting protocol, allowing very detailed tests of the models. Result(s): To reasonable approximation, breakage-and-reunion model predictions are consistent with low-LET FISH results, including two large, elaborate, one-paint data sets. An explicitly specified version of the recombinational-repair model severely underpredicts the frequency of the visibly complex aberration patterns most commonly observed with one-paint FISH, and is inconsistent with some observed multi-paint patterns. When high-dose effects (distortion and saturation) are taken into account quantitatively, a dose-response relation for apparently simple interchanges slightly favours the breakage-and-reunion model over the recombinational-repair model, despite being approximately linear over the dose range 2-6 Gy. Conclusion(s): The random breakage-and-reunion model gives comprehensive baseline predictions that are sufficiently accurate for the organization of experimental results. The data speak against complex aberrations being formed by the random recombinational repair pathway discussed here.",Excluded
127,"Cerebrovascular diseases in nuclear workers first employed at the Mayak PA in 1948-1972 Incidence and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) (430-438 ICD-9 codes) have been studied in a cohort of 18,763 workers first employed at the Mayak Production Association (Mayak PA) in 1948-1972 and followed up to the end of 2005. Some of the workers were exposed to external gamma-rays only while others were exposed to a mixture of external gamma-rays and internal alpha-particle radiation due to incorporated (239)Pu. After adjusting for non-radiation factors, there were significantly increasing trends in CVD incidence with total absorbed dose from external gamma-rays and total absorbed dose to liver from internal alpha radiation. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed external gamma-ray doses greater than 0.20 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses; the data were consistent with a linear trend in risk with external dose. The CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with total absorbed internal alpha-radiation doses to liver from incorporated (239)Pu greater than 0.025 Gy compared to those exposed to lower doses. There was no statistically significant trend in CVD mortality risk with either external gamma-ray dose or internal alpha-radiation dose to liver. The risk estimates obtained are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors. Further studies of the unique cohort of Mayak workers chronically exposed to external and internal radiation will allow improving the reliability and validating the radiation safety standards for occupational and public exposure.",Included
3306,"Sexual Function, Quality of Life, and Mood After Radiation Therapy in Patients with Anal Cancer PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE(S): Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) results in high cure rates of anal cancer, with advanced radiation (RT) techniques improving toxicity. However, there is limited data regarding these patients' sexual function (SF), quality of life (QOL), and mood. We hypothesized that anal cancer treatment would result in detrimental effects on SF, QOL, and mood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients with anal cancer treated with definitive CRT. We assessed SF for women with the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and for men with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). For all patients, we assessed QOL using EORTC QLQ-C30 and CR29 and mood using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). We reported descriptive statistics for SF, QOL, and mood and used univariate analysis to evaluate predictors of SF for women., RESULTS: Of 50 eligible patients, 84% completed the surveys. Median time from RT until survey was 36 months (1-97 months). Women (n = 34) reported poor SF overall (mean FSFI score = 15, scale 2-36, standard deviation (SD) 10.4). Most women reported poor SF related to satisfaction, desire, orgasm, arousal, pain, and lubrication. Men (n = 8) also had poor overall satisfaction (mean IIEF score = 6.1, scale 2-10, SD 3.6). Men reported poor erectile function and lower satisfaction with intercourse. Mean QLQ-C30 QOL score was 86.5 (SD 16.3). Results from EORTC QLQ-CR-20 demonstrated patients experienced poor sexual interest. Per HADS, 2.5% reported depression and 18% anxiety., CONCLUSION: Patients with anal cancer experience sexual dysfunction after RT, with QOL and mood symptoms similar to patients with other cancers. Our data support the need for ongoing efforts to understand and address issues with SF, QOL, and mood following RT for these patients.",Excluded
351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded

2040,"Reinforcing the Importance and Feasibility of Implementing a Low-dose Protocol for CT-guided Biopsies RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: This study sought to more definitely illustrate the impact and feasibility of implementing a low-dose protocol for computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies using size-specific dose estimates and multivariate analyses., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty consecutive CT-guided lung and extrapulmonary biopsies were reviewed before and after implementation of a low-dose protocol (200 patients total, mean age 61 +/- 15 years, 128 women). Analyses of variance with Bonferroni correction were used to compare standard and low-dose protocols in terms of patient demographics, physician experience, target lesion size, total dose-length product, total acquisitions, size-specific dose estimate, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion conspicuity ratings. All procedures were performed on the same 16-slice CT scanner., RESULTS: Voluntary protocol adherence was 100% (lung) and 89% (extrapulmonary). The low-dose protocol achieved significantly lower total average dose-length product [(lung) 735.6 +/- 599.4 mGy x cm to 252.1 +/- 101.9 mGy x cm, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 724.7 +/- 545.0 mGy x cm to 392.9 +/- 239.5 mGy x cm, P < .001] and size-specific dose estimate [(lung) 5.2 +/- 0.8 mGy x cm to 4.3 +/- 1.5 mGy, P < .001; (extrapulmonary) 10.1 +/- 6.7 mGy to 6.5 +/- 2.7 mGy, P < .001]. Only the change in protocol was independently associated with lower size-specific dose estimates when controlling for the other variables (P < .0001). This was achieved with no significant differences in signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, or lesion conspicuity., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a low-dose protocol for CT-guided biopsies resulted in 21% and 36% of size-specific dose estimate reduction for lung and extrapulmonary biopsies, respectively, with excellent adherence.

2772,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for melanoma and renal cell carcinoma: Impact of single fraction equivalent dose on local control Background: Melanoma and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are traditionally considered less radioresponsive than other histologies. Whereas stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) involves radiation dose intensification via escalation, we hypothesize SBRT might result in similar high local control rates as previously published on metastases of varying histologies. Method(s): The records of patients with metastatic melanoma (n = 17 patients, 28 lesions) or RCC (n = 13 patients, 25 lesions) treated with SBRT were reviewed. Local control (LC) was defined pathologically by negative biopsy or radiographically by lack of tumor enlargement on CT or stable/declining standardized uptake value (SUV) on PET scan. The SBRT dose regimen was converted to the single fraction equivalent dose (SFED) to characterize the dose-control relationship using a logistic tumor control probability (TCP) model. Additionally, the kinetics of decline in maximum SUV (SUVmax) were analyzed. Result(s): The SBRT regimen was 40-50 Gy/5 fractions (n = 23) or 42-60 Gy/3 fractions (n = 30) delivered to lung (n = 39), liver (n = 11) and bone (n = 3) metastases. Median follow-up for patients alive at the time of analysis was 28.0 months (range, 4-68). The actuarial LC was 88% at 18 months. On univariate analysis, higher dose per fraction (p < 0.01) and higher SFED (p = 0.06) were correlated with better LC, as was the biologic effective dose (BED, p < 0.05). The actuarial rate of LC at 24 months was 100% for SFED >=45 Gy v 54% for SFED <45 Gy. TCP modeling indicated that to achieve >=90% 2 yr LC in a 3 fraction regimen, a prescription dose of at least 48 Gy is required. In 9 patients followed with PET scans, the mean pre-SBRT SUVmax was 7.9 and declined with an estimated half-life of 3.8 months to a post-treatment plateau of approximately 3. Conclusion(s): An aggressive SBRT regimen with SFED >= 45 Gy is effective for controlling metastatic melanoma and RCC. The SFED metric appeared to be as robust as the BED in characterizing dose-response, though additional studies are needed. The LC rates achieved are comparable to those obtained with SBRT for other histologies, suggesting a dominant mechanism of in vivo tumor ablation that overrides intrinsic differences in cellular radiosensitivity between histologic subtypes. © 2011 Stinauer et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

During radiotherapy the salivary glands were located in the core irradiation field. Primary efficacy parameters were sialometry, quantitative salivary gland scintigraphy and clinical evaluation of early effects of radiotherapy (RTOG-score, Table 1). All data were collected at 6 assessments: 1 week pre-radiation (U1), at start (U2), half time (U3) and end (U4) of irradiation, 8 days (U5) and 28 days (U6) after the end of irradiation (Figure 1)., RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11 verum, 12 placebo) completed the study with all assessments. Sialometrically, all patients were severely (half of radiotherapy) or completely (end of radiotherapy) xerostomatic (Figure 2). In a global efficacy measure according to O'Brien combining scintigraphy and RTOG there was a tendency for a higher efficacy of verum compared to placebo (p = 0.068). After start of irradiation therapy, the RTOG-score showed continuously and significantly lower early radiation effects under verum than under placebo (U3 vs U6: p < 0.05, area under curve: p = 0.032; Table 2, Figure 3). The scintigraphically determined excretion fraction was slightly less impaired in the verum group compared to the placebo treatment (p = 0.12. Figure 4). There was no difference in drug safety between placebo and verum for adverse events, changes in the activity of liver enzymes and for global impression of tolerability., CONCLUSIONS: The results give support for an advantageous effect of Venalot Depot in the treatment of radiogenic sialadenitis and mucositis. In even a small number of evaluable patients, early clinical effects of irradiation (RTOG-score) were less pronounced in the active treatment group than in the placebo group, but the sample size was too low to prove statistically also the benefit of coumarin/troxerutine with the scintigraphic method.

Patients and Methods: In 2005 and 2006, 55 patients (43 men, 12 women; median age 60 years) with locally advanced oesophageal cancer (cT3-4 Nx M0; 24 with squamous cell carcinoma, 31 with adenocarcinoma) underwent transthoracic en bloc oesophagectomy after completion of treatment with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and radiotherapy ad 36 Gy in a prospective clinical trial. Of the 55 patients, 21 (38%) were classified as histopathological responders (<10% vital residual tumour cells) and 34 (62%) as nonresponders. FDG-PET was performed before (PET 1) and 3-4 weeks after the end (PET 2) of radiochemotherapy with assessment of maximum and average standardized uptake values (SUV) for correlation with histopathological response and survival. Result(s): Histopathological responders had a slightly higher baseline SUV than nonresponders (p<0.0001 between PET 1 and PET 2 for responders and nonresponders) and the decrease was more prominent in responders. Except for SUVmax in patients with squamous cell carcinoma neither baseline nor preoperative SUV nor percent SUV reduction correlated significantly with histopathological response. Histopathological responders had a 2-year overall survival of 91+/-9% and nonresponders a survival of 53+/-10% (p=0.007).

441,"Nomogram for predicting symptom severity during radiation therapy for head and neck cancer OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy (RT), with or without chemotherapy, can cause significant acute toxicity among patients treated for head and neck cancer (HNC), but predicting, before treatment, who will experience a particular toxicity or symptom is difficult. We created and evaluated 2 multivariate models and generated a nomogram to predict symptom severity during RT based on a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck Module (MDASI-HN)., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, longitudinal, questionnaire-based study., SETTING: Tertiary cancer care center., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were 264 patients with HNC (mostly oropharyngeal) who had completed the MDASI-HN before and during therapy. Pretreatment variables were correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during therapy with multivariate modeling and then were correlated with the composite MDASI-HN score during week 5 of therapy., RESULTS: A multivariate model incorporating pretreatment PROs better predicted MDASI-HN symptom scores during treatment than did a model based on clinical variables and physician-rated patient performance status alone (Akaike information criterion = 1442.5 vs 1459.9). In the most parsimonious model, pretreatment MDASI-HN symptom severity (P < .001), concurrent chemotherapy (P = .006), primary tumor site (P = .016), and receipt of definitive (rather than adjuvant) RT (P = .044) correlated with MDASI-HN symptom scores during week 5. That model was used to construct a nomogram., CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrates the value of incorporating baseline PROs, in addition to disease and treatment characteristics, to predict patient symptom burden during therapy. Although additional investigation and validation are required, PRO-inclusive prediction tools can be useful for improving symptom interventions and expectations for patients being treated for HNC.

762,"Measurement of lung airways in three dimensions using hyperpolarized helium-3 MRI Large airway measurement is clinically important in cases of airway disease and trauma. The gold standard is computed tomography (CT), which allows for airway measurement. However, the ionizing radiation dose associated with CT is a major limitation in longitudinal studies and trauma. To avoid ionizing radiation from CT, we present a method for measuring the large airway diameter in humans using hyperpolarized helium-3 (HPHe) MRI in conjunction with a dynamic 3D radial acquisition. An algorithm is introduced which utilizes the significant airway contrast for semi-automated segmentation and skeletonization which is used to derive the airway lumen diameter. The HPHe MRI method was validated with quantitative CT in an excised and desiccated porcine lung (linear regression R(2) = 0.974 and slope = 0.966 over 32 airway segments). The airway lumen diameters were then compared in 24 human subjects (22 asthmatics and 2 normals; linear regression R(2) value of 0.799 and slope = 0.768 over 309 airway segments).

2046,"Individual consistency in exploratory behaviour and mating tactics in male guppies While behavioural plasticity is considered an adaptation to fluctuating social and environmental conditions, many animals also display a high level of individual consistency in their behaviour over time or across contexts (generally termed 'personality'). However, studies of animal personalities that include sexual behaviour, or functionally distinct but correlated traits, are relatively scarce. In this study, we tested for individual behavioural consistency in courtship and exploratory behaviour in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in two light environments (high vs. low light intensity). Based on previous work on guppies, we predicted that males would modify their behaviour from sneak mating tactics to courtship displays under low light conditions, but also that the rank orders of courtship effort would remain unchanged (i.e. highly sexually active individuals would display relatively high levels of courtship under both light regimes). We also tested for correlations between courtship and exploratory behaviour, predicting that males that had high display rates would also be more likely to approach a novel object. Although males showed significant consistency in their exploratory and mating behaviour over time (1 week), we found no evidence that these traits constituted a behavioural syndrome. Furthermore, in contrast to previous work, we found no overall effect of the light environment on any of the behaviours measured, although males responded to the treatment on an individual-level basis, as reflected by a significant individual-by-environment interaction. The future challenge is to investigate how individual consistency across different environmental contexts relates to male reproductive success. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

There is an inverse relationship between fluoroscopy time and endoscopist experience. Objective(s): To determine the relationship between the technical difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla, and time to perform the procedure and fluoroscopy time. Method(s): Patients scheduled for ERCP were divided in two groups depending on the degree of difficulty of the process according to Schutz classification: group A (grades 1-3) and group B (grades 4 and 5). We registered demographic variables, reference diagnosis, endoscopic and radiological diagnoses, degree of difficulty to cannulate Vater's papilla (Freeman scale), duration of procedure, fluoroscopy time and endoscopic complications. Result(s): 213 patients were included: 101 in group A and 112 in group B. Mean fluoroscopy time was 59.15 seconds in group A and 93.59 seconds in group B (p <0.0001). Mean time to perform the procedure was 13.18 minutes in group A and 20.23 minutes in group B (p <0.0001). Factors related to increased fluoroscopy time were technical difficulty for the CPE according to Schutz (p <0.0001), stent placement (p = 0.021) and hydrostatic dilation (p <0.0001).

The objective of our study was to analyze the effectiveness of prestudy questionnaires in identifying at-risk patients and estimate the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis risk factors, and other comorbidities in patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity MR angiography (MRA) studies using gadoliniumbased contrast agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Patent demographics, comorbidities, contrast type, and point-of-care (POC) serum creatinine values were recorded from the medical records of consecutive patients undergoing lower extremity MRA examinations in a single year. Patients were divided into groups by CKD stage (non-CKD, stage III, stage IV, or stage V) on the basis of estimated glomerular filtration rate values determined from POC creatinine results. Patient awareness of a history of CKD was noted if patients admitted to any form of CKD on prestudy questionnaires. RESULTS. Of 199 patients, 72 patients (36.2%) had stage III CKD, six patients (3.0%) had stage IV CKD, and seven patients (3.5%) had stage V CKD. Comorbidities - including smoking status, transplant status, and presence of diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease - as well as administered contrast type and dosage showed significant differences among the CKD groups (p < 0.05). Only five stage III patients (7%) were aware of any history of renal dysfunction, whereas three stage IV patients (50%) and seven stage V patients (100%) admitted any history of renal dysfunction via questionnaires. CONCLUSION. Compared with POC creatinine testing, a prestudy questionnaire used alone is ineffective in identifying all patients with histories of CKD who are scheduled to undergo gadolinium-based peripheral MRA studies. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
1334,"Long-Term Cognitive Functioning in Single-Dose Total-Body Gamma-Irradiated Rhesus Monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ) In this study, the effects of a potentially lethal radiation exposure on the brain for long-term cognitive sequelae were investigated using Rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) adopted from other facilities after analysis of acute radiation response via the Centers for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR) network. Fifty-nine animals were given the opportunity to participate in cognitive cage-side testing. The animals that received single-dose gamma irradiation were significantly less likely to engage in cognitive testing than the controls, suggesting that irradiated animals may have differences in cognitive ability. Five irradiated (6.75-8.05 Gy) and three naive control animals self-selected, were extensively trained and administered a simple visual discrimination with reversal (SVD+R) task 2-3 times per week for 11-18 months. Each session consisted of 30 trials in which the animals were required to choose the correct visual stimulus for a food reward. After the initial presentation, the stimulus that signaled the presence of food was twice reversed once the animal reached criterion (90% accuracy across four consecutive sessions). While the limited sample size precluded definitive statistical analysis, irradiated animals took longer to reach the criterion subsequent to reversal than did control animals, suggesting a relative deficiency in cognitive flexibility. These results provide preliminary data supporting the potential use of a nonhuman primate model to study radiation-induced, late-delayed cognitive deficits.",Included
3366,"Knee medial and lateral contact forces in a musculoskeletal model with subject-specific contact point trajectories Contact point (CP) trajectory is a crucial parameter in estimating medial/lateral tibio-femoral contact forces from the musculoskeletal (MSK) models. The objective of the present study was to develop a method to incorporate the subject-specific CP trajectories into the MSK model. Ten healthy subjects performed 45 s treadmill gait trials. The subject-specific CP trajectories were constructed on the tibia and femur as a function of extension-flexion using low-dose bi-plane X-ray images during a quasi-static squat. At each extension-flexion position, the tibia and femur CPs were superimposed in the three directions on the medial side, and in the anterior-posterior and proximal-distal directions on the lateral side to form the five kinematic constraints of the knee joint. The Lagrange multipliers associated to these constraints directly yielded the medial/lateral contact forces. The results from the personalized CP trajectory model were compared against the linear CP trajectory and sphere-on-plane CP trajectory models which were adapted from the commonly used MSK models. Changing the CP trajectory had a remarkable impact on the knee kinematics and changed the medial and lateral contact forces by 1.03 BW and 0.65 BW respectively, in certain subjects. The direction and magnitude of the medial/lateral contact force were highly variable among the subjects and the medial-lateral shift of the CPs alone could not determine the increase/decrease pattern of the contact forces. The suggested kinematic constraints are adaptable to the CP trajectories derived from a variety of joint models and those experimentally measured from the 3D imaging techniques.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
462,"Subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and early vascular aging from long-term low-dose ionizing radiation exposure: a genetic, telomere, and vascular ultrasound study in cardiac catheterization laboratory staff OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the association between long-term radiation exposure in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab) and early signs of subclinical atherosclerosis. BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence of an excess risk of cardiovascular disease at low-dose levels of ionizing radiation exposure. METHODS: Left and right carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) was measured in 223 cath lab personnel (141 male; age, 45 +/- 8 years) and 222 unexposed subjects (113 male; age, 44+/-10 years). Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA repair gene XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism was also analyzed to explore the possible interaction with radiation exposure. The occupational radiological risk score (ORRS) was computed for each subject on the basis of the length of employment, individual caseload, and proximity to the radiation source. A complete lifetime effective dose (mSv) was recorded for 57 workers. RESULTS: Left, right, and averaged CIMTs were significantly increased in high-exposure workers compared with both control subjects and low-exposure workers (all p values<0.04). On the left side, but not on the right, there was a significant correlation between CIMT and ORRS (p=0.001) as well as lifetime dose (p=0.006). LTL was significantly reduced in exposed workers compared with control subjects (p=0.008). There was a significant correlation between LTL and both ORRS (p=0.002) and lifetime dose (p=0.03). The XRCC3 Met241 allele presented a significant interaction with high exposure for right side (pinteraction=0.002), left side (pinteraction<0.0001), and averaged (pinteraction<0.0001) CIMTs. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term radiation exposure in a cath lab may be associated with increased subclinical CIMT and telomere length shortening, suggesting evidence of accelerated vascular aging and early atherosclerosis.",Included
2679,"A novel strategy of radiofrequency hyperthermia (neothermia) in combination with preoperative chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advanced rectal cancer: A pilot study The safety of weekly regional hyperthermia performed with 8 MHz radiofrequency (RF) capacitive heating equipment has been established in rectal cancer. We aimed to standardize hyperthermia treatment for scientific evaluation and for assessing local tumor response to RF hyperthermia in rectal cancer. Forty-nine patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma were included in the study. All patients received chemoradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 days/week (dose, 50 Gy/25 times) concomitant with 5 days/week for five times of capecitabine (1700 mg/m2 per day) and once a week for five times of 50 min irradiations by an 8 MHz RF capacitive heating device. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery 8 weeks after treatment. Three patients did not undergo surgery because of progressive disease (PD) and 13 refused. Eight (16.3%) patients had a pathological complete response (ypCR) after surgery. Among patients without surgery, 3 (6.1%) had clinical complete response (CR) and 3 (6.1%) had local CR but distant PD (CRPD). Ninety percent of ypCR + CR patients were shown in 6.21 W min-1 m-2/treatment or higher group of average total accumulated irradiation output with 429degreeC min-1 m-2 or higher group of total accumulated thermal output. However, a patient with CRPD was in the higher total accumulated thermal output group. We propose a new quantitative parameter for the hyperthermia and demonstrated that patients can benefit from mild irradiation with mild temperature. Using these parameters, the exact output, optimal thermal treatment, and contraindications or indications of this modality could be determined in a multi-institutional, future study.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.",Excluded
1386,"Limb salvage in proximal humerus malignant tumors: The place of free vascularized fibular graft Limb-salvage surgery has become a safe and well-established alternative to amputations for malignant tumors of the proximal humerus. The authors describe six cases with favorable restoration of the upper limb following tumor resection type IB Malawer and proximal humeral reconstruction by vascularized fibula graft (VFG) as a primary or secondary procedure. A scapulofibular arthrodesis was elected in all cases. A special custom-made plate was used in four cases. One patient required a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for better coverage. Serial x-rays assessed the bone union. Neither flap necrosis nor sepsis phenomena were noted. Stress fracture was the only complication. This was encountered in two cases. Every patient was reviewed and assessed by the Enneking score. The average score was 21.8. The average follow-up was 5-years.

3378,"Direction-changeable cage reduces x-ray exposure in treating isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis: A retrospective study In spite of a variety of designs for the lumbar interbody fusion cage, there is no consensus on the optimal design so far. Different cage designs may cause different extent of X-ray exposure to visualize the cage positon intraoperatively. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated the X-ray exposure and clinical outcomes of the direction-changeable cage in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF). The patients were divided into the direction-changeable cage group (group A, n=79) and non-direction-changeable cage group (group B, n=84). Intraoperative implantation duration, cage position adjustment times, implantation fluoroscopy times, fluoroscopy exposure time of cage implantation, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were recorded before and after operation at the last follow-up. CT scanning was performed to evaluate lumbar fusion. All the patients underwent single-level TLIF and were followed up for 12 to 18 months. In the group A, intraoperative implantation duration, cage position adjustment times, implantation fluoroscopy times, and fluoroscopy exposure time of cage implantation were 6.7 +/- 3.6 min, 1.2 +/- 0.4 times, 2.5 +/- 0.6 times, 7.84 +/- 1.83 s, retrospectively. In the group B, these parameters were 11.5 +/- 5.9 min, 2.6 +/- 1.3 times, 5.8 +/- 1.7 times, and 15.31 +/- 5.16 s retrospectively, which were higher than those in the non-direction-changeable cage group with statistical significance (P<0.05). In terms of ODI and VAS scores, there was no statistical difference between the two groups before or after operation at the last follow-up (P>0.05). Regarding to the complications, there were 4 cases (4.49%) in the group A, with 3 cases of non-union and 1 case of dural laceration. Eight cases (10.53%) showed complications in the group B, with 7 cases of non-union and 1 case of infection. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of the complication rate (P<0.05). In conclusion, the direction-changeable cage has merits like lower radiation exposure and fewer complications compared to the non-direction-changeable cage in treating isthmic lumbar spondylolisthesis. Both cages could yield equal clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3414,"Iodine-125 brachytherapy alone for advanced primary parotid gland carcinoma This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of iodine-125 (125I) brachytherapy alone for the treatment of advanced parotid gland carcinoma and to identify predictors of tumour control and patient survival. Primary parotid gland carcinoma patients (n = 23) treated with 125I brachytherapy alone between 1 October 2005 and 31 July 2013 at Peking University Stomatology Hospital were enrolled in this retrospective study. All had clinical stage IV disease. The prescribed dose was 60-160 Gy. The local control rate, survival rate, and predictors of the prognosis were evaluated. Adverse events related to treatment were also noted. The average follow-up time was 29 months (range 9-74 months). Among the 23 patients, six had local failure and 11 died during the follow-up period. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates were 87.0%, 55.4%, and 47.5%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 73.9%, 47.0%, and 39.2%, respectively. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year local control rates were 82.1%, 73.9%, and 73.9%, respectively. Age and distant metastasis were independent predictors of survival, while the preoperative duration of the disease was an independent predictor of local control. The use of 125I seed brachytherapy alone for the treatment of primary parotid gland carcinoma can provide good short-term results without causing any severe side effects.Copyright © 2017",Excluded
1938,"[Simultaneous radiochemotherapy and endoluminal HDR brachytherapy in esophageal cancer] PURPOSE: To study efficacy and toxicity of radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer including initial endoluminal high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 01/1995 and 06/2005, 61 patients with esophageal cancer were treated preoperatively with definitive and palliative intent. Treatment started with intraluminal HDR-BT for recanalization of the esophagus (single fraction size of 8 Gy in 0.5 cm depth, three times, q7d) followed by external-beam radiation therapy (50 Gy total dose, 5 x 2 Gy/week, 25 fractions in 5 weeks). Chemotherapy was started simultaneously with external irradiation (three courses of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, q21d)., RESULTS: Swallowing function improved in 55/61 patients (dysphagia classification according to the RTOG), and worsened in 6/61 patients, respectively. Median duration of symptomatic improvement was 11 months, median follow-up 12 months (range 3-68 months). Following simultaneous radiochemotherapy, tumor resectability was achieved in 7/25 patients of the neoadjuvant group, and the histological specimen showed complete remission in 6/7 patients., CONCLUSION: These results indicate a favorable effect of simultaneous radiochemotherapy starting with endoluminal HDR-afterloading-( AL-)BT in esophageal cancer.",Excluded
1488,"Pedicled perforator flap of stellate design The perforator flap has proven to be effective as both a free flap and a pedicled flap in the reconstruction of a variety of regions. Usually, a V-Y advancement pattern or simple ellipse is the design selected for pedicled perforator island flaps. On the other hand, the transposition of multiple perforator flaps or skin grafting on the donor sites is required for larger defects. The authors used a stellate design to elevate a perforator flap with large dimensions, whilst allowing the easier closure of the donor defect. This method was used for reconstructing the sacral (six cases), trochanteric (one case), and lower leg (three cases) regions. Although minor wound dehiscence at the donor sites was encountered in three cases, all the defects were reconstructed successfully using a single perforator flap. This design would be a valuable option for planning a pedicled perforator flap, particularly when a difficult donor closure is expected.",Excluded
1359,"Clinical results of proton-beam therapy for locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of proton-beam therapy for locoregionally advanced esophageal cancer., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The subjects were 51 patients with esophageal cancer who were treated between 1985 and 2005 using proton beams with or without X-rays. All but one had squamous cell carcinoma. Of the 51 patients, 33 received combinations of X-rays (median 46 Gy) and protons (median 36 GyE) as a boost. The median total dose of combined X-rays and proton radiation for these 33 patients was 80 GyE (range 70-90 GyE). The other 18 patients received proton-beam therapy alone (median 79 GyE, range 62-98 GyE)., RESULTS: Treatment interruption due to radiation-induced esophagitis or hematologic toxicity was not required for any patient. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 51 patients was 21.1% and the median survival time was 20.5 months (95% confidence interval 10.9-30.2). Of the 51 patients, 40 (78%) showed a complete response within 4 months after completing treatment and seven (14%) showed a partial response, giving a response rate of 92% (47/51). The 5-year local control rate for all 51 patients was 38.0% and the median local control time was 25.5 months (95% confidence interval 14.6-36.3)., CONCLUSION: The results suggest that proton-beam therapy is an effective treatment for patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. Further studies are required to determine the optimal total dose, fractionation schedules, and best combination of proton therapy with chemotherapy.",Excluded

For assessment, wound measurement was done before, during and after treatment and wound healing time as well as lab tests like swab culture, X-ray of affected part, Hemoglobin, Total Leucocytes Count, Differential Leucocytes Count, Liver Function Test, blood sugar level and HbA1c were recorded. Patients with tubercular, malignant ulcers and with ulcers of less than 6 weeks duration were excluded from the study. In the patients treated with only Nimba taila, 31.2% (5/16) patients had 50% healing at eight weeks therapy while with only Manjistha churna, 20.0% (3/15) patients had 50% healing at eight weeks therapy but in the cases, treated with both the drugs, 75.0% (15/20) patients had achieved 50% healing at eight weeks therapy. The study suggests that there is an added effect (quick healing of wound) of Nimba taila with Manjistha churna & its kwatha in cases of non healing diabetic ulcer and single use of Nimba taila or Manjistha churna is not much significant but it is observed keenly that use of Nimba taila alone is comparatively more beneficial than single use of Manjistha churna.

258,"Stimulus intensity affects early sensory processing: visual contrast modulates evoked gamma-band activity in human EEG We studied the effect of different contrast levels on the visual evoked gamma-band response (GBR) in order to investigate whether the GBR is modulated in a similar manner as previously reported for visual evoked potentials. Previous studies showed that the GBR can be modulated by individual characteristics (age) and experimental conditions (task difficulty, attention). However, stimulus properties, such as size and spatial frequency, also have a large impact on the GBR, which necessitates identification and control of relevant stimulus properties for optimal experimental setups. Twenty-one healthy participants were investigated during a forced-choice discrimination task. Sinusoidal gratings were presented at three contrast levels with a constant spatial frequency of 5 cycles per degree visual arc (cpd). The present data replicate the results reported for visual evoked potentials and exhibit a contrast dependent modulation of the GBR. Gamma activity is increased for higher contrast levels. These results demonstrate the importance of stimulus contrast for evoked gamma activity. Thus, it appears meaningful to control the contrast of stimuli in experiments investigating the role of gamma activity in perception and information processing.",Excluded
1794,"Early body weight loss during concurrent chemo-radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer Background and purpose: Radiation-esophagitis and weight loss are frequently observed toxicities in patients treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CT-RT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and might be related. The purpose was to investigate whether weight loss already starts early after initiation of CT-RT and precedes radiation-esophagitis. Material(s) and Method(s): In a retrospective cohort, weight and esophagitis grade >=2 were assessed during the first weeks of (CT-)RT in patients treated with concurrent (n = 102) or sequential (n = 92) therapy. In a prospective validation study, data on body weight, esophagitis grade >=2, nutritional intake and muscle strength were obtained before, during and following CT-RT. Result(s): In the retrospective cohort, early weight loss was observed in concurrently treated patients (p = 0.002), independent of esophagitis >= grade 2. Early weight loss was also observed in the prospective cohort (p = 0.003) and was not accompanied by decreases in nutritional intake. In addition lower limb muscle strength rapidly declined (p = 0.042). In the later weeks of treatment, further body weight loss occurred (p < 0.001) despite increased nutritional supplementation and body weight was only partly recovered after 4 weeks post CT-RT (p = 0.003). Conclusion(s): Weight loss during concurrent CT-RT for NSCLC starts early and prior to onset of esophagitis, requiring timely and intense nutritional rehabilitation. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded

Materials and methods Three hundred high-risk patients underwent HD-CTCA and ICA. Independent experts evaluated the images for the presence of significant CAD, defined primarily as the presence of moderate (>=50%) stenosis and secondarily as the presence of severe (>=70%) stenosis in at least one coronary segment, in a blinded fashion. HD-CTCA was compared to ICA as the reference standard. Results No patients were excluded. Two hundred and six patients (69%) had moderate and 178 (59%) had severe stenosis in at least one vessel at ICA.

Preformulation studies including screening of excipients for solubility and pseudoternary phase diagrams suggested the suitability of Capmul MCM as lipid, Labrasol as surfactant, and Tween 20 as cosurfactant for preparation of self-emulsifying formulations. Preliminary composition of the SNEDDS formulations were selected from the phase diagrams and subjected to thermodynamic stability studies and dispersibility tests. The prepared liquid SNEDDS formulations were characterized for viscosity, refractive index, droplet size and zeta potential. The TEM study confirmed the formation of nanoemulsion following dilution of liquid SNEDDS. The optimized liquid SNEDDS were transformed into free flowing granules by adsorption on the porous carriers like Sylysia (350, 550, and 730) and Neusilin TM US2. Solid state characterization employing the FTIR, DSC and powder XRD studies indicated lack of any significant interaction of drug with the lipidic and emulsifying excipients, and porous carriers. In vitro drug release studies indicated faster solubilization of the drug by optimized SSNEGs (over 80% within 30 min) vis-a-vis the pure drug (only 35% within 30 min). In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in Wistar rats observed significant increase in C(max) (3.01-fold) and AUC (5.34-fold) using SSNEGs compared to pure drug, whereas no significant difference (p>0.1) was observed with the liquid SNEDDS. Thus, the present studies ratify the bioavailability enhancement potential of SSNEGs of ONH prepared using porous carriers. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3180,"Heterogeneity in the clastogenic response to X-rays in lymphocytes from ataxia-telangiectasia heterozygotes and controls A coded analysis of X-ray-induced chromatid aberrations in lymphocyte cultures from 45 control individuals and 19 ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) heterozygotes was performed. The distribution of chromatid breaks induced in the late G2 portion of the cell cycle by 60 cGy of X-rays appeared bimodal in the study population. In six controls (13 percent) and in 12 of 19 (63 percent) A-T heterozygotes, the yields of X-ray-induced breaks observed were within the higher mode of the distribution. However, lymphocytes from A-T heterozygotes sensitive to the induction of chromatid breaks by 60 cGy did not contain increased numbers of aberrations following exposure to 20 cGy. The radio-resistant inhibition of DNA synthesis that occurs in A-T homozygotes was not observed in heterozygotes. Co-cultivation experiments showed an increased G2 delay in lymphocytes from an A-T heterozygote whose lymphocytes contained increased X-ray-induced chromatid breaks. The results show a significant association of A-T heterozygosity with G2 chromosomal sensitivity (P less than 0.001; Wilcoxon rank sum test). The measurement of X-ray-induced breaks, however, failed to identify 37 percent of A-T heterozygotes tested. The predicted prevalence of increased sensitivity to X-rays in controls is approximately three- to 30-fold greater than the estimated frequency of A-T heterozygotes in the general population. Therefore, although the increased sensitivity to X-ray-induced chromatid breaks appears to be associated with the A-T-gene, it is not a reliable indicator of A-T heterozygosity. Genetic or environmental factors other than the A-T gene also must be involved in the increased clastogenic response.",Included
534,"Post-remission treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients aged 60 years and older with acute myeloid leukaemia: A time-dependent analysis Background: Acute myeloid leukaemia mainly affects elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of around 70 years. Although about 50-60% of patients enter first complete remission upon intensive induction chemotherapy, relapse remains high and overall outcomes are disappointing. Therefore, effective post-remission therapy is urgently needed. Although often no post-remission therapy is given to elderly patients, it might include chemotherapy or allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) following reduced-intensity conditioning. We aimed to assess the comparative value of allogeneic HSCT with other approaches, including no post-remission therapy, in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years and older. Method(s): For this time-dependent analysis, we used the results from four successive prospective HOVON-SAKK acute myeloid leukaemia trials. Between May 3, 2001, and Feb 5, 2010, a total of 1155 patients aged 60 years and older were entered into these trials, of whom 640 obtained a first complete remission after induction chemotherapy and were included in the analysis. Post-remission therapy consisted of allogeneic HSCT following reduced-intensity conditioning (n=97), gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n=110), chemotherapy (n=44), autologous HSCT (n=23), or no further treatment (n=366). Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine combined with 2 Gy of total body irradiation (n=71), fludarabine with busulfan (n=10), or other regimens (n=16). A time-dependent analysis was done, in which allogeneic HSCT was compared with other types of post-remission therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was 5-year overall survival for all treatment groups, analysed by a time-dependent analysis. Finding(s): 5-year overall survival was 35% (95% CI 25-44) for patients who received an allogeneic HSCT, 21% (17-26) for those who received no additional post-remission therapy, and 26% (19-33) for patients who received either additional chemotherapy or autologous HSCT. Overall survival at 5 years was strongly affected by the European LeukemiaNET acute myeloid leukaemia risk score, with patients in the favourable risk group (n=65) having better 5-year overall survival (56% [95% CI 43-67]) than those with intermediate-risk (n=131; 23% [19-27]) or adverse-risk (n=444; 13% [8-20]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Multivariable analysis with allogeneic HSCT as a time-dependent variable showed that allogeneic HSCT was associated with better 5-year overall survival (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.53-0.95], p=0.017) compared with non-allogeneic HSCT post-remission therapies or no post-remission therapy, especially in patients with intermediate-risk (0.82 [0.58-1.15]) or adverse-risk (0.39 [0.21-0.73]) acute myeloid leukaemia. Interpretation(s): Collectively, the results from these four trials suggest that allogeneic HSCT might be the preferred treatment approach in patients 60 years of age and older with intermediate-risk and adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia in first complete remission, but the comparative value should ideally be shown in a prospective randomised study.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of radioembolization-induced tumor calcification of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated by radioembolization. Patients and Methods: This retrospective study comprised patients with single nodular HCC who underwent yttrium-90 radioembolization between November 2015 and April 2019. The presence of tumoral calcification was visually assessed on a follow-up computed tomography (CT) scan. Result(s): Fiftyfive patients (64.8+/-11.8 years, 43 men) were evaluated. Tumoral calcification was present in 21 (38.2%) of 55 patients in the one-month CT scan (calcification group). The complete response rate for the primary index tumor was 72.7% (40 of 55) in the total study population, and 100% (21 of 21) in the calcification group, respectively. The calcification group had a longer local progression-free survival rate than the noncalcification group (p=0.017). Conclusion(s): Radioembolizationinduced tumoral calcification is relatively common and can be used as an early surrogate marker of complete response.Copyright © 2020 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

2274,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included
1017,"Platelet-rich plasma as a potential therapeutic approach against lead nitrate- and/or gamma radiation-induced hepatotoxicity Because of the potential regenerative and cytoprotective effects of its content of numerous bioactive growth factors and cytokines, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) became an attractive biomaterial for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded
1509,"Ultrasonic backscatter difference measurements of cancellous bone from the human femur: Relation to bone mineral density and microstructure Ultrasonic backscatter techniques are being developed to detect changes in cancellous bone caused by osteoporosis. One technique, called the backscatter difference technique, measures the power difference between two portions of a backscatter signal. The goal of the present study is to investigate how bone mineral density (BMD) and the microstructure of human cancellous bone influence four backscatter difference parameters: the normalized mean of the backscatter difference (nMBD) spectrum, the normalized slope of the backscatter difference spectrum, the normalized intercept of the backscatter difference spectrum, and the normalized backscatter amplitude ratio (nBAR). Ultrasonic measurements were performed with a 3.5MHz broadband transducer on 54 specimens of human cancellous bone from the proximal femur. Volumetric BMD and the microstructural characteristics of the specimens were measured using x-ray micro-computed tomography. Of the four ultrasonic parameters studied, nMBD and nBAR demonstrated the strongest univariate correlations with density and microstructure. Multivariate analyses indicated that nMBD and nBAR depended on trabecular separation and possibly other microstructural characteristics of the specimens independently of BMD. These findings suggest that nMBD and nBAR may be sensitive to changes in the density and microstructure of bone caused by osteoporosis.",Excluded
2913,"Sun exposure and pterygium of the eye: a dose-response curve PURPOSE: To present a quantitative analysis of pterygium and ocular sun exposure, a dose-response curve, and a discussion of the health-promotion implications of the findings., METHODS: A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. Case subjects had surgical removal of a pterygium; control subjects had an ear, nose, or throat procedure. A lifetime history of residence, sun exposure patterns, and use of hats, spectacles, and sunglasses was obtained at interview. Measures of potential sun exposure included latitude, daily sunshine hours, and daily global solar radiant energy. The most complex estimate of actual sun exposure was the daily ocular solar radiation dose, calculated from climatic data, time spent outdoors not under shade, and the use of hats and spectacles., RESULTS: There were strong positive associations between pterygium and measures of potential and actual sun exposure. Associations were as strong for whole-life measures as for those in any specific age range. Pterygium odds ratios increased with exposure level; the odds ratio was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 10.9) for the highest quarter of the daily sun exposure. The strongest associations were seen for the estimated daily ocular solar radiation dose, with an odds ratio of 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 19.7) for the highest quarter of exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Pterygium is strongly related to ocular sun exposure, with little evidence that exposure during any particular period of life is more important than in other periods; the implication for prevention of pterygium is that ocular protection is beneficial at all ages.",Excluded
1209,"The complex relationship between lung tumor volume and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated by definitive radiotherapy: A prospective, observational prognostic factor study of the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG 99.05) Background and purpose: To investigate the hypothesis that primary tumor volume is prognostic independent of T and N stages in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by definitive radiotherapy. Material(s) and Method(s): Multicenter prospective observational study. Patient eligibility: pathologically proven stage I-III non-small cell lung cancer planned for definitive radiotherapy (minimum 50 Gy in 20 fractions) using CT-based contouring. Volumes of the primary tumor and enlarged nodes were measured according to a standardized protocol. Survival was adjusted for the effect of T and N stage. Result(s): There were 509 eligible patients. Five-year survival rates for tumor volume grouped by quartiles were, for increasing tumor volume, 22%, 14%, 15% and 21%. Larger primary tumor volume was associated with shorter survival (HR = 1.060 (per doubling); 95% CI 1.01-1.12; P = 0.029). However, after adjusting for the effects of T and N stage, there was no evidence for an association (HR = 1.029, 95% CI, 0.96-1.10, P = 0.39). There was evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume was associated with an increased risk of dying, independently of T and N stage, in the first 18 months but not beyond. Conclusion(s): In patients treated by non-surgical means we were unable to show that lung tumor volume, overall, provides additional prognostic information beyond the T and N stage (TNM, 6th edition). There is evidence, however, that larger primary tumor volume adversely affects outcome only within the first 18 months. Larger tumor size alone should not by itself exclude patients from curative (chemo)radiotherapy. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded

765,"Sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To study the distribution, extent and sonographic characterisation of radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients., METHODS: The distribution of plaques, the extent of stenosis, and the sonographic characterisation of the plaque at maximum stenosis were recorded in 71 NPC patients. The results were compared with the ultrasound results of a control group of 142 patients presenting with symptoms of cerebrovascular disease or carotid bruit., RESULTS: NPC patients had a higher incidence of carotid stenosis (77 vs. 50.7%). The common carotid arteries were most commonly affected by radiation-induced stenosis (93/142 vs. 37/284 in the control group), whereas the carotid bulb was the most commonly affected (56/284) site in the control group. Significantly more NPC patients had moderate-to-severe stenosis (21/71 vs. 27/142). Analysis of the sonographic appearance of radiation-induced and atherosclerotic plaques showed more diffuse involvement in the post-radiation group. Non-calcified plaques and intraplaque hypoechoic foci were also more frequent in the post-radiation group., CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced carotid stenosis is more diffuse in distribution, is associated with more severe luminal stenosis and has different sonographic plaque characterisation compared with carotid stenosis without radiation exposure.

1704,"A hybrid iterative reconstruction algorithm that improves the image quality of low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether a hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) algorithm improves image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CT angiography (CTA) compared with filtered back projection (FBP)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen patients (seven men, 11 women; mean age, 67.8 years) underwent retrospectively gated coronary CTA at 80 kV with a volume CT dose index (CTDI(vol)) of 18.8 mGy on a 64-MDCT scanner. CT images were reconstructed using only FBP and only HIR. For each patient, CT images subjected to the two different reconstructions were reviewed by two observers. Quantitative image quality parameters-that is, CT attenuation (HU) of the coronary arteries, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)-were calculated and compared for the two reconstruction methods and the overall image quality for each reconstruction was visually scored on a 5-point scale., RESULTS: The mean estimated effective radiation dose for 80-kV coronary CTA was 4.7 +/- 0.4 (SD) mSv. The two reconstruction methods did not significantly differ with respect to the CT attenuation of the coronary arteries. The image noise was significantly lower with HIR than with FBP (20.3 +/- 5.3 vs 49.4 +/- 12.0 HU, respectively; p < 0.01), and the CNR was significantly higher with HIR than with FBP (29.8 +/- 7.4 vs 12.7 +/- 2.9, p < 0.01). The visual scores for image quality were higher with HIR than with FBP (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The HIR algorithm can reduce image noise and improve image quality at low-tube-voltage coronary CTA.",Excluded

Method(s): Sixteen patients with renal staghorn stones of more than 35 mm in maximum length on plain X-rays were treated by shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) monotherapy with the Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP. Double-J ureteral stent was inserted to all prior to the first SWL treatment. Shock wave counts varied from 2,500 to 3,600 with a shock release frequency of 70-80 pulses per minute. The number of sessions varied from 2 to 6. The interval between the SWL sessions was around 1 month. Fragmentation rate of 20-25% of the stone load per session was considered a valid criterion for progressing to further SWL sessions. Result(s): Nine patients became stone free at the end of SWL sessions and two patients had renal stone fragments smaller than 4 mm, which were eliminated 6 months later. Two patients developed streinstrasse that was managed with ureteroscopy. Auxiliary SWL was also performed on three patients with residual ureteral calculi. The mean follow up period was 12 months. The remaining five patients underwent open surgery for incomplete stone fragmentation. No major complications developed during the follow up period. The predominant composition of stones available for analysis was struvite. Conclusion(s): Doli S EMSE 220 F-XP can be a safe and effective treatment option for renal staghorn stones on an outpatient basis. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.",Excluded

Experimental Design: Adult mice were infused with Alda-89 or vehicle before, during, and after radiotherapy. Saliva secretion was monitored weekly. Hematology, metabolic profile, and postmortem evaluation for toxicity were examined at the time of sacrifice. Alda-89 or vehicle was applied toHNCcell lines in vitro, and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with HNC in vivo with or without radiation; HNC growth was monitored. The ALDH3A1 and ALDH3A2 protein expression was evaluated in 89 patients with HNC and correlated to freedom from relapse (FFR) and overall survival (OS). Result(s): Alda-89 infusion significantly resulted in more whole saliva production and a higher percentage of preserved acini after radiotherapy compared with vehicle control. There was no difference in the complete blood count, metabolic profile, and major organ morphology between the Alda-89 and vehicle groups. Compared with vehicle control, Alda-89 treatment neither accelerated HNC cell proliferation in vitro, nor did it affect tumor growth in vivo with or without radiotherapy. Higher expression of ALDH3A1 orALDH3A2 was not significantly associated with worse FFR or OS in either human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive or HPV-negative group. Conclusion(s): Alda-89 preserves salivary function after radiotherapy without affecting HNC growth or causing measurable toxicity in mice. It is a promising candidate to mitigate radiotherapy-related xerostomia. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.",Excluded
3000,"Heliotherapy improves vitamin D balance and atopic dermatitis BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency during winter is common in the Nordic countries. Heliotherapy (HT) may heal atopic dermatitis (AD) but its effect on vitamin D balance has not been examined., OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of HT on serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration and on healing of AD., METHODS: Twenty-three adult patients with AD received a 2-week course of HT in the Canary Islands in either January or March 2005. Daily solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation was measured and personal UV exposure calculated as standard erythema doses (SED). Blood samples were taken during HT and during a 1-2 month follow-up. Serum calcidiol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Healing of AD was examined by SCORAD index., RESULTS: Before HT 17 (74%) AD patients had vitamin D insufficiency (calcidiol < 50 nmol L(-1)) and four patients high (> 80 nmol L(-1)) serum calcidiol values. The median personal UV dose during the 2-week HT course was 60 SED in the January group and 109 SED in the March group. Serum calcidiol concentration increased significantly in both groups, by 13.4 and 24.0 nmol/L(-1), respectively, and after HT only four (17%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency. SCORAD improved from 34 to 9 in the January HT group and from 30 to 9 in the March group., CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week course of HT significantly improved vitamin D balance by increasing serum calcidiol concentration, and caused a marked healing of AD. These parallel positive responses should be taken into account when the benefits of HT are considered.",Excluded

Aim(s): This research aimed to determine the anatomical image of orbital CT scan in slice thickness variations and determine the value of slice thickness, which produced optimal anatomical image information. Method(s): It was experimental research. There were 15 patients with orbital CT scans whose slice thickness was made into a 1.25 mm data row. The data row was then reconstructed with slice thickness variations into 1.25 mm, 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5 mm. Information clarity about anatomical imagery was assessed, including Nasal Bone, Optic Nerve, Sinus Ethmoidalis, Sinus Sphenoidalis, Lacrimal Bone, Cornea, Lens, Globe, and Sclera. Data analysis with Spearman test and Friedman test showed a = 5%. Result(s): There is a difference in information on anatomical images of orbital CT scan in Slice thickness variations with p-value <0.023. 2.5 mm slice thickness results in the most optimal anatomical image information with mean rank = 5.50.

1413,"3D deep learning angiography (3D-DLA) from C-arm Conebeam CT BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that has demonstrated unprecedented performance in many medical imaging applications. Our purpose was to develop a deep learning angiography method to generate 3D cerebral angiograms from a single contrast-enhanced C-arm conebeam CT acquisition in order to reduce image artifacts and radiation dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A set of 105 3D rotational angiography examinations were randomly selected from an internal data base. All were acquired using a clinical system in conjunction with a standard injection protocol. More than 150 million labeled voxels from 35 subjects were used for training. A deep convolutional neural network was trained to classify each image voxel into 3 tissue types (vasculature, bone, and soft tissue). The trained deep learning angiography model was then applied for tissue classification into a validation cohort of 8 subjects and a final testing cohort of the remaining 62 subjects. The final vasculature tissue class was used to generate the 3D deep learning angiography images. To quantify the generalization error of the trained model, we calculated the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and Dice similarity coefficients for vasculature classification in relevant anatomy. The 3D deep learning angiography and clinical 3D rotational angiography images were subjected to a qualitative assessment for the presence of intersweep motion artifacts. RESULT(S): Vasculature classification accuracy and 95% CI in the testing dataset were 98.7% (98.3%-99.1%). No residual signal from osseous structures was observed for any 3D deep learning angiography testing cases except for small regions in the otic capsule and nasal cavity compared with 37% (23/62) of the 3D rotational angiographies. CONCLUSION(S): Deep learning angiography accurately recreated the vascular anatomy of the 3D rotational angiography reconstructions without a mask. Deep learning angiography reduced misregistration artifacts induced by intersweep motion, and it reduced radiation exposure required to obtain clinically useful 3D rotational angiography.Copyright © 2018 American Society of Neuroradiology.

1221,"Radiation Exposure During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Impact of Arterial Approach and Prosthesis Type Background: The impact of novel alternative access and valve type on radiation exposure during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has not yet been evaluated. This study sought to determine the impact of a transarterial approach and prosthesis type on physician and patient exposure to radiation during TAVR. Method(s): This was a prospective study including 140 consecutive patients undergoing TAVR by transfemoral (n = 102) or transcarotid (TC) (n = 38) access at 2 centers. Implanted valves were the self-expanding Evolut R/PRO system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; n = 38) and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA; n = 102). The primary endpoint was first operator radiation exposure. The secondary endpoint was patient radiation exposure. Result(s): First operator radiation exposure was 4-fold greater during TC TAVR (P < .001). The use of a self-expanding valve was associated with a longer x-ray time (P = .015) and a 2-fold greater first operator radiation dose (P = .018). Patient radiation dose was not significantly affected by arterial approach (P = .055) or valve type (P = .095). After adjustment for potential confounders, the TC approach remained associated with a 174.8% (95% confidence interval, 80.6-318.3, P < .001) increase in first operator radiation dose, whereas the use of a self-expanding valve no longer influenced the first operator dose (P = .630). Conclusion(s): TC access and the use of a self-expanding valve were associated with a 4- and 2-fold greater first operator radiation exposure during TAVR procedures, respectively. Unlike the arterial approach, the effect of bioprosthesis type on radiation exposure was mainly related to x-ray time and was no longer significant after adjustment.Copyright © 2021 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons",Excluded

2205,"Tumor heterogeneity determined with a gammaH2AX foci assay: A study in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (hHNSCC) models Purpose This study aimed to analyze the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of gammaH2AX foci in tumor specimens following ex vivo radiation to evaluate the potential of gammaH2AX foci as predictors for radiosensitivity. Material and methods gammaH2AX foci were quantified in tumor specimens of 3 hHNSCC tumor models with known differences in radiosensitivity after reoxygenation in culture medium (10 h, 24 h), single dose exposure (0 Gy, 4 Gy), and fixation 24 h post-irradiation. Multiple, equally treated samples of the same tumor were analyzed for foci, normalized and fitted in a linear mixed-effects model. Results The ex vivo reoxygenation time had no significant effect on gammaH2AX foci counts. A significant intra model heterogeneity could be shown for FaDu (p = 0.033) but not for SKX (p = 0.167) and UT-SCC-5 (p = 0.082) tumors, respectively. All tumor models showed a significant intra-tumoral heterogeneity between specimens of the same tumor (p < 0.01) or among microscopic fields of a particular tumor specimen (p < 0.0001). Conclusion Similar results for ex vivo gammaH2AX foci between 10 h and 24 h reoxygenation time support the applicability of the assay in a clinical setting. The high intra-tumoral heterogeneity underlines the necessity of multiple analyzable samples per patient and therewith the need for an automated foci analysis.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
213,"Clinicopathologic features as stronger prognostic factors than histology or grade in risk stratification of primary parotid malignancies BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, using a retrospective chart review as the primary study design, was to determine the relative contribution of clinicopathologic risk factors versus low- and high-risk grade histologic groups to assist management of primary parotid cancers.
METHODS: In all, 168 primary parotid malignancies were treated surgically at a tertiary care center from 1982 to 2005. Of these, 115 patients with complete follow-up information were further analyzed. Pathologic updating and reclassification in 28% of cases enabled comparison of tumor histology or grade with current consensus criteria. Clinical outcomes of high- and low-risk histology and grade were compared with the influence of traditional clinicopathologic risk factors.
RESULTS: Of 115 cases, the male:female ratio was equal and the median age was 63 years (range, 15 to 89 years). Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (n = 28) was the most common histology. The median follow-up was 44 months (range, 0–278 months). Of low-risk histology patients who underwent neck dissection 40% had pN+ disease. The median time to recurrence was not reached for low-risk tumors, compared with 29 months for high-risk tumors (p = .0001). Interestingly, extracapsular spread (ECS) and margin status were independent prognostic factors and conferred significantly greater prognostic value than histologic grade risk group. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years for the entire cohort were 51% and 57%, respectively. Risk group was a strong independent predictor of OS but not DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk group defined by histology and grade was associated with DFS. ECS and margin status were independent predictors of DFS. Inclusion of ECS and margin status substantially improved the prediction of disease recurrence, supporting elective neck dissection and postoperative radiotherapy for high-grade tumors or low-risk histologies with positive margins or ECS.",Excluded
1332,"Phase I/II study of induction chemotherapy using carboplatin plus irinotecan and sequential thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for elderly patients with limited-disease smallcell lung cancer (LD-SCLC): TORG 0604 Background: The role of irinotecan for elderly patients with LD-SCLC has been unclear, and the timing of TRT combined with chemotherapy has not been fully evaluated. Method(s): Patients aged > 70 years with untreated, measurable, LD-SCLC, performance status (PS) 0-2, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment consisted of induction with carboplatin on day 1 and irinotecan on days 1 and 8, every 21 days for 4 cycles, and sequential TRT (54Gy in 27 fractions). Carboplatin doses were based on AUC of 4 and 5 (levels 1 and 2, respectively), with a fixed irinotecan dose (50 mg/m2). Primary objective of the phase II study was overall responce rate. Result(s): Forty-three patients were enrolled and forty-one were finally analyzed (median age: 75 years [range 70-86 years); males 31; PS 0/1/2, n = 22/18/1]. Two patients were excluded because of protocol violation (ascertained to be extensive disease). Twelve patients were accrued at phase I and the number of patients with carboplatin dose-limiting toxicities at levels-1 (n = 6) and -2 (n = 6) were 1(grade 3 hypertension) and 2 (grade 4 thrombocytopenia), respectively. The phase II trial was expanded to 29 additional patients receiving the level 1 carboplatin dose, total of 35 patients. The median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 (range 1-4), and the median radiation dose was 54Gy (range 36-60). Toxicities were generally mild. There were 4 complete and 27 partial responses (response rate 88.6%). With a median follow-up of 52 months, the median progression-free and overall survival times of phase II were 11.2 and 27.1 months, respectively. Conclusion(s): Induction chemotherapy of carboplatin plus irinotecan and sequential TRT was well tolerated and effective for elderly patients with LD-SCLC. Additional confirmatory studies are warranted. Trial registration: Trial registration number: UMIN000007352. Name of registry: UMIN. Date of registration: 1/Dec/2006.

1581,"Expandable metallic stent placement for malignant venous stenosis The expandable metallic stent (EMS) is used to dilate narrowed vascular or ductal lumina. We used EMS in patients with venous stenosis caused by maligant tumor. EMS were applied in 8 patients. The venogram demonstrated stenosis of vein, and the stenotic ratio were ranged 67-100%. After stent placement, all patients obtained symptomatic relief, and the stenotic ratio improved 20-60% in 7 patients. In one patient, EMS did not expand, but symptom relieved 4 days after stent placement, and following X-ray film showed expansion of EMS. One patient had recurrence of symptom 10 days after stent placement due to dislodgement of EMS. Additional EMS was placed, and symptom improved again. All 8 patients did not suffer recurrence of symptom from 3 weeks to 18 months. We conclude that EMS appears to be useful in patients with venous stenosis caused by malignant tumor.",Excluded
1347,"Suppression of experimental corneal angiogenesis by focal X-ray irradiation PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of focal X-ray irradiation on experimental corneal angiogenesis in the rabbit., METHODS: A gelatin hydrogel sheet impregnated with basic fibroblast growth factor was implanted into the corneal stroma of rabbits; this induced corneal angiogenesis. After the first sign of corneal angiogenesis was noted, the corneal region was irradiated with a dose of 10 Gy or 20 Gy. The control rabbits received no irradiation. The eyes were examined by slitlamp biomicroscopy and photographed, over a period of 28 days. The maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were quantified by computerized image analysis., RESULTS: Corneal angiogenesis was noted on day 3 following implantation of the hydrogel sheet. In the rabbits irradiated with 10 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were both significantly lower on day 4 and 7 following irradiation, compared to the respective measurement in the controls. In the rabbits irradiated with 20 Gy, the maximum length and total surface area of corneal angiogenesis were significantly lower between days 4 and 21, and between days 4 and 14, respectively, compared to the respective measurement in the controls., CONCLUSIONS: Focal X-ray irradiation to the corneal region suppressed corneal angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Focal X-ray irradiation may be beneficial in treating ocular angiogenesis.",Included

Patients and Methods: Between February 1986 and September 1989, 65 patients were entered in the first trial (GOTHA I), and between December 1989 and October 1992 67 were enrolled in the second trial (GOTHA II). In both protocols, radiotherapy (RT) was administered twice daily, at 6 h intervals, 5 days a week, to a total dose of 63 Gy in 42 fractions of 1.5 Gy. RT was given during weeks 2, 3, 6, and 7, over an elapsed time of 6 weeks. In GOTHA I, three cycles of cisplatin, 60 mg/m2 day 1, mitomycin, 8 mg/m2 day 1, and vindesin 3 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week, were given during weeks 1, 5, and 9; in GOTHA II, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 1 and vinblastin 5 mg/m2 day 1 and the first day of the following week were given during weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Result(s): With a minimum follow-up of 3 years, the 1-, 2-, 5-, and 8-year overall survival probability was 56% (95% CI 47-64%), 27% (20-35%), 12% (7- 18%) and 9% (3-16%), respectively, with a median survival of 13.6 months (11.4-16.8). Median follow-up for survivors was 6 years (3.3-9.9). There were no survival differences between Stages IIIA and IIIB (p = 0.84), performance status 0, 1, 2 (p = 0.87), sex (p = 0.45) or between the two treatment protocols. At this time, 14 patients are alive, and 118 have died: 102 from NSCLC, 4 from acute toxicity, 2 from secondary surgery, 4 from other medical causes, and 6 from unknown causes. Correlation between response and long- term survival was poor, since of the 24 patients who survived 3 years or more, only 6 (25%) were classified as having a complete response; the remainder having either a partial response (11, 46%), no change (6, 25%), or 'progressive disease' (1,4%). First site of relapse was local in 31% of these cases, distant in 43%, local and distant in 15%, and unknown in 11%. Main grade 3-4 acute toxicities were nausea-vomiting (17%), mucositis (15%), leukopenia (41%), and thrombocytopenia (11%). Eight patients presented with grade 3-4 symptomatic lung radiation pneumopathy. Conclusion(s): Based on this experience with 132 patients, this combination of alternated RT and chemotherapy (CT) for inoperable Stage III NSCLC is feasible with acceptable toxicity, and long-term results suggest a gain in survival when compared to those obtained with conventional RT alone. However, the still high local and distant failure rates indicate that both local and systemic therapies need to be improved.",Excluded
477,"Infrastructure of radiotherapy in the Netherlands: Evaluation of prognoses and introduction of a new model for determining the needs Background and purpose: In the Netherlands, the radiotherapy infrastructure is regulated by a Governmental license system. This requires timely and realistic prognostication of the needs for radiotherapy. In the present study, the latest prognoses (1993) and the realized changes in infrastructure are evaluated and a new prognosis for the period until 2010, which has been calculated using a new model, is presented. Material(s) and Method(s): Data on cancer incidence and use of radiotherapy were obtained from various published national reports and from a survey of all radiotherapy departments. Result(s): The cancer incidence over the period 1993-1997 was about 10% higher than predicted. In 1996 and 1997, the percentage of new cancer patients treated with radiotherapy was 45.6 and 48.2%, respectively. The absolute number of newly irradiated patients was about 10% higher than foreseen in the prognosis. The needs for radiotherapy infrastructure not only depend on epidemiological data and changes in indications for radiotherapy, but also on changes in types of treatment with different workloads. A new model, which uses four categories for teletherapy and four categories for brachytherapy is described and a new prognosis for the required number of linear accelerators and staff up to the year 2010 is presented. Conclusion(s): The original prognosis on cancer incidence and radiotherapy patients underestimated the actual figures considerably. The new prognosis, based on a model, which not only accounts for an increase in number of patients, but also for changes in treatment techniques, is expected to more accurately predict and acquire the required radiotherapy capacity. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

1170,"Rapid detection of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in lymphocytes and hematopoietic progenitor cells by mFISH Structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) are sensitive indicators of a preceding exposure of the hematopoietic system to ionizing radiation. Cytogenetic investigations have therefore become routine tools for an assessment of absorbed radiation doses and their biological effects after occupational exposure or radiation accidents.Due to its speed and ease of use, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole chromosome painting (WCP) probes has become a method of choice to visualize SCAs. Until recently, this technique was limited to a rather small number of chromosomes, which could be tested simultaneously. As a result, only a fraction of the structural aberrations present in a sample could be detected and the overall dose effect had to be calculated by extrapolation. The recent introduction of two genome-wide screening techniques in tumor research, i.e., Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) and multicolor FISH (mFISH) now allows the detection of translocations involving any two non-homologous chromosomes.The present study was prompted by our desire to bring the power of mFISH to bear for the rapid identification of radiation-induced SCAs. We chose two model systems to investigate the utility of mFISH: lymphocytes that were exposed in vitro to 3 Gy photons and single hematopoietic progenitor cell colonies isolated from a Chernobyl victim 9 years after in vivo exposure to 5.4 Sv.In lymphocytes, we found up to 15 different chromosomes involved in rearrangements indicating complex radiation effects. Stable aberrations detected in hematopoietic cell colonies, on the other hand, showed involvement of up to three different chromosomes. These results demonstrated that mFISH is a rapid and powerful approach to detect and characterize radiation-induced SCAs in the hemopoietic system. The application of mFISH is expected to result in a more detailed and, thus, more informative picture of radiation effects. Eventually, this technique will allow researchers to rapidly delineate chromosomal breakpoints and facilitate the identification of the genes involved in radiation tumorigenesis.

279,"Role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in DNA strand break repair through homologous recombination In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Swi5 interacts in vitro with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed in vivo by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in Swi5(-/-) and Sfr1(-/-) cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.",Excluded
2439,"Post-treatment skin reactions reported by cancer patients differ by race, not by treatment or expectations Cancer patients may experience skin problems while undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Frequency of skin reactions may be influenced by skin pigmentation and psychological factors. A Symptom Inventory completed by 656 cancer patients nationwide before and after chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy was analysed to determine if treatment type, race (Black vs White), and pretreatment expectations influenced post-treatment skin reactions. Subsequent analysis of a local Symptom Inventory completed weekly for 5 weeks by 308 patients receiving radiation therapy examined severity of reported skin reactions. Significantly more patients receiving radiation therapy had stronger expectations of skin problems (62%) than patients receiving chemotherapy (40%, P=0.001) or chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (45%, P=0.003). Overall, expectations did not correlate with patient reported post-treatment skin problems in white (r=0.014, P=0.781) or black (r=0.021, P=0.936) patients. Although no significant difference was found between black and white patients in their pretreatment expectations of skin problems (P=0.32), black patients (10 out of 18, 56%) reported more skin problems than white patients (90 out of 393, 23%, P=0.001). Similarly, the local study showed that significantly more black patients (1 out of 5, 20%) reported severe skin reactions at the treatment site than white patients (12 out of 161, 8%). A direct correlation was observed between severity of skin problems and pain at the treatment site (r=0.541, P<0.001). Total radiation exposure did not significantly correlate with the report of skin problems at the treatment site for white or black patients. Overall, black patients reported more severe post-treatment skin problems than white patients. Our results suggest that symptom management for post-treatment skin reactions in cancer patients receiving radiation treatment could differ depending on their racial background.",Excluded

This study compares the transbronchial route with augmented fluoroscopic bronchoscopy (AFB) and conventional transthoracic CT-guided methods for preoperative dye localization in thoracoscopic surgery., METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2019, a total of 231 patients with small pulmonary lesions who received preoperative dye localization via AFB or percutaneous CT-guided technique were enrolled in the study. A propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative variables, was used to compare localization and surgical outcomes between the two groups., RESULTS: After matching, a total of 90 patients in the AFB group (N = 30) and CT-guided group (N = 60) were selected for analysis. No significant difference was noted in the demographic data between both the groups. Dye localization was successfully performed in 29 patients (96.7%) and 57 patients (95%) with AFB and CT-guided method, respectively. The localization duration (24.1 +/- 8.3 vs. 21.4 +/- 12.5 min, p = 0.297) and equivalent dose of radiation exposure (3.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 2.5 +/- 2.0 mSv, p = 0.130) were comparable in both the groups. No major procedure-related complications occurred in either group; however, a higher rate of pneumothorax (0 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.029) and focal intrapulmonary hemorrhage (3.3 vs. 26.7%, p = 0.008) was noted in the CT-guided group., CONCLUSION: AFB dye marking is an effective alternative for the preoperative localization of small pulmonary lesions, with a lower risk of procedure-related complications than the conventional CT-guided method.",Excluded
3206,"Do persons living near a uranium processing site have evidence of increased somatic cell gene mutations? A first study The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included

In the UK, use of denosumab was approved by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) from October 2010 (TA204) [1]. Denosumab was used in Rheumatology Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, London from October 2010. Objectives We audited the indications for use of denosumab in these patients. Drug compliance, adverse effect and tolerability of the drug were also analysed. Methods 81 patients (female 77, male 4, age range 52 to 92 years, mean age 72 years) who commenced denosumab between October 2010 and December 2011 were identified retrospectively. 97% (79/81) of the patients come from their own home and 3% (2/81) come from nursing home. Patients' demographics, risk factors, fracture history, bone mineral density (BMD), spine and hip T score and previous osteoporosis treatment were assessed. 58 patients had follow up data and renal function was monitored every six months. Side effects were documented. Results Pre-treatment Dual-emission X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) was available on all patients (mean BMD spine and hip 0.686 gm/cm2 and 0.705 gm/cm2, mean T score spine and hip -3.025 and -1.776). 87% (75/81) had failed treatment with both oral and intravenous bisphosphonates. 11% (9/81) had breast cancer and were on aromatase inhibitors. 16% (13/81) had mild renal impairment and 7% (6/81) had moderate renal impairment at the base line. 35.8% (29/81) of patients were found to have vitamin D deficiency at baseline and were treated. 9% (7/81) were on denosumab treatment for primary prevention of osteoporosis (T score range -2.3 to -4.1). All of these had failed oral medication previously. Four patients swapped from intravenous Ibandronate due to poor venous access. Use of denosumab was indicated clinically despite lack of specific risk factors suggested by NICE. All patients treated with denosumab for secondary prevention of osteoporosis (91%,74/81) met NICE criteria by virtue of previous fracture and failure of other treatments. Four men were treated off-license. 44% (36/81) had completed six month treatment and 27% (22/81) had completed one year treatment. All these patients were compliant to the drug.

2178,"The degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs negatively influence union rate of osteoporotic vertebral fracture: A multicenter cohort study Background: With the increasing aging population in developed countries, there has been an associated increased prevalence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF). Many previous reports have attempted to predict the risk of delayed union associated with OVF. However, the role of endplate failure and the degeneration of adjacent intervertebral discs, and their association with delayed union has received little attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the endplate fracture and disc degeneration rank as risk factors for delayed union. Material(s) and Method(s): Two hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with fresh OVF were enrolled in the study. MRI and X-ray were performed at the time of enrollment and at the 6 months follow-up. The MR images were used to assess the degeneration grade of adjacent intervertebral discs (using the modified Pfirrmann grading system), and endplate failure. Supine and weight-bearing radiographs were used to define angular motion and compression ratio of the anterior vertebral body wall. Result(s): A total of 139 patients (112 female, 27 male) completed the 6 month follow-up (a 65.1% follow-up rate). The study revealed 27 cases of delayed union (19.4%). A healthier adjacent caudal disc with low grade degeneration was found to be associated with an increased risk of delayed union (P = 0.008). Bi-endplate injury and significant compression of the anterior vertebral body wall were significantly associated with delayed union (P = 0.019, and P = 0.001 respectively). Rapid progression of the adjacent cranial disc degeneration was observed at the end of the 6 month follow-up period (P = 0.001). Conclusion(s): Modified Pfirrmann grading system revealed that a healthier adjacent intervertebral disc at the caudal level and bi-endplate fracture were significantly associated with an increased risk of delayed union. These findings may influence the management strategy for patients with OVF.Copyright © 2018",Excluded

486,"Classification of benign and malignant breast lesions in ultrasound images using support vector machines One of the most common diseases prevalent among women is Breast cancer. In general, Mammography is applied for the detection of the breast cancer, whereas, the technique of Mammography makes use of the ionizing radiation. As a result, this technique does not detect the breast cancer in women having dense breast. In the beginning phases of malignancy, radiologist could experience the challenges in identifying the lesions. Hence, there is a need for one more screen test for the confirmation of the cancer. On the other hand, Sonography is also commonly used for the detection and classification of abnormalities of the breast owing to its cost-effectiveness, comfort level of patient, and non-ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, ultrasound images seem to be low contrast images as well as the physician could encounter the possible challenges in the identification of the lesions. Therefore, there has been an inevitable requirement in the development of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for the purpose of classifying breast lesion in an accurate manner. This paper aims at the analyzing the Morphological and Fractal features in an effective manner for differentiating benign as well as malignant masses from ultrasound images.

1404,"Technological Advances in Arrhythmia Management Applied to Adults With Congenital Heart Disease Arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity in adults with congenital heart disease. Numerous challenges to managing arrhythmias include vascular access issues, intracardiac shunts, unconventional locations of the conduction system, and anatomical complexities. Technological advances are improving our ability to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. Implantable loop recorders and various technologies developed for consumers to record electrocardiographic tracings using smartphone applications, watches, and dedicated portable devices are expanding our armamentarium of diagnostic tools. Remote magnetic-guided catheter ablation is enhancing access to otherwise difficult to reach arrhythmia substrates. Cryoablation allows perinodal arrhythmias to be safely treated in patients with displaced or difficult to predict locations of the atrioventricular conduction system. Interventions that minimize radiation exposure to near 0 levels are gaining interest and pulmonary vein isolation procedures to treat atrial fibrillation are increasingly performed. Cardiac implantable electronic devices compatible with magnetic resonance imaging have become the norm. Subcutaneous defibrillators and leadless pacemakers are providing effective solutions to patients in whom transvenous leads are contraindicated or not desired. His-bundle pacing is emerging as a viable option to provide more physiological pacing. Progressive advances in multicomponent communicating leadless devices carry the promise of providing leadless dual chamber pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy in the near future. The safety of transvenous lead extraction procedures is likely to improve with advances such as the low-pressure balloon to manage superior vena cava lacerations. Awareness of these developments and referral to sites with dedicated expertise could contribute to further improving outcomes in adults with congenital heart disease.

3315,"The use of autologous platelet and plasma products in salvage neck dissections: a prospective clinical study evaluating early and late wound healing OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of autologous platelet and plasma adhesives (APA) on postoperative drainage and soft-tissue fibrosis following neck dissections., DESIGN: This was a blinded comparative prospective cohort study done as two parts: part one evaluated early post-surgical outcomes and part two evaluated late tissue fibrosis., METHOD: Salvage neck dissections were stratified into two groups based on severity of prior treatment. High risk patients were defined as those who had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and autologous platelet adhesives were administered to the surgical wound intraoperatively. The low risk group consisted of patients undergoing salvage neck dissections following radiation only and acted as controls. Part one evaluated postsurgical wound drainage as the primary outcome as well as length of hospital stay and complications. Part two evaluated late postoperative tissue fibrosis by comparing neck skin using the Cutometer. R2 and F0 were the specific Cutometer parameters for quantifying the viscoelastic properties of the skin., RESULTS: Postoperative wound drainage was significantly less (253.7 vs. 345.8) in the autologous platelet adhesive group as compared to the control group (p less than 0.03). Length of stay in the APA group versus the control group was 3.13 and 3.86 days respectively (p less than 0.004). Both R2 and F0 measurements showed improved viscoelastic properties of the skin in the APA group (R2 p less than 0.05, F0 p less than 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: APA application following salvage neck dissections may reduce early postperative wound drainage and improve long-term skin quality.",Excluded
588,"Validation of a decision instrument for selective chest imaging in blunt trauma IMPORTANCE Chest radiography (chest x-ray [CXR] and chest computed tomography [CT]) is the most common imaging in blunt trauma evaluation. Unnecessary trauma imaging leads to greater costs, emergency department time, and patient exposure to ionizing radiation. OBJECTIVE To validate our previously derived decision instrument (NEXUS Chest) for identification of blunt trauma patients with very low risk of thoracic injury seen on chest imaging (TICI).We hypothesized that NEXUS Chest would have high sensitivity (>98%) for the prediction of TICI and TICI with major clinical significance. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From December 2009 to January 2012, we enrolled blunt trauma patients older than 14 years who received chest radiography in this prospective, observational, diagnostic decision instrument study at 9 US level I trauma centers. Prior to viewing radiographic results, physicians recorded the presence or absence of the NEXUS Chest 7 clinical criteria (age >60 years, rapid deceleration mechanism, chest pain, intoxication, abnormal alertness/mental status, distracting painful injury, and tenderness to chest wall palpation). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thoracic injury seen on chest imagingwas defined as pneumothorax, hemothorax, aortic or great vessel injury, 2 or more rib fractures, ruptured diaphragm, sternal fracture, and pulmonary contusion or laceration seen on radiographs. An expert panel generated an a priori classification of clinically major, minor, and insignificant TICIs according to associated management changes. RESULTS Of 9905 enrolled patients, 43.1%had a single CXR, 42.0% had CXR and chest CT, 6.7%had CXR and abdominal CT (without chest CT), 5.5%had multiple CXRs without CT, and 2.6%had chest CT alone in the emergency department. The most common trauma mechanisms were motorized vehicle crash (43.9%), fall (27.5%), pedestrian struck by motorized vehicle (10.7%), bicycle crash (6.3%), and struck by blunt object, fists, or kicked (5.8%). Thoracic injury seen on chest imaging was seen in 1478 (14.9%) patients with 363 (24.6%) of these having major clinical significance, 1079 (73.0%) minor clinical significance, and 36 (2.4%) no clinical significance. NEXUS Chest had a sensitivity of 98.8% (95%CI, 98.1%-99.3%), a negative predictive value of 98.5%(95%CI, 97.6%.6-99.1%), and a specificity of 13.3%(95%CI, 12.6%-14.1%) for TICI. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for TICI with clinically major injury were 99.7%(95%CI, 98.2%-100.0%) and 99.9% (95%CI, 99.4%-100.0%), respectively.

1983,"Central command and metaboreflex cardiovascular responses to sustained handgrip during microgravity Four subjects were studied before and during a 16-day space flight. The test included 2min of rest, 2min of sustained handgrip (SHG), and 2min of post-exercise circulatory occlusion (PECO). Heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) responses to central command and mechanoreceptor stimulation were determined from the difference between SHG and PECO. Responses to metaboreceptor stimulation were determined from the difference between PECO and rest. Late in-flight (days 12-14) the central command/mechanoreceptor component of the HR response was reduced by 5bpm (P=0.01) from its pre-flight value of 15 (+/-3)bpm (mean (+/-SEM)). At the same time the metaboreflex responses of HR and MAP were unchanged. The attenuated HR response to central command was likely of baroreflex origin. Together with a parallel study of PECO after dynamic leg exercise, our data indicate that central processing of metaboreflex inputs is unchanged in microgravity whereas metaboreflex inputs from weight-bearing muscles are enhanced.",Excluded
2499,"Papillary thyroid carcinoma with exclusive involvement of a functioning recurrent laryngeal nerve may be treated with shaving technique OBJECTIVES: We sought to validate the feasibility of preserving a functioning recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) invaded by papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) using a shaving technique followed by high-dose radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy., METHODS: A retrospective review of 34 patients with locally invasive PTC who had exclusive tumor involvement of a functioning RLN was performed. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy and high-dose RAI therapy. A shaving technique was conducted with the goal of leaving the smallest amount of residual tumor as possible while attempting to preserve nerve function. Clinicopathologic factors and oncologic outcomes of the patients with resected RLN (group A, n = 14) and preserved RLN (group B, n = 20) were compared., RESULTS: The two groups showed no differences in clinicopathologic factors or follow-up period. Mean dose of radioiodine therapy was 245.0 +/- 140.3 mCi (range 100-540 mCi). Permanent postoperative vocal cord paralysis after RLN shaving occurred in two patients of group B (10%). Only one patient (5%) in group B had local recurrence at the thyroid bed where the residual tumor was located. The overall recurrence rate was 35.7% (5/14) and 20.0% (4/20) in groups A and B, respectively showing no significant difference (p = 0.525). There were no cases of death due to PTC during the median follow-up of 75 months (range 36-159 months)., CONCLUSIONS: Patients with locally invasive PTC with exclusive involvement of a functioning RLN may be treated by nerve shaving followed by treatment of the macroscopic residual tumor with high-dose RAI therapy.",Excluded
1077,"Combined concomitant boost radiotherapy and chemotherapy in stage III-IV head and neck carcinomas: a comparison of toxicity and treatment results with those observed after radiotherapy alone BACKGROUND: Alteration of radiation therapy (RT) fractionation and the combination of chemotherapy (CT) with RT represent two predominant fields of current research in the treatment of head and neck carcinomas. To assess the potential integration of these two fields, a retrospective comparison of toxicity and treatment outcome was carried out in stage III-IV patients treated with a concomitant boost RT schedule with or without CT., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were treated by RT alone and 35 by RT and CT. In the RT group, there were significantly fewer T3-4 tumors (56% vs. 88%, P = 0.002) and higher proportion of planned neck dissections (35% vs. 14%, P = 0.047). The planned total dose was 69.9 Gy delivered over 5.5 weeks. In 10 cases CT was given before RT and in 25 concomitantly with RT, either alone or with neoadjuvant and/ or adjuvant CT. All patients but two had cisplatin-based (CDDP, 100 mg/m2) CT, associated in 28 patients with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 1000 mg/m2/24 h x 5). The median follow-up for the surviving patients was 21 and 31 months for the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., RESULTS: Grade 3-4 acute toxicity (RTOG) was observed in 73% and 36% of patients, and grade 3 dysphagia in 31% and 57% (P = 0.02) respectively in the RT and RT-CT groups. The rates of grade 3-4 late complications were similar in the two groups (5% vs. 12%). At three years, actuarial loco-regional control (LRC) was 57% and 66% (P = 0.66) and overall survival was 56% and 47% (P = 0.99) in the RT and RT-CT groups respectively., CONCLUSIONS: While acute toxicity was higher compared with RT alone, this accelerated RT schedule was feasible in association with 5-FU/CDDP, even administered concomitantly. Despite the significant proportion of more advanced disease in the RT-CT group, LRC was similar to that obtained by RT alone. Combinations of concomitant boost RT and chemotherapy merit further investigation in prospective trials.",Excluded
2667,"Postoperative low-dose follow-up computed tomography for patients with stomach cancer: Optimal blending ratio of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction for image quality and diagnostic performance OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction applied low-dose computed tomography (CT) (LDCT) with that of the standard-dose CT (SDCT) for local recurrence in patients with stomach cancer. METHOD(S): Seventy-nine consecutive patients who had undergone surgical resection for stomach cancer were enrolled. To monitor recurrence, SDCT (120 kilovolt peak [kVp], 200mAs) had been performed. The LDCT (120 kVp, 100 mA s) was taken, and images were reconstructed with 4 levels of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) blending (0%, 30%, 50%, and 70%). Two blinded radiologists recorded the diagnostic confidence scores for local recurrence in each data set using a 5-point scale. Endoscopic biopsy results served as the reference standard. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to calculate the diagnostic performance. RESULT(S): The diagnostic performance of LDCT with variable ASIR blending ratios was comparable to that of SDCT (area under ROC curve, 0.727-0.734, 0.687, respectively, P > 0.05). CONCLUSION(S): The diagnostic performance of ASIR applied LDCT is comparable to that of SDCT. Copyright © 2014 by Lippincott Williams &Wilkins.",Excluded
3402,"Effectiveness of salvage radiation therapy following subtotal and gross total resection of atypical meningiomas Purpose/Objective(s): Postoperative management of WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma remains controversial. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded
2514,"Comparison of dynamic expiratory CT with bronchoscopy for diagnosing airway malacia: A pilot evaluation Objective: To assess the accuracy of dynamic expiratory CT for detecting airway malacia using bronchoscopy as the diagnostic ""gold standard."" Material(s) and Method(s): A computerized hospital information system was used to retrospectively identify all patients with bronchoscopically proven airway malacia referred for CT airway imaging at our institution during a 19-month period. CT was performed within I week of bronchoscopy. All patients were scanned with a standard protocol, including end-inspiratory and dynamic expiratory volumetric imaging, using an eight-detector multislice helical CT scanner. For both CT and bronchoscopy, malacia was defined as >= 50% expiratory reduction of the airway lumen. CT and bronchoscopic findings were subsequently jointly reviewed by the radiologist and bronchoscopist for concordance. Result(s): Twenty-nine patients (12 men and 17 women; mean age, 60 years; range, 36 to 79 years) comprised the study cohort. CT correctly diagnosed malacia in 28 of 29 patients (97%). The most common presenting symptoms were dyspnea in 20 patients (69%), severe or persistent cough in 16 patients (55%), and recurrent infection in 7 patients (24%). The estimated radiation dose (expressed as dose-length product) for the dual-phase study is 508 mGy-cm, which is comparable to a routine chest CT. Conclusion(s): Dynamic expiratory CT is a highly sensitive method for detecting airway malacia and has the potential to serve as an effective, noninvasive test for diagnosing this condition.",Excluded
277,"Intestinal and colonic motor alterations associated with irradiation-induced diarrhoea in rats Localized application of ionizing radiation to the gastrointestinal tract frequently elicits responses, which include diarrhoea. The origin of this symptom is not clear but has been attributed to loss of epithelial integrity, together with alterations in motility and increased secretion. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a 10 Gy abdominal gamma irradiation leads to an inflammatory reaction, and to compare intestinal and colonic motility in controls and abdominally irradiated rats 1, 3 and 7 days after irradiation, using an electromyographic technique. The motility parameters analysed were the frequency and velocity of propagation of migrating myoelectric complexes (MMC) in the jejunum and colonic spike activity (long spike bursts; LSB) per 10 min in fasted rats. The MMC frequency was significantly reduced on days 1 and 7 after irradiation and the MMC pattern was markedly disrupted on day 3. The frequency of colonic LSB was significantly reduced on days 1, 3 and 7. Mouth to anus transit was significantly accelerated on day 3 only and diarrhoea was observed at this time. Myeloperoxidase activity in the jejunum and colon was also increased on this day only. It is concluded that irradiation-induced diarrhoea occurs contemporaneously with disruption of MMC in the small intestine.",Included
1278,"Clinical experience with a 3D surface patient setup system for alignment of partial-breast irradiation patients Purpose: To assess the utility of surface imaging on patient setup for accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI). Methods and Material: A photogrammetry system was used in parallel to APBI setup by laser and portal imaging. Surface data were acquired after laser and port-film setup for 9 patients. Surfaces were analyzed in comparison to a reference surface from the first treatment session by use of rigid transformations. The surface model after laser setup was used in a simulated photogrammetry setup procedure. In addition, breathing data were acquired by surface acquisition at a frame rate of 7 Hz. Result(s): Mean 3D displacement was 7.3 mm (SD, 4.4 mm) and 7.6 mm (SD, 4.2 mm) for laser and port film, respectively. Simulated setup with the photogrammetry system yielded mean displacement of 1 mm (SD, 1.2 mm). Distance analysis resulted in mean distances of 3.7 mm (SD, 4.9 mm), 4.3 mm (SD, 5.6 mm), and 1.6 mm (SD, 2.4 mm) for laser, port film, and photogrammetry, respectively. Breathing motion at isocenter was smaller than 3.7 mm, with a mean of 1.9 mm (SD, 1.1 mm). Conclusion(s): Surface imaging for PBI setup appears promising. Alignment of the 3D breast surface achieved by stereo-photogrammetry shows greater breast topology congruence than when patients are set up by laser or portal imaging. A correlation of breast surface and CTV must be quantitatively established. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3237,"The protective effects of ambroxol on radiation lung injury and influence on production of transforming growth factor beta1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha The aim of this article was to investigate the effect of ambroxol on radiation lung injury and the expression of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in plasma. Totally, 120 patients with locally advanced lung cancer in radiotherapy were randomized into treatment and control groups. Patients in the treatment group took ambroxol orally at a dosage of 90 mg, three times per day for 3 months from the beginning of radiotherapy. The expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha in plasma was analyzed. The clinical symptoms and lung diffusing capacity were monitored using high resolving power computed tomography. The level of TGF-beta1 in the control group was increased (11.8 +/- 5.5 ng/ml), whereas in ambroxol-treated patients, the increase was not significant (5.6 +/- 2.6 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Radiotherapy-induced elevation of TNF-alpha levels, seen in control patients, was also abolished after treatment with ambroxol (5.1 +/- 1.0 vs. 2.4 +/- 0.8 ng/ml, P < 0.001). In the treatment group, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was not significantly decreased at 6, 12, and 18 months post-radiotherapy, compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Ambroxol decreased the expression of TGF-beta1 and TNF-alpha, and minimized the diminishment of lung diffusion capacity after radiotherapy. © 2009 Humana Press Inc.",Excluded

Blood flow parameters 1 cm below the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (mean velocity time averaged, lumen diameter, resistivity index-RI) as well as perivascular reaction, were recorded on Color Doppler Imaging video tapes in a series of five consecutive examinations up to six months postirradiation. There were no statistically significant changes shown between the initial and follow-up examinations for any of the parameters investigated. There was no difference in blood flow between the ipsilateral (operated-irradiated) and contralateral side of the neck. Results did not seem to correlate with known vascular disease risk factors such as sex, arterial pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking and diabetes. After the effect of age was controlled, flow measurements remained statistically stable. Radiation dosage did not appear to influence carotid flow parameters. Perivascular reaction had the highest peak immediately postirradiation but regressed with time. This study suggests that therapeutic radiation of the neck at this dose level may not have important effects on the maxillofacial region blood supply for approximately eight months postoperatively; however, these patients should be closely evaluated for symptoms or signs of carotid artery lesions on a long-term basis.",Excluded

Between October 2010 and November 2011, one and four patients having T2 and T3 tumors, respectively, were treated with HDR-ISBT. Multiplane implantation using 9-15 treatment applicators was performed. Lugol's iodine staining, metal markers, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to identify the contours of the gross tumor volume (defined as the CTV). The results of the image-based treatment plan were compared with those of the conventional simulated plan on the basis of a reference point 5 mm from the applicator position. The mean D90(CTV) and V100(CTV) were 112% of the prescribed dose (PD) and 98.1%PD, respectively, for the image-based plan, and 113%PD and 97.2%PD, respectively, for the conventional plan.

Using data from our hospital information system, we selected patients assigned a trauma code, according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases, and with three or more body lesions assessed by CT at the same time in the emergency department. Each CT conducted was categorized into 'CT related to the final diagnosis' or 'CT unrelated to final diagnosis'. The characteristics and estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to the final diagnosis were analyzed. The factors affecting the estimated effective dose of CTs unrelated to final diagnosis were investigated., Results. More than half of all CT examinations were not associated with the final diagnosis. The additional estimated effective dose due to CTs being unrelated to the final diagnosis in each patient was a sufficient amount of radiation exposure to increase the possibility of fatal cancer., Introduction. Computed tomography (CT) has many diagnostic advantages, spurring growth in the number of CT examinations. As the use of CT increases, the potential for radiation-induced adverse effects has become an issue. The primary objective of this study was to assess the liberal use of CT induced radiation exposure in patients with multiple blunt traumas. The secondary objective was to investigate the factors affecting the estimated effective dose resulting from CTs unrelated to final diagnosis., Conclusion. A considerable number of CT scans were unrelated to the patient's final diagnosis, which exposes the patient to additional radiation exposure.Copyright ©, Pharmamed Mado Ltd.

Design and method: We analyzed 292 ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data of AH patients without serious concomitant diseases. The difference between clinical and ambulatory blood pressure level was assessed as the difference between clinical BP measurement and mean daytime BP. The inclusion criteria were: > 6-days wash-out period; two ABPM (SpaceLabs 90207) sessions before treatment and during treatment; daytime BP before treatment > 140/90 and < 160/110 mmHg; 2-3 months treatment period with mean therapeutic doses.

We used Spearman Partial Coefficient for correlation analysis adjusted for age, sex and duration of AH. Result(s): We found that all antihypertensive drugs significantly decreased systolic and diastolic BP (SBP, DBP) levels. Long-term BB therapy significantly reduced difference between systolic and diastolic clinical and ambulatory blood pressure diastolic. Antihypertensive treatment with other drugs has not significantly reduced the difference between clinical and ambulatory blood pressure (see table).

287,"Expanded Characterization of a Hemi-Body Shielded Gottingen Minipig Model of Radiation-induced Gastrointestinal Injury Incorporating Oral Dosing Procedures In collaboration with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the authors recently conducted a pilot study in a hemi-body shielded model of radiation-induced gastrointestinal (GI) injury in Gottingen minipigs following exposure to radiation dose levels between 8-16 Gy. Herein, the impact of oral dosing procedures is assessed, as well as the specific causes of death in animals exposed to radiation doses of 14 and 16 Gy (n = 64; 32 male, 32 female, between 6 and 8 mo of age). Oral dosing using a 2-tablet placebo system comprised of both immediate release and enteric-coated tablets starting 24 h post-irradiation resulted in inhibited gastric emptying of the enteric-coated tablets, which were found to be retained in the stomach and/or regurgitated. This finding appears to be species-specific, as similar findings have not been reported for other large animal species (e.g., non-human primates). Mortality was primarily dictated by decreased activity, body weight loss (>35%), and/or respiratory distress, despite shielding of the lung. The cause of respiratory distress in animals that were pre-terminally euthanized varied according to the timing of death, with interstitial inflammation and extensive fibrosis observed >20 days post-irradiation. Kidney damage was also identified in most animals after day 10. Changes in the GI tract were consistent with previous studies and included collagen deposition/fibrosis. Observations of inflammatory infiltrates and interstitial inflammation/fibrosis in both shielded and unshielded organs support a strong secondary inflammatory syndrome post-irradiation.",Included
1554,"Endovascular Treatment of Long Superficial Femoral Artery-Chronic Total Occlusions Using the Gogo Catheter With IVUS Via a Popliteal Puncture Method Is Effective, Safe, and Useful Objectives: We aimed to investigate the usefulness of inserting a 6Fr sheath guided by duplex ultrasonography via a popliteal artery puncture. We also aimed to demonstrate endoluminal tracking using a retrograde approach using the Gogo catheter with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Background(s): The bidirectional approach is useful for increasing the success rate of the procedure for long superficial femoral artery-chronic total occlusions (SFA-CTOs). However, this procedure becomes somewhat complicated. Since the proximal blood vessel diameter is clearly larger than the distal end of the CTO and the body surface duplex guide can also be used in the proximal part, it is easier to introduce a retrograde guidewire (GW) into the proximal end. Method(s): We performed endovascular treatment for long SFA-CTOs with a Gogo catheter + IVUS guide in 31 consecutive cases (male 20/female 11; mean age, 75.6 +/- 7.6) from May 2017 to November 2018. We advanced the IVUS until the true lumen could be confirmed and advanced the Gogo catheter toward the IVUS for reinforcement. We attempted to approach the long CTO by repeating this procedure. We named this procedure the GIP method (GIP: Gogo catheter with IVUS via a popliteal puncture). Hemostasis of the popliteal artery was achieved using a commercially available compression hemostatic kit (Tometa-kun, XEMEX, Japan). Result(s): Successful revascularization was achieved in all cases (in 2 cases, a femoral artery puncture was added, and a bidirectional approach was used, and in 1 case, a CROSSER system was used). On average, the fluoroscopy time was 42.2 +/- 30.4 minutes, radiation dose 93.7 +/- 78.7 mGy, and amount of contrast medium used 15.0 +/- 9.6 mL. The procedure time was defined as from the start of the popliteal artery puncture to the time the GW passed through the CTO lesion, including the posture transformation time from prone to the supine position. The procedure time was 42.1 +/- 40.2 minutes. There were no major adverse events or other major complications, such as a distal embolism, rupture of the CTO lesion, arteriovenous fistula, or major hematoma requiring a transfusion or surgical treatment. Only 2 small hematomas occurred at the popliteal artery puncture site. The patients were treated conservatively and were discharged as usual. Conclusion(s): Endovascular treatment of long SFA-CTOs via the popliteal approach was effective and safe. Using the GIP method to address long SFA-CTOs is recommended.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
3372,"Effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy on atypical meningioma patients: A population-based study Purpose: It is controversial whether atypical meningioma patients undergoing gross-total resection (GTR) can benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PORT on atypical meningioma patients. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with atypical meningioma from 2008 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and the log-rank test was used to compare the differences among groups. Univariable and multivariable COX regressions were conducted for survival analyses. Result(s): A total of 1,014 patients were enrolled. The 5-years survival rate of the overall patients was 79.0%. PORT was performed in 315 (31.1%) patients. The utilization rates of PORT in patients undergoing GTR and undergoing subtotal resection (STR) were 26.7% and 42.2%, respectively. For patients undergoing STR, log-rank test showed that overall survival (OS) time was significantly longer in patients receiving PORT than those not (p = 0.026). For patients undergoing GTR, OS time did not show significant association with PORT (p = 0.339). In addition, patients undergoing STR with PORT had no significantly different OS time compared with those undergoing GTR with PORT (p = 0.398). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that receipt of PORT (p = 0.187) was not an independent predictor of OS after adjustment. Conclusion(s): PORT may not prolong the OS in atypical meningioma patients undergoing GTR. However, patients undergoing STR may benefit from PORT and achieve similar OS to those undergoing GTR.Copyright © 2019 Zeng, Shi and Guo.",Excluded
2562,"In vivo radiation dosimetry and image quality of turbo-flash and retrospective dual-source CT coronary angiography PURPOSE: To compare measured radiation dose (MD), estimated radiation dose (ED) and image quality in coronary computed tomography between turbo-flash (TFP) and retrospective protocol (RP) and correlate MD with size-specific dose estimates (SSDE)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, we selected 68 patients (mean age, 59.2 +/- 9.7 years) undergoing 192 x 2 dual-source CT (SOMATOM Force, Siemens) to rule out coronary artery disease. Thirty-one underwent TFP and 37 RP. To evaluate in vivo MD, thermoluminescent dosimeters were placed, superficially, at thyroid and heart level, left breast areola and left hemi-thorax. MD in each site, and ED parameters, such as volume CT dose index (CTDIvol), SSDE, dose length product (DLP), effective dose (E), were compared between two protocols with a t test. Image quality was compared between two protocols. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated with a kappa coefficient (k). In each protocol, MD was correlated with SSDE using a Pearson coefficient (r)., RESULTS: Comparing TFP and RP, MD at thyroid (1.43 vs. 2.58 mGy; p = 0.0408), heart (3.58 vs. 28.72 mGy; p < 0.0001), left breast areola (3.00 vs. 24.21 mGy; p < 0.0001) and left hemi-thorax (2.68 vs. 24.03 mGy; p < 0.0001), CTDIvol, SSDE, DLP and E were significantly lower. Differences in image quality were not statistically significant. Inter-observer agreement was good (k = 0.796) in TFP and very good (k = 0.817) in RP. MD and SSDE excellently correlated with TFP (r = 0.9298, p < 0.0001) and RP (r = 0.9753, p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: With TFP, MD, CTDIvol, SSDE, DLP and E were significantly lower, than with RP. Image quality was similar between two protocols. MD correlated excellently with SSDE in each protocol.",Excluded
2919,"Impact of Hybrid Operating Rooms on Long-Term Clinical Outcomes Following Fenestrated and Branched Endovascular Aortic Repair Purpose: Evaluate the impact of hybrid operating room (HOR) guidance on the long-term clinical outcomes following fenestrated and branched endovascular repair (F-BEVAR) for complex aortic aneurysms. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospectively collected registry data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the procedural, short- and long-term outcomes of consecutive F-BEVAR performed from January 2010 to December 2014 under standard mobile C-arm versus hybrid room guidance in a high-volume aortic center. Result(s): A total of 262 consecutive patients, including 133 patients treated with a mobile C-arm equipped operating room and 129 with a HOR guidance, were enrolled in this study. Patient radiation exposure and contrast media volume were significantly reduced in the HOR group. Short-term clinical outcomes were improved despite higher case complexity in the HOR group, with no statistical significance. At a median follow-up of 63.3 months (Q1 33.4, Q3 75.9) in the C-arm group, and 44.9 months (Q1 25.1, Q3 53.5, p=0.53) in the HOR group, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of target vessel occlusion and limb occlusion. When the endograft involved 3 or more fenestrations and/or branches (complex F-BEVAR), graft instability (36% vs 25%, p=0.035), reintervention on target vessels (20% vs 11%, p=0.019) and total reintervention rates (24% vs 15%, p=0.032) were significantly reduced in the HOR group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences for long-term death and aortic-related death between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that better long-term clinical outcomes could be observed when performing complex F-BEVAR in the latest generation HOR.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded
2598,"Determining the burden of tuberculosis in Eritrea: A new approach Objective: To obtain an estimate of the prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in Eritrea using a new low-cost approach. Method(s): The study was designed to include a sample of 35 000 people divided between 40 clusters. The clusters were selected by sampling proportional to population size. In each cluster, census data were obtained from eligible individuals. Individuals aged 15 years or more were questioned about cough and its duration and smoking and were asked to provide two samples of sputum (spot and morning) for examination by fluorescence microscopy. Finding(s): A total of 38 032 individuals were included in the study. Of the 19 197 individuals aged 15 years or more, 18 152 (94.6%) provided at least one sample of sputum. Fifteen individuals fulfilled the case definition, providing a prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis of 90 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, CI, 35-145 per 100 000) individuals aged 15 years or more and 50 per 100 000 (95% CI, 19-80 per 100 000) in the total population. Conclusion(s): The estimated prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis obtained from our study is considerably lower than the estimate published by the World Health Organization. The new methodology for surveys to determine the prevalence of tuberculosis that we used is feasible in the field. This methodology should be validated in other countries and compared with other methods for measuring prevalence.",Excluded
1869,"Safety and Feasibility of Performing Fenestrated Endovascular Abdominal Aneurysm Repair Using a Portable C-arm Without Fusion Technology: A Single-Center Experience Objective Most centers performing fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (F-EVAR) use hybrid rooms with fusion technology for mapping. We present our experience of successfully performing F-EVAR using C-arm without fusion technology. Methods During the period of January 2016 to October 2018, data were collected from a prospectively maintained F-EVAR database at our tertiary care institute. The primary endpoint was technical success, and the secondary outcomes measured were short- and midterm clinical success (both defined by the Society for Vascular Surgery reporting standards), blood loss, radiation dose, operative time, postoperative endoleaks, aneurysm rupture, endograft patency, and complications. Results We performed 11 F-EVARs during the study period in five (45.5%) males and six (54.5%) females, with a mean age of 75+8 years. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using OEC 9900 Elite Mobile C-arm (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) without the use of fusion technology. Three patients had planned preoperative open procedures for access due to prior cutdown or bypass. Technical success was achieved in all 11 (100%) cases. The mean length of stay was 5+2 days, and the mean follow-up was 7.5+6.5 months. The mean procedure time was 301+167 minutes, and the mean blood loss was 361+233 mL. Mean fluoroscopy time was 72+31 minutes, and the mean radiation exposure time was 2,160+930 mGy. No patients required intraoperative transfusion. Thirty-day (short term) clinical success was achieved in 10 (90.0%), cases whereas six-month (midterm) clinical success was achieved in 7 (77.7%) patients. Branch vessel patency was 11 (100%) at 30 days and 9 (81.8%) at six months, and primary endograft patency was 100% (11) at six months. We had no perioperative mortality or major adverse cardiac event at 30 days. Thirty-day postoperative morbidity included readmission for pulmonary edema from cardiac failure in one patient. Two patients had clinically insignificant silent cardiac enzyme elevation. Three patients had re-interventions performed during the mean follow-up period. Two patients developed renal stent thrombosis resulting in renal insufficiency, which is defined as an increase in creatinine concentration >=0.5 mg/dL, without the need for dialysis. One type II endoleak was identified postoperatively that required trans-lumbar embolization. No type I or III endoleaks were identified during the study period. Asymptomatic common femoral artery thrombosis was seen on follow-up imaging in one patient. Conclusions We conclude that F-EVAR can be safely performed using C-arm without the use of fusion technology. Its utility can be expanded to centers with appropriate skill set but no hybrid technology. Copyright © 2020, Juneja et al.",Excluded
25,"The irradiation of Babesia bovis. 1. The difference in pathogenicity between irradiated and non-irradiated populations Babesia bovis parasites attenuated by 35 krads gamma irradiation and parasites not exposed to irradiation, were injected into intact 2-year-old Hereford steers. All five animals receiving non-irradiated blood died but the five animals which received irradiated blood were only mildly affected. Highly significant differences were observed in changes to plasma fibrinogen, serum fibrinogen-like proteins, packed cell volume, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, blood kinins, and plasma kininogen levels in the control animals but non-significant changes in these parameters occurred in the group receiving iradiated blood. Significant changes in the antiplasmin alpha 2M, and the antithrombin levels occurred in control cattle but not in the group receiving irradiated blood. Parasite multiplications rates and maximum parasitaemias were similar in both groups. Irradiation reduced the dose of living parasites from 1 x 10(8) to 2.5 x 10(3), but this was not the reason for the mild reactions. It was concluded that irradiation had selected an avirulent parasite population.",Included
1992,"Dynamic visual acuity during walking after long-duration spacefl ight Introduction: Astronauts experience alterations in gaze control as a result of adaptive changes in eye-head coordination produced by microgravity exposure. This may lead to potential changes in postfl ight visual acuity during head and body motion. Method(s): We gathered dynamic visual acuity (DVA) data from 14 astronauts and cosmonauts after longduration (~6 mo) stays in space. Walking was used to induce self-motion and visual acuity was determined by sequentially presenting Landolt ring optotypes on a computer display placed 4 m in front of subjects. Acuity assessments were made while seated (static condition) and walking (dynamic condition) at 6.4 km . h-1 on a motorized treadmill. In each condition, a psychophysical threshold detection algorithm minimized the required number of optotype presentations by maximizing the amount displayed around the subject's acuity threshold. The difference between static and dynamic acuity measures provided a metric of change in the subjects' ability to maintain gaze fi xation on the visual target while walking. Result(s): A decrement in postfl ight visual acuity during walking was found. A mean dynamic acuity decrement of approximately 0.75 eye-chart lines was observed 1 d after returning from space. The population mean showed a consistent improvement in DVA performance during the fi rst postfl ight week. Discussion(s): The recovery curves for individual subjects did not necessarily follow a pattern of continuous improvement with each passing day. When adjusted for previous long-duration fl ight experience, the population mean showed an unexpected DVA reduction in the re-adaptation curve that is similar to recovery patterns observed in prism adaptation studies.",Excluded
1461,"Real world outcomes of combination and timing of immunotherapy with radiotherapy for melanoma with brain metastases Introduction: Immunotherapy (IT) and radiotherapy (RT) have improved overall survival in patients with melanoma with brain metastasis (MBM). We examined the real-world survival impact of IT and RT combination and timing strategies. Material(s) and Method(s): From the facility-based National Cancer Database (NCDB) data set, 3008 cases of MBM were identified between 2011 and 2015. Six treatment cohorts were identified: stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) + IT, SRS alone, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) + IT, WBRT alone, IT alone, and none. Concurrent therapy was defined as IT given within 28 days before or after RT; nonconcurrent defined as IT administered within 28-90 days of RT. The co-primary outcomes were propensity score-adjusted overall survival by treatment regimen and overall survival by RT and IT timing. Result(s): Median overall survival (mOS) was performed for each treatment category; SRS +IT 15.77 m; (95%CI 12.13-21.29), SRS alone (9.33 m; 95%CI: 8.0-11.3), IT alone (7.29 m; 95%CI: 5.35-12.91), WBRT +IT (4.89 m; 95%CI: 3.65-5.92), No RT or IT (3.29 m; 95%CI: 2.96-3.75), and WBRT alone (3.12 m; 95%CI 2.79-3.52). By propensity score matching, mOS for SRS +IT (15.5 m; 95%CI: 11.5-20.2) was greater than SRS alone (10.1 m; 95%CI: 8.4-11.8) (p = 0.010), and median survival for WBRT +IT (4.6 m; 95%CI: 3.4-5.6) was greater than WBRT alone (2.9 m; 95%CI: 2.5-3.5) (p < 0.001). In the SRS +IT group, 24-month landmark survival was 47% (95%CI; 42-52) for concurrent versus 37% (95%CI; 30-44) for nonconcurrent (p = 0.40). Conclusion(s): Those who received IT in addition to WBRT and SRS experienced longer survival compared to RT modalities alone, while those receiving concurrent SRS and IT trended toward improved survival versus nonconcurrent therapy.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

2583,"Impact of fapi-pet/ct on target volume definition in radiation therapy of locally recurrent pancreatic cancer (1) Background: A new radioactive positron emission tomography (PET) tracer uses in-hibitors of fibroblast activation protein (FAPI) to visualize FAP-expressing cancer associated fibro-blasts. Significant FAPI-uptake has recently been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer patients. Target volume delineation for radiation therapy still relies on often less precise conventional computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially in locally recurrent pancreatic cancer patients. The need for improvement in precise tumor detection and delineation led us to innovatively use the novel FAPI-PET/CT for radiation treatment planning. (2) Methods: Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) of seven locally recurrent pancreatic cancer cases were contoured by six radiation oncologists. In addition, FAPI-PET/CT was used to automatically delineate tumors. The interobserver variability in target definition was analyzed and FAPI-based automatic GTVs were compared to the manually defined GTVs. (3) Results: Target definition differed significantly between different radiation oncologists with mean dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) between 0.55 and 0.65. There was no significant dif-ference between the volumes of automatic FAPI-GTVs based on the threshold of 2.0 and most of the manually contoured GTVs by radiation oncologists. (4) Conclusion(s): Due to its high tumor to background contrast, FAPI-PET/CT seems to be a superior imaging modality compared to the current gold standard contrast-enhanced CT in pancreatic cancer. For the first time, we demonstrate how FAPI-PET/CT could facilitate target definition and increases consistency in radiation oncology in pancreatic cancer.Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

1251,"The early causal influence of cell size upon synaptic number: the mutant gigas of Drosophila The number of synaptic contacts formed by a neuron is known to vary with its surface area. This could be because large neurons are able to establish more synaptic sites, or because those neurons that are able to establish more sites are subsequently able to enlarge. To test between these two possibilities clones of enlarged ommatidia were generated in the retina of the Drosophila mutant gigas, by mitotic recombination following gamma-irradiation in the third-instar larva. The numbers of afferent synaptic contacts formed by the photoreceptor terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, were then counted in the adult. The terminals of mutant photoreceptors were also enlarged, but by varying degrees. The sizes of their profiles in single sections merged with the size distribution of terminals having a wild-type phenotype, lying outside the clone in the same lamina. A perimeter of 6.0 microns for the profiles of receptor terminal in cross section was established as a criterion for distinguishing between normal and mutant phenotypes. The mutant terminals had more presynaptic sites. Because only the gigas terminals are mutant and because they enlarged at a time long before synapse formation occurred in the lamina we may conclude that cell enlargement preceded elevated synaptic number. The increase in synaptic number roughly matched the increased membrane surface of the terminals, so as nearly to preserve a constant areal density of synaptic sites over a 5-fold range in synaptic frequency.",Excluded
315,"High-pitch versus sequential mode for coronary calcium in individuals with a high heart rate: Potential for dose reduction BACKGROUND: To determine the impact of high-pitch spiral acquisition on radiation dose and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification by coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment with computed tomography in individuals with a high heart rate., METHODS: Of the ROBINSCA trial, 1990 participants with regular rhythm and heart rates >65 beats per minute (bpm) were included. As reference, 390 participants with regular heart rates <=65 bpm were used. All participants underwent prospectively electrocardiographically(ECG)-triggered imaging of the coronary arteries using dual source CT at 120kVp, 80 ref mAs using both high-pitch spiral mode and sequential mode. Radiation dose, Agatston score, number of positive scores, as well as median absolute difference of the Agatston score were determined and participants were stratified into CVD risk categories., RESULTS: A similar percentage of participants with low heart rates and high heart rates had a positive CAC score in data sets acquired in high-pitch spiral (low heart rate: 57.7%, high heart rate: 55.8%) and sequential mode (58.0%, 54.7%, p=n.s.). The median absolute difference in Agatston scores between acquisition modes was 14.2% and 9.2%, for the high and low heart rate groups, respectively. Excellent agreement for risk categorization between the two data acquisition modes was found for the high (kappa=0.927) and low (kappa=0.946) heart rate groups. Radiation dose was 48% lower for high-pitch spiral versus sequential acquisitions., CONCLUSION: Radiation dose for the quantification of coronary calcium can be reduced by 48% when using the high-pitch spiral acquisition mode compared to the sequential mode in participants with a regular high heart rate. CVD risk stratification agreement between the two modes of data acquisition is excellent. Copyright © 2018 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography. Published by Elsevier Inc.

1122,"Hyperfractionated radiotherapy for T2N0 glottic carcinoma: A retrospective analysis at 10 years follow-up in a series of 60 consecutive patients Aims and background: To report results of hyperfractionated radiotherapy for T2N0 glottic carcinoma at a single institution after extended follow-up. Method(s): Between 1980 and 1988 at Varese University Hospital, 60 consecutive patients with T2N0 glottic carcinoma received exclusive radiotherapy consisting of 1.5 Gy/fraction twice a day. Treatment gaps during the radiotherapy course were allowed according to individual tolerance. This policy resulted in a wide range of elapsed treatment time: median, 5.7 weeks; range, 3.7-8.9. Median follow-up is 9.8 years. Result(s): As a result of dose/time distribution, 16, 20 and 24 patients received an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week or >10 Gy/week, respectively. Mean total dose for each group was 62.8 Gy, 63.7 Gy and 63.8 Gy, respectively. Five-year local-regional control was 69 +/- 6% (95% CI); ultimate local-regional control, including salvage surgery, was 78 +/- 5%. All failures were at the primary site, and no patient developed neck recurrence as first site of failure. The actuarial incidence of grade 2-3 late reactions at 5 years was 42 +/- 6%. Most late toxicity events were grade 2: only 2 patients developed grade 3 reactions and none grade 4. None of the several clinical and treatment-related variables showed any statistically significant impact on local-regional control or late toxicity at univariate and multivariate analysis. In particular, 3-year local-regional control rates were 73 +/- 11%, 84 +/- 8% and 69 +/- 10% for an average weekly dose rate of <10 Gy/week, equal to 10 Gy/week and >10 Gy/week, respectively (not significantly different). Conclusion(s): At a very long follow-up, the hyperfractionated regimen tested in the study was shown to be effective and devoid of major complications, provided individual patient acute tolerance is carefully taken into account.

2430,"Novel mutation in keratin 10 causing autosomal dominant epidermolytic ichthyosis Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI; OMIM 113800), previously termed bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma or epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of keratinization caused by mutations in either of the KRT1 or KRT10 genes, which encode the suprabasal keratins K1 and K10, respectively. The condition is usually characterized clinically by severe neonatal erythroderma, blistering and fragile skin, with the subsequent development of generalized hyperkeratosis. Usually mutations are missense substitutions in the highly conserved alpha-helical rod domains of these keratins, which play a critical role in filament formation. The presence of palmoplantar keratoderma is suggestive of KRT1 mutations, whereas KRT10 mutations are associated with palmoplantar sparing. We report a seven-generation kindred with EI due to a novel mutation in KRT10. A 32-year-old woman presented with widespread ichthyosis and erythema affecting her trunk and limbs. She gave a history of scaling and erythroderma since birth but no blistering, erosions or collodion membrane. She had been maintained on oral isotretinoin 20-40 mg once daily from the age of 13 years, but had recently developed lower-back and hip pain. Examination revealed widespread fine scaling and erythema over the trunk and limbs with more significant hyperkeratosis at the elbows, knees and ankles. There was relative sparing of the palmoplantar skin. Her father, uncle and grandmother were more severely affected, but none was receiving oral retinoids. Four further generations were recorded as affected. Histology of affected elbow and upper-arm skin demonstrated acanthosis, marked overlying hyperkeratosis, vacuolar change of the upper epidermal cells in the upper epidermis with prominent clumping of keratohyaline granules and abnormal eosinophilic cytoplasm. X-rays of the lower lumbar spine and left hip demonstrated bridging osteophytes T11-L1 and flattening of the left femoral head, with magnetic resonance imaging confirming the presence of avascular necrosis. This required treatment with a left core decompression of the left hip, with good results. Mutation screening of KRT10 identified a novel heterozygous deletion extending from intron 5 into exon 6 (designated K10 c.1156-79- 1243del), abolishing the exon 6 acceptor splice site, resulting in a shorter aberrant K10 protein lacking a sequence motif critically important for keratin filament assembly. The mutation was present in her affected father. This finding adds to the evidence that K10 mutations are the principal cause of autosomal dominant EI with palmoplantar sparing. It also highlights the possible side-effects of long-term oral retinoid treatment in these inherited conditions.",Excluded

3078,"The Price of Tumor Control: An Analysis of Rare Side Effects of Anti-CTLA-4 Therapy in Metastatic Melanoma from the Ipilimumab Network Background: Ipilimumab, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) blocking antibody, has been approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma and induces adverse events (AE) in up to 64% of patients. Treatment algorithms for the management of common ipilimumab-induced AEs have lead to a reduction of morbidity, e.g. due to bowel perforations. However, the spectrum of less common AEs is expanding as ipilimumab is increasingly applied. Stringent recognition and management of AEs will reduce drug-induced morbidity and costs, and thus, positively impact the cost-benefit ratio of the drug. To facilitate timely identification and adequate management data on rare AEs were analyzed at 19 skin cancer centers. Methods and Findings: Patient files (n = 752) were screened for rare ipilimumab-associated AEs. A total of 120 AEs, some of which were life-threatening or even fatal, were reported and summarized by organ system describing the most instructive cases in detail. Previously unreported AEs like drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), granulomatous inflammation of the central nervous system, and aseptic meningitis, were documented. Obstacles included patients delay in reporting symptoms and the differentiation of steroid-induced from ipilimumab-induced AEs under steroid treatment. Importantly, response rate was high in this patient population with tumor regression in 30.9% and a tumor control rate of 61.8% in stage IV melanoma patients despite the fact that some patients received only two of four recommended ipilimumab infusions. This suggests that ipilimumab-induced antitumor responses can have an early onset and that severe autoimmune reactions may reflect overtreatment. Conclusion(s): The wide spectrum of ipilimumab-induced AEs demands doctor and patient awareness to reduce morbidity and treatment costs and true ipilimumab success is dictated by both objective tumor responses and controlling severe side effects. © 2013 Voskens et al.",Excluded
2418,"A Serum Small Molecule Biosignature of Radiation Exposure from Total Body Irradiated Patients The potential for radiological accidents and nuclear terrorism has increased the need for the development of new rapid biodosimetry methods. In addition, in a clinical setting the issue of an individual's radiosensitivity should be taken into consideration during radiotherapy. We utilized metabolomics and lipidomics to investigate changes of metabolites in serum samples following exposure to total body ionizing radiation in humans. Serum was collected prior to irradiation, at 3-8 h after a single dose of 1.25-2 Gy, and at 24 h with a total delivered dose of 2-3.75 Gy. Metabolomics revealed perturbations in glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, ubiquinone Q2, and oxalic acid. Alterations were observed in circulating levels of lipids from monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol lipid classes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were some of the most dysregulated lipids, with increased levels linked to proinflammatory processes. A targeted metabolomics approach for eicosanoids was also employed. The results showed a rapid response for proinflammatory eicosanoids, with a dampening of the signal at the later time point. Sex differences were observed in the markers from the untargeted approach but not the targeted method. The ability to identify and quantify small molecules in blood can therefore be utilized to monitor radiation exposure in human populations.",Included
1086,"Induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemo-radiation in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma - A single institution experience Background: Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) is the commonest Head & Neck cancer in Saudi Arabia. Concomitant Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin followed by 3 cycles of adjuvant Cisplatin based chemotherapy is the standard of care in patients with locally advanced disease (LANPC). However, the compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy has been unsatisfactory. Material(s) and Method(s): Between August 2002 and July 2010, fifty-four patients (37 males: 17 females) with locally advanced (AJCC Stage III & IV), non-metastatic NPC were treated using Induction Chemotherapy (IC) with Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) for 3 cycles, followed by Concomitant chemo-radiation using weekly Carboplatin with conventionally fractionated 3-D conformal radiotherapy to a total dose of 65-70 Gy. Result(s): Median age was 42 year (15 to 72). Twenty-six patients (48%) had stage IV disease, and 17 (31%) had T4 tumours. Undifferentiated Carcinoma Nasopharyngeal Type accounted for 96% of the cases. Fortysix patients had more than 12 months follow-up (median 42) and are the subject of the following analysis. Two patients died during induction chemotherapy. Of the remaining 44 patients, IC resulted in 25% Complete Clinical Remission, and 72% Partial Remission, an overall Response Rate of 97%. Hematological toxicity was frequent, but manageable. In total, there were 2 local and 2 distant relapses, 2 of them appearing beyond 3-years of follow-up. Two patients died of progressive disease, one is alive with disease, and one local relapse was successfully salvaged with further radiotherapy. For the entire series (46 patients) the 4-year Kaplan-Meier Overall Survival (OS) rate is 88%. For the 44 patients who completed the protocol, the 4-year Disease Free Survival (DFS) rate is 84%. All 8 patients under 23 year of age remain disease-free at more than 6 years median follow-up. One patient developed a suspected grade 3 neurologic toxicity, and another had a cerebral-vascular accident one year following salvage local re-irradiation. Conclusion(s): Sequential therapy as used in this group of patients seems well tolerated and yields high remission rate and an encouraging DFS and OS in patients with LANPC. Future development should focus on better risk stratification, and systematic use of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapylike techniques. Young adults with LANPC may need a different treatment approach that would include IC followed by response-adjusted chemoradiotherapy.",Excluded
909,"Effects of whole-body UVB irradiation on cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from stage I melanoma patients Ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes significant impairment of immunological function in human skin. The immunosuppressive effects of UV radiation are thought to be due to local release of cytokines by human keratinocytes, leading to impaired function of epidermal antigen-presenting cells (APC) and failure to induce cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recent studies have shown that individuals susceptible to UV-induced suppression of DTH may be more prone to develop skin cancer including malignant melanoma (MM). Since the causal relationship between UV radiation and the induction of MM still seems obscure, we investigated the immunological reactions of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to whole-body irradiation with UVB in 15 stage I melanoma patients as compared to PBMC from normal volunteers matched for age, gender and skin type. Whole-body irradiation was performed with 0.8 minimal erythema dosages on five consecutive days. Peripheral blood was obtained before and after the procedure. Overall, there were no major effects of UVB irradiation on peripheral lymphocyte subsets and proliferation of PBMC from patients or normal controls, but UVB irradiation led to a significant increase in PWM-stimulated production of IL-6, IL-2R and TNF by PBMC. These changes were independent of the individual UVB dosages administered and appeared in both groups similarly. UVB irradiation did not lead to significant changes on IL-1 and IL-2 expression by PBMC.

All plans were done in Monaco planning system for Elekta Synergy linear accelerator with 80 multileaf collimator (MLC). Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans were done with different increment of gantry angle like 15 o , 20 o , 30 o and 40 o. The remaining parameters were similar for all the plans. The results were compared. To compare the plan quality with number of arcs, VMAT plans were done with single and dual arc with increment of gantry angle of 20 o. The dose to gross tumor volume (GTV) for 60 Gy and planning target volume (PTV) for 48 Gy was compared. The dosimetric parameters D 98% , D 95% , D 50% and D max of GTV were analyzed. The homogeneity index (HI) and conformity index (CI) of GTV were studied and the dose to 98% and 95% of PTV was analyzed. Maximum dose to spinal cord and planning risk volume of cord (PRV cord) was compared. The Volume of lung receiving 10 Gy, 20 Gy and mean dose was analyzed. The volume of heart receiving 30 Gy and 45 Gy was compared. The volume of normal tissue receiving greater than 2 Gy and 5 Gy was compared. The number of monitor units (MU) required to deliver the plans were compared. The plan with larger increment of gantry angle proved to be superior to smaller increment of gantry angle plans in terms of dose coverage, HI, CI and normal tissue sparing. The number of arcs did not make any difference in the quality of the plan.",Excluded
663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
678,"An open-label, prospective pilot clinical study of denosumab for severe hyperparathyroidism in patients with low bone mass undergoing dialysis CONTEXT: Denosumab is widely used for bone diseases with increased bone resorption. Its effectiveness in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism on dialysis is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab in patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism who are on dialysis.
DESIGN: This 6-month prospective, open-labeled study evaluated 12 patients (five women, seven men; mean age 53.5 ± 3.8 y). All had intact PTH (iPTH; > 1000 pg/mL), low bone mass (T-score < -1.0 SD), and bone pain and were poor surgical candidates. Serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (AP), and iPTH levels were assessed at baseline and every month thereafter. Vertebral spine x-rays and bone mineral densities (BMDs) (lumbar spine and femoral neck) were assessed at the start and end of the study. All patients received denosumab (60 mg), calcitriol, phosphate binders, and dialysate calcium that were adjusted according to the biochemistry data.
RESULTS: The BMD increased in both the femoral neck (mean increase 23.7% ± 4.0%) and lumbar spine (17.1% ± 2.6%) after 6 months. In the first month, most patients had increased iPTH levels, which dramatically decreased from 1702.1 ± 181.9 to 518.8 ± 126.8 pg/mL by the end of the study after increasing the calcitriol dose. All patients had significant decreases in AP, calcium × phosphorus, and bone pain. Changes in femoral neck BMD correlated only with AP and iPTH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is effective in restoring bone mass and reducing bone pain in patients on dialysis with secondary hyperparathyroidism. It also allows for a more aggressive use of calcitriol to control hyperparathyroidism.",Excluded
3117,"Effects of Far-Infrared Therapy on Foot Circulation Among Hemodialysis Patients With Diabetes Mellitus BACKGROUND: Far-infrared radiation (FIR) therapy improves vessel dilation, circulation, vessel endothelial function, and angiogenesis and reduces atherosclerosis. However, evidence of FIR therapy's effects on foot circulation among diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis is scarce., AIM: To determine whether FIR therapy improves foot circulation in diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis., DESIGN: Quasi-experimental., METHODS: In June to November 2017, diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis (N = 58) at a hemodialysis center in northern Taiwan were divided into two groups: the experimental group (n = 31) received FIR therapy to the bilateral dorsalis pedis artery (40 min/session, 3 times/week for 6 months) and the control group (n = 27) received conventional dialysis care. Paired t test, independent samples t test, two-proportion Z test, and repeated-measures analysis of covariance were performed to compare changes from baseline to the end of the 6-month intervention between the groups., RESULTS: Significant positive effects of FIR therapy on temperature, pulse, and blood flow of the dorsalis pedis artery were observed. Sensitivity to pain, tactility, and pressure also improved significantly in the experimental group. The Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire revealed that the experimental group had reductions in subjective experiences of soreness, tingling, and coldness in the feet., CONCLUSION: The findings of significant improvements to objective and subjective measures of blood flow and neural function in the experimental group indicate that FIR therapy improves blood circulation to the feet. This therapy thus has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment for patients with diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis.",Excluded
585,"Delineating chromosomal breakpoints in radiation-induced papillary thyroid cancer Recurrent translocations are well known hallmarks of many human solid tumors and hematological disorders, where patient- and breakpoint-specific information may facilitate prognostication and individualized therapy. In thyroid carcinomas, the proto-oncogenes RET and NTRK1 are often found to be activated through chromosomal rearrangements. However, many sporadic tumors and papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) arising in patients with a history of exposure to elevated levels of ionizing irradiation do not carry these known abnormalities. We developed a rapid scheme to screen tumor cell metaphase spreads and identify candidate genes of tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression for subsequent functional studies. Using a series of overnight fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments with pools comprised of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, it now becomes possible to rapidly refine breakpoint maps and, within one week, progress from the low resolution Spectral Karyotyping (SKY) maps or Giemsa-banding (G-banding) karyotypes to fully integrated, high resolution physical maps including a list of candiate genes in the critical regions. © 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Excluded
2559,"The secondary sex ratio in Italy over the past eighty years (1940 to 2019) and potential impact of radiological contamination after atmospheric nuclear testing and after Chernobyl: Temporal change-point analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo In Europe, the male to female ratio at birth (secondary sex ratio: SSR; sex odds: SO) is 1.04-1.06, is influenced by many factors and is declining in industrialized countries. This study was carried out to identify possible impacts of fallout by atomic bomb tests or by the Chernobyl event on SSR in Italy. Italy is a country without commercial nuclear power generation for the last four decades and thus nearly free of radiological confounders. Counts of annual male and female live births in Italy are provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT). This study included 57.7 million live births (1940-2019) with overall SSR 1.05829. The Italian SSR trend was modelled with linear and non-linear logistic regression. Trend changes, i.e., periods with level shifts were estimated with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Two distinct idealized level shifts were identified superimposed on a uniform secular downward trend. The first one is seen towards the end of the 1960s with a jump sex odds ratio (SOR) 1.00681, p < 0.0001. The second one occurred in 1987 with SOR 1.00474, p < 0.0001. In each of the 3 periods separated by the two jumps, SSR uniformly decreased with trend SOR per 100 years of 0.98549, p < 0.0001. In conclusion, the secular trend in the Italian SSR showed two marked level shifts, at the end of the 1960s and from 1987 onward. These follow the release of radioactivity by atmospheric atomic bomb tests during the 1960s and by Chernobyl in 1986 and corroborate the hypothesis that ionizing radiation increases SSR.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
1659,"New effective dose estimates for Rubidium-82 based on dynamic PET/CT imaging in humans Objectives Published radiation dose estimates for Rubidium-82 vary widely, and no comprehensive study in man has yet been conducted. With the increasing use of Rb-82 PET for myocardial perfusion imaging, improved dosimetry information is needed for accurate risk assessment. The purpose of this study was to measure Rb-82 internal organ and effective doses with PET/CT in humans. Methods We recruited 26 cardiac patients and 4 normal subjects with no cardiac history. Dynamic 3D PET scans were acquired (GE Discovery RX/VCT) over 10 minutes following IV injection of 10 MBq/kg Rb-82. Images were reconstructed using FORE-OSEM and 8 mm Hann filter. Cardiac scans of the chest were acquired at rest for all 30 subjects, plus one additional scan of the Head, Neck, Abdomen, Pelvis, or Thighs. Mean Rb-82 residence times were determined in 22 source organs using volumes-of-interest (VOI) drawn on the fused PET/CT images. For large organs a small VOI was used to avoid partial volume losses. For small organs the average activity above 80% threshold was multiplied by the volume at 40% of the peak value within the organ VOI. Target organ doses and the effective dose estimate were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 according to ICRP 60, and recalculated according to ICRP 103. Results A total of 283 organs were measured across the 60 scans, with at least 4 samples obtained in each source organ. The average 'adult' effective dose for Rubidium-82 was found to be 0.00074 mSv/MBq using ICRP 60. Using ICRP 103, the male and female effective doses were 0.00074 and 0.00092 mSv/MBq respectively. The highest absorbed organ dose was to the kidneys. Conclusions These dose estimates for Rubidium-82 are the first to be measured directly with PET/CT in humans, and are 4 to 4.5 times lower than previous ICRP 60 values based on a theoretical blood flow model. The new values derived from human studies suggest a typical effective dose of 0.6 mSv per scan with 3D PET.",Excluded

3296,"The biomechanical effects of 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation on human bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts Recent data suggest that anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with irradiated allograft tissue may lead to increased failure rates. Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation does not significantly alter the preimplantation biomechanical properties of bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts. Controlled laboratory study. Cyclic and failure mechanical properties were evaluated for 20 paired central-third human BTB allografts, with and without 1.0 to 1.2 Mrad of gamma irradiation. Testing included cyclic loading at 0.5 Hz for 100 cycles from 50 to 200 N and failure testing at a strain rate of 10% per second. Cyclic elongation did not change significantly (P = .151) with irradiation, increasing from a mean +/- SD of 9.4 +/- 2.1 mm to 11.3 +/- 3.4 mm. Cyclic creep strain approached a significant increase with irradiation (1.3% +/- 0.8% to 2.6% +/- 1.5%; P = .076). Failure testing was not affected with irradiation with regard to maximum load (1680 +/- 417 mm to 1494 +/- 435 mm), maximum stress (40.8 +/- 10.6 MPa to 37.5 +/- 15.7 MPa), elongation (7.85 +/- 1.35 mm to 8.67 +/- 2.05 mm), or strain at maximum stress (0.158 +/- 0.03 to 0.175 +/- 0.03). Graft stiffness significantly decreased by 20% with irradiation (278 +/- 67 N/mm to 221 +/- 50 N/mm; P = .035). Low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation decreases BTB graft stiffness by 20%, but it does not affect other failure or cyclic parameters. Aside from graft stiffness during load to failure testing, low-dose (1.0-1.2 Mrad) gamma irradiation of central-third human BTB allografts is not deleterious to preimplantation biomechanical properties.",Included
1317,"Abbreviated course of radiation therapy in elderly patients with glioblastoma: Clinical outcome (Mansoura university) Background:Most patients with glioblastoma are older than 60 years, but treatment guidelines are based on trials in patients aged only up to 70 years. We did this trial to assess the impact of short schedule radiotherapy in patients aged 60 years and older with glioblastoma. Patients & Methods: Fifty patients aged 60 years or older with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) greater than or equal to 70 were treated with postoperative hypofractionated radiotherapy (34Gy administered in 3.4Gy fractions over 2 weeks). The primary endpoint of the study was overall survival. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, and tolerance to treatment. Result(s): The median age at surgery was 71 years (range 60-81). No patient received prior or concomitant chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 12.5 months, the median progressionfree survival and overall survival were 5.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-7.9) and 10 months (95% CI, 8.9-11.1) respectively. Type of surgery (total resection vs. subtotal vs. biopsy) remained a prognostic factor (p=0.034). Tolerance appeared acceptable in terms of KPS changes and corticosteroid use during radiation therapy.

1140,"Clinical and Spectrophotometric Evaluation of Skin Photoadaptation in Vitiligo Patients after a Short Cycle of NB-UVB Phototherapy BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of photoadaptation to narrow-band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) radiation has been previously described in vitiligo and has usually been clinically measured by the assessment of the minimal erythema dose (MED) after phototesting., OBJECTIVES: To assess the photoadaptive response in vitiligo and healthy skin after NB-UVB phototherapy not only clinically, but also by spectrophotometry., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients affected by generalized vitiligo underwent NB-UVB phototherapy twice weekly for 12 weeks. Before and after phototherapy, a phototesting procedure was administered on vitiligo patches and adjacent healthy skin with a solar simulated radiation (SSR). Visual assessment of the MED took place after 24 h. A spectrophotometer was used to assess the a* value and the melanin index (MI*), as signs of skin erythema and pigmentation. The photoadaptation factor (MED-PF) and the a* photoadaptation factor (a*-PF) were calculated., RESULTS: After NB-UVB phototherapy, both vitiligo and healthy skin showed an increase in MED and MI* values and a reduction of skin erythema compared to baseline (p < 0.05). MED-PF data showed a photoadaptation in 10 (71.4%) vitiligo lesions and in 12 (85.7%) healthy skin areas. The assessment of the a*-PF showed a negative mean percentage value in all affected and unaffected skin areas., CONCLUSIONS: A short cycle of NB-UVB phototherapy can induce photoadaptation in vitiligo by increasing the MED and reducing skin erythema after stimulation with SSR. This is most likely due to the physical filter function induced by ultraviolet radiation. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
1146,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included

Their notes and X-rays were reviewed.Goals of treatment were eradication of infection by aggressive debridement of infected tissues, obtaining adequate soft-tissue coverage, preservation/restoration of bonelength, and finally consolidation of the arthrodesis.Thirteen men and six women were treated, with a median age of 46 (17-69) years. Arthrodesis took place after a median of 6 months (0.5-40) post-accident, and after one to six earlier operative procedures. Primarily there had been four bimalleolar, five trimalleolar and ten pilon tibial fractures. Fifteen fractures were open with severe soft tissue damage.Seven free muscle transfers were performed, and ten cancellous bone graftings. Finally 29 attempts at arthrodesis were performed. Ultimately we had to perform two amputations. After a mean follow up of 3.5 years, one patient has an aseptic but asymptomatic pseudarthrosis, for which no further surgery is scheduled. Sixteen extremities are free from infection while full weightbearing is possible.The limb-threatening problem of deep infection after osteosynthesis of an ankle fracture can be resolved by consistent but prolonged treatment.

Objective(s): To study the effects of ALA dose, incubation time, and lesion type on protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production and treatment outcomes. Method(s): To examine the time course of PpIX production, 10% ALA was applied to inflammatory papules for 1 to 5 hours and followed by in situ fluorescence examination. To determine the effects of ALA dose and lesion type, 3, 5, and 10% ALA was applied to acne lesions in split-face fashion for 3 hours followed by whole-face light irradiation at 633 nm and 30 to 70 J/cm2. Treatment was repeated twice at 2-week intervals. Result(s): PpIX reached a stable level after 3 hours of incubation. Similar PpIX levels were seen in areas receiving 3, 5, and 10% ALA. Poisson regression analyses indicated that lesion counts decreased by 0.791 times for a one-unit increase in treatment times (95% CI 0.782-0.799, p < .0001) but only by 0.999 times for a one-unit increase in ALA dose (95% CI 0.998-1.000, p = .22).

The mean biologically equivalent dose (BED10Gy) was 151 Gy (72-180 Gy). Median prescribed dose for peripheral and central lesions was 3x20 Gy and 3x15 Gy, respectively. Local control (LC), overall survival (OS), and cause-specific survival (CSS) rates, early and late toxicities are reported. Statistical analysis was performed to identify factors influencing local tumor control. Median follow-up time was 21 months. In univariate analysis, higher dose was associated with better LC and a cut-off value was detected at BED10Gy <= 112.5 Gy, resulting in 1-, 2-, and 3-year actuarial LC rates of 93%, vs 73%, 80% vs 61%, and 63% vs 54%, for the high and low dose groups, respectively (p = 0.0061, HR = 0.384).

Methods Between January 2007 and August 2010, a cohort of consecutive EO patients who underwent coronary angiography was identified in our center's registry of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention procedures. Of 21,103 procedures, 564 (2.7%) were performed in unique EO patients: 203 (36%) via the transradial approach; and 361 (64%) via the transfemoral approach.Results The primary outcome, a combined endpoint of major bleeding, access site complications, and nonaccess site complications, occurred in 7.5% of the transfemoral group and 2.0% of the transradial group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.10 to 0.88, p = 0.029), an endpoint driven by reductions in major bleeding (3.3% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0 to 0.71, p = 0.015), as well as access site injuries (4.7% vs. 0.0%, OR: 0.08, 95% CI: 0 to 0.48, p = 0.002).

The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic capability of hepatic dynamic CT with low-dose contrast material (420 mg I/kg body weight) at 80 kVp with that of the same modality performed with standard-dose contrast material at 120 kVp. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We randomly assigned 111 patients (50 women, 61 men; mean age, 69.1 years) with known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma and a body weight of 70 kg or less to one of two protocols. In the 80-kVp protocol, the contrast material (444 mg I/kg body weight) was delivered over 15 seconds at a tube voltage of 80 kVp. In the 120-kVp protocol, a contrast dose of 600 mg I/kg was delivered over 30 seconds at 120 kVp. Of the 111 patients, 38 had hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we compared the two protocols for the contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors (difference between tumor attenuation and liver attenuation divided by noise in the liver) and the figure of merit (square of contrast-to-noise ratio divided by effective dose) of the tumors during the arterial phase of imaging. Effective doses also were compared. RESULTS. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (median, 5.3 vs 4.2; p = 0.04). The figure of merit also was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (10.2 vs 5.3, p = 0.02). The effective dose was significantly lower with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (2.97 vs 3.41 mSv, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. With 80-kVp acquisition, the contrast-to-noise ratio and figure of merit of tumors during the arterial phase improved despite the lower contrast dose and radiation exposure. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded

The aim of this study is to summarize the factors related to survival of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. Method(s): A total of 111 NSCLC patients with brain metastases (from September 1995-May 2004) were defined as symptomatic group (37 patients) and asymptomatic group (74 patients) according to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The patients in the symptomatic group were given whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT, DT 30-40 Gy/20 f) first, and then received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The patients in the asymptomatic group were given cisplatin-based chemotherapy first, and then received WBRT. During the treatment, 49 patients received chemotherapy of BCNU or VM-26 irregularly. Result(s): The median survival time was 11 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rate was 40.79% and 13.26% respectively. The survival time was not significantly different between the symptomatic group and asymptomatic group. Median chemotherapy of asymptomatic group was 3 cycles (1-6 cycles) before WBRT. Those patients who received 3 or 4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT had better survival (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0035).

The hematologic toxicity of grade III or IV was not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). The number of brain metastasis (P = 0.000), extracranial metastasis (P = 0.022) and WHO performance status (P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): The patients with asymptomatic brain metastases receive 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT may be reasonable. During the therapy, the patients with administration of BCNU or VM-26 may have survival benefit.",Excluded
558,"The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment and the space endurance record-breaking mice The Italian Space Agency, in line with its scientific strategies and the National Utilization Plan for the International Space Station (ISS), contracted Thales Alenia Space Italia to design and build a spaceflight payload for rodent research on ISS: the Mice Drawer System (MDS). The payload, to be integrated inside the Space Shuttle middeck during transportation and inside the Express Rack in the ISS during experiment execution, was designed to function autonomously for more than 3 months and to involve crew only for maintenance activities. In its first mission, three wild type (Wt) and three transgenic male mice over-expressing pleiotrophin under the control of a bone-specific promoter (PTN-Tg) were housed in the MDS. At the time of launch, animals were 2-months old. MDS reached the ISS on board of Shuttle Discovery Flight 17A/STS-128 on August 28(th), 2009. MDS returned to Earth on November 27(th), 2009 with Shuttle Atlantis Flight ULF3/STS-129 after 91 days, performing the longest permanence of mice in space. Unfortunately, during the MDS mission, one PTN-Tg and two Wt mice died due to health status or payload-related reasons. The remaining mice showed a normal behavior throughout the experiment and appeared in excellent health conditions at landing. During the experiment, the mice health conditions and their water and food consumption were daily checked. Upon landing mice were sacrificed, blood parameters measured and tissues dissected for subsequent analysis. To obtain as much information as possible on microgravity-induced tissue modifications, we organized a Tissue Sharing Program: 20 research groups from 6 countries participated. In order to distinguish between possible effects of the MDS housing conditions and effects due to the near-zero gravity environment, a ground replica of the flight experiment was performed at the University of Genova. Control tissues were collected also from mice maintained on Earth in standard vivarium cages.",Excluded
1557,"Preliminary results of proton beam therapy combined with weekly cisplatin intra-arterial infusion via a superficial temporal artery for treatment of maxillary sinus carcinoma Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of proton beam therapy combined with cisplatin intra-arterial infusion via a superficial temporal artery as treatment for maxillary sinus carcinoma. Method(s): Twenty-six patients with confirmed maxillary sinus carcinoma were enrolled in this study from May 2009 to April 2011. Patients underwent proton beam therapy and intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy with cisplatin. Result(s): The median total dose was 70.4 GyE per 32 fractions, and the median dose of cisplatin was 300 mg/body for six cycles of intra-arterial infusion. The 3-year overall survival rate was 58% for all patients (n = 26), 58% for patients with stage T4 disease (n = 12), 57% for patients with <Stage T3 disease (n = 14), 66% for patients with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 15) and 45% for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11). Two patients developed non-hematologic side effects such as Grade 3 radiation dermatitis, one developed osteonecrosis and one developed brain necrosis. Ocular/visual problems occurred in three patients, which included Grade 4 retinopathy and Grade 3 cataract in one and two patients, respectively. Conclusion(s): Proton beam therapy combined with cisplatin intra-arterial infusion administered via a superficial temporal artery appears to be safe and effective for maxillary sinus carcinoma.Copyright © The Author 2015.

1023,"Trends in radiation dose and technique for anal canal squamous cell carcinoma Background: Anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is managed definitively with chemo and XRT, reserving surgery for salvage. Many different radiation dose schemes have been used, varying from 30 Gy to doses exceeding 60 Gy. RTOG 0529 established IMRT as a standard of care for anal canal SCC, using doses of 50.4-54 Gy. We used the National Cancer Database(NCDB) to examine trends in dose selection and radiation technique over time, as well as any potential effect on outcome. Method(s): We queried the NCDB from 2004-2015 for cases of anal canal SCC stage 1-3, treated with definitive doses of XRT to the pelvis with chemo. Dose escalation was defined as > 54 Gy. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify factors predictive of increased dose and overall survival (OS). Propensity-adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios for survival were used to account for indication bias. Result(s): We identified 7,792 patients meeting the eligibility criteria, with 4,269 treated to conventional doses and 3,163 treated to > 54 Gy. Patients that were older, had government or private insurance, were treated with IMRT, or at an academic center in a more recent year were less likely to get dose escalation. Increasing T and N stage were predictive of escalated dose. The use of dose escalation decreased over time, from 50% in 2005 to 30% in 2015. In contrast, IMRT use increased over that time from 2% to 63%. On multivariable analysis increasing age, higher comorbidity score, treatment at an academic center, and increasing stage corresponded to worse OS. Increased income, private insurance, IMRT use, increased distance to facility, and female gender all predicted improved OS. Multivariable analysis with propensity score included confirmed increased age, higher comorbidity score, income, distance, and gender as predictive of OS. In addition, escalated dose was found to have inferior outcome (OR: 1.10 95%CI: 1.01-1.20, p = 0.03). Conclusion(s): The results of this NCDB analysis show a steady increase in the use of IMRT over time, with a corresponding decrease in dose escalation. In this study, dose escalation was shown to have inferior outcomes, although that result is likely influenced by the increasing age, stage, and comorbidity scores in that group of patients.",Excluded
63,"The role of cyberknife for pituitary metastases BACKGROUND: Pituitary metastases are found in 1.0-26.7% of cancer patients at autopsy. But clinically very rare. We evaluate the efficacy and safety of CyberKnife treatment in the management of metastatic cancer to the pituitary grand. PATIENTS 13 pituitary metastases (male 6, female 7). Age 47y-69y (median 53y). KPS 70. No previous irradiation. METHOD(S): Treatment system: CyberKnife (G3 or G4), Planning system: On target, Multiplan (Accuray), Calculation model: Ray tracing, Inverse algorithm, Immobilaization: thermoplastic mask, Image: CECT 1mm in thickness + MRI Gd T1WI 1-3mm in thickness, PTV = CTV = GTV, Verification: TLS (Target locating system), 6 axis correction. TREATMENT PROTOCOL: Marginal dose: D95PTV 95%, iso-dose line 80% (goal), Fractions: tumor size, adjacent to OAR (organs at risk), Tolerable dose of optic appratus: 12Gy (SRS), 21Gy (3fr.), 25Gy (5fr.), 28Gy (7fr.). Tumor volume (PTV): 0.5-18.2 cc (median 2.8 cc), Primary origin: Breast 5, Lung 2, Others 6. Clinical symptom: visual disturbance 11 (85%), diabetes insipidus 5 (38%), diplopia 1 (7.7%), asymptomatic 1 (7.7%). Marginal dose: 18-35 Gy (median 23Gy). RESULT(S): Follow up periods 4-31months. Progression free survival: 81.8% (@6m), 63.6% (@12m), 54.5% (@24m). Overall survival: 92.3% (@3m), 84.6% (@6m), 67.3% (@12m), 25.6% (@24m). Maximum dose for optic apparatus BED2 (Gy): 84-229 Gy (median 98.3Gy). Only 1 case became entirely blind 12 months after CyberKnife for 6 months until her death, despite tumor reduction. In this case, maximum dose for optic apparatus BED2 (Gy) was 229 Gy (highest). CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary results seem to indicate that CyberKnife SRT is a safe, effective and palliative treatment for most patients with pituitary metastasis.

1047,"Heterogeneity of Necrotic Changes between Cortical and Cancellous Bone in Mandibular Osteoradionecrosis: A Histopathological Analysis of Resection Margin after Segmental Mandibulectomy Background. This study aimed to analyze differences in necrotic changes between cortical and cancellous bone in resection margins after segmental mandibulectomy for advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis. Methods. Anteroposterior bone specimens from eleven patients who underwent segmental mandibulectomy with simultaneous free fibula flap reconstruction for advanced osteoradionecrosis were analyzed histopathologically for the presence of necrotic bone based on the presence of blood vessels within Haversian canals. Results. Ten of eleven (91%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the anterior margins were necrotic. All cancellous bones at the anterior margins were viable. Seven of eleven (64%) cortices near the inferior border of the mandible at the posterior margins were necrotic. Three of eleven (27%) cancellous bones at the posterior margins were necrotic. Conclusion. Necrotic changes are more prevalent in cortices than in cancellous bones in mandibular osteoradionecrosis, probably due to a decrease of periosteal blood supply caused by radiotherapy.Copyright © 2017 Masaya Akashi et al.",Excluded
2142,"Coronary artery calcium: 0.5 mm slice-thickness reconstruction with adjusted attenuation threshold outperforms 3.0 mm by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) images can be reconstructed with thinner slice thickness on some modern multidetector-row computed tomography scanners without additional radiation. We hypothesized that the isotropic 0.5-mm CAC reconstruction outperforms the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction in detecting and quantifying coronary calcium, and we proposed to compare them by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter-virtual histology (IVUS-VH)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, and 5976 mm of coronary arteries were analyzed. A semiautomatic software was developed to coregister CAC and IVUS-VH on a detailed slice-by-slice basis. Calcium detection and calcium volume quantification were evaluated and compared using varying calcium attenuation thresholds. Algorithms for deriving individualized optimal threshold and comparable Agatston score on the 0.5-mm reconstruction were developed., RESULTS: The isotropic 0.5-mm reconstruction achieved significantly higher area under receiver-operating curve than the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction (0.9 vs. 0.74, P < .001). Using the optimal threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction had higher sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.65), specificity (0.85 vs. 0.77), positive predictive value (0.42 vs. 0.29), and negative predictive value (0.97 vs. 0.94) than the 3.0 mm. Individualized optimal threshold was significantly correlated with the image noise (r = 0.66, P < .001) in the 0.5-mm reconstruction., CONCLUSIONS: By optimizing the calcium threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction is superior to the conventional 3.0-mm in detecting and quantifying calcium, which may improve the clinical value of CAC without additional radiation.

788,"G2 repair and chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers occupationally exposed to low-level ionizing radiation The effect of the G2 repair of chromosomal damage in lymphocytes from workers exposed to low levels of X- or gamma-rays was evaluated. Samples of peripheral blood were collected from 15 radiation workers, 20 subjects working in radiodiagnostics, and 30 healthy control donors. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were evaluated by scoring the presence of chromatid and isochromatid breaks, dicentric and ring chromosomes in lymphocytes with/without 5 mM caffeine plus 3 mM-aminobenzamide (3-AB) treatment during G2. Our results showed that the mean value of basal aberrations in lymphocytes from exposed workers was higher than in control cells (p < 0.001). The chromosomal damage in G2, detected with caffeine plus 3-AB treatment was higher than the basal damage (untreated conditions), both in control and exposed populations (p < 0.05). In the exposed workers group, the mean value of chromosomal abnormalities in G2 was higher than in the control (p < 0.0001). No correlation was found between the frequency of chromosome type of aberrations (basal or in G2), and the absorbed dose. Nevertheless, significant correlation coefficients (p < 0.05) between absorbed dose and basal aberrations yield (r = 0.430) or in G2 (r = 0.448) were detected when chromatid breaks were included in the total aberrations yield. Under this latter condition no significant effect of age, years of employment or smoking habit on the chromosomal aberrations yield was detected. However, analysis of the relationship between basal aberrations yield and the efficiency of G2 repair mechanisms, defined as the percentage of chromosomal lesions repaired in G2, showed a significant correlation coefficient (r = -0.802; p < 0.001). These results suggest that in addition to the absorbed dose, the individual G2 repair efficiency may be another important factor affecting the chromosomal aberrations yield detected in workers exposed to low-level ionizing radiation.",Included
2457,"The effect of low frame rate fluoroscopy on the X-ray dose during coronary intervention Objective The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of low frame rate fluoroscopy at 7.5 frames per second during coronary intervention could reduce radiation exposure in Japanese patients. Methods From December 10, 2014 to March 20, 2015, 84 consecutive patients with coronary artery disease who underwent coronary intervention in our institution were retrospectively collected and then divided into two groups: the LR group (fluoroscopy at 7.5 frames per second) and the OR group (fluoroscopy at 15 frames per second), according to the frame rate of fluoroscopy that was used in their treatment. Results There were no differences in the patient backgrounds or the procedural characteristics of the two groups. Although there were no differences in the contrast volume or fluoroscopy time, the total air kerma at the interventional reference point, which is used to monitor the patient's radiation dose, was significantly lower in the LR group than in the OR group (701.4+/-427.9 vs. 936.8+/-623.9 mGy, p=0.02). Conclusion Low frame rate fluoroscopy at 7.5 frames per second is safe and feasible for use during coronary interventions and an easy and useful strategy for reducing the radiation to which patients are exposed during coronary intervention.Copyright © 2016 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.",Excluded
2304,"A prospective study of 18FDG-PET with CT coregistration for radiation treatment planning of lymphomas and other hematologic malignancies Purpose This prospective single-institution study examined the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and computed tomography (CT) scan radiation treatment planning (TP) on target volume definition in lymphoma. Methods and Materials 118 patients underwent PET/CT TP during June 2007 to May 2009. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured on CT-only and PET/CT studies by radiation oncologists (ROs) and nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) for 95 patients with positive PET scans. Treatment plans and dose-volume histograms were generated for CT-only and PET/CT for 95 evaluable sites. Paired t test statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results 70 (74%) patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10 (11%) had Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 (10%) had plasma-cell neoplasm, and 3 (3%) had other hematologic malignancies. Forty-three (45%) presented with relapsed/refractory disease. Forty-five (47%) received no prior chemotherapy. The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by ROs in 38 patients (median, 27%; range, 5%-70%) and decreased GTV in 41 (median, 39.5%; range, 5%-80%). The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by NMPs in 27 patients (median, 26.5%; range, 5%-95%) and decreased GTV in 52 (median, 70%; range, 5%-99%). The intraobserver correlation between CT-GTV and PET-GTV was higher for ROs than for NMPs (0.94, P<.01 vs 0.89, P<.01). On the basis of Bland-Altman plots, the PET-GTVs defined by ROs were larger than those defined by NMPs. On evaluation of clinical TPs, only 4 (4%) patients had inadequate target coverage (D95 <95%) of the PET-GTV defined by NMPs. Conclusions Significant differences between the RO and NMP volumes were identified when PET was coregistered to CT for radiation planning. Despite this, the PET-GTV defined by ROs and NMPs received acceptable prescription dose in nearly all patients. However, given the potential for a marginal miss, consultation with an experienced PET reader is highly encouraged when PET/CT volumes are delineated, particularly for questionable lesions and to assure complete and accurate target volume coverage. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

2655,"Microvascular decompression after gamma knife surgery for trigeminal neuralgia: intraoperative findings and treatment outcomes OBJECT: The authors sought to determine whether the results of trigeminal microvascular decompression (MVD) are influenced by prior gamma knife surgery (GKS). METHOD(S): Gamma knife surgery is an established procedure for treating medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia but failures do occur. The authors assessed six patients (two men and four women; mean age 52 years) who experienced pain recurrence after GKS and elected to undergo trigeminal MVD via retrosigmoid craniotomy. Three patients underwent a single GKS to a maximal dose of 80 Gy, whereas three others underwent a second GKS to total of 120 to 135 Gy. At surgery, none of the six patients demonstrated excess arachnoid thickening, grossly apparent changes in the nerve itself, or any other tissue alterations that made successful mobilization of a blood vessel from the trigeminal root entry zone technically more difficult. A single individual had a small atherosclerotic plaque in the superior cerebellar artery near its contact point with the trigeminal nerve. Follow up at a mean of 25.4 months (range 7.5-42 months) indicated that five patients were pain free. One patient had improved but still relied on medications for pain control. CONCLUSION(S): In the authors' experience, trigeminal MVD can be performed without added difficulty in patients who have previously undergone GKS. The success rates seem similar to those normally associated with MVD. Patients who elect the less invasive option of GKS can be assured that trigeminal MVD remains a viable alternative at a later date if further surgery is required.",Excluded
2058,"Sunlight exposure and cardiovascular risk factors in the REGARDS study: A cross-sectional split-sample analysis Background: Previous research has suggested that vitamin D and sunlight are related to cardiovascular outcomes, but associations between sunlight and risk factors have not been investigated. We examined whether increased sunlight exposure was related to improved cardiovascular risk factor status. Method(s): Residential histories merged with satellite, ground monitor, and model reanalysis data were used to determine previous-year sunlight radiation exposure for 17,773 black and white participants aged 45+ from the US. Exploratory and confirmatory analyses were performed by randomly dividing the sample into halves. Logistic regression models were used to examine relationships with cardiovascular risk factors. Result(s): The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein levels in adjusted exploratory (-2.7 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -4.2, -1.2]) and confirmatory (-1.5 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -3.0, -0.1]) models. The lowest, compared to the highest quartile of insolation exposure was associated with higher systolic blood pressure levels in unadjusted exploratory and confirmatory, as well as the adjusted exploratory model (2.3 mmHg [95% confidence interval: 0.8, 3.8]), but not the adjusted confirmatory model (1.6 mg/dL [95% confidence interval: -0.5, 3.7]). Conclusion(s): The results of this study suggest that lower long-term sunlight exposure has an association with lower high-density lipoprotein levels. However, all associations were weak, thus it is not known if insolation may affect cardiovascular outcomes through these risk factors. © 2014 Kent et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2259,"A tumor growth inhibition model for low-grade glioma treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy Purpose: To develop a tumor growth inhibition model for adult diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Experimental Design: Using longitudinal mean tumor diameter (MTD) data from 21 patients treated with first-line procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy, we formulated a model consisting of a system of differential equations, incorporating tumorspecific and treatment-related parameters that reflect the response of proliferative and quiescent tumor tissue to treatment. The model was then applied to the analysis of longitudinal tumor size data in 24 patients treated with first-line temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and in 25 patients treated with first-line radiotherapy. Result(s): The model successfully described the MTD dynamics of LGG before, during, and after PCV chemotherapy. Using the same model structure, we were also able to successfully describe the MTD dynamics inLGGpatients treated withTMZchemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor-specific parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment modalities. The model is robust to sensitivity analysis, and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of pretreatment tumor size data. Conclusion(s): UsingMTDdata, we propose a tumor growth inhibition model able to describeLGGtumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the future, this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in LGG patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy schedules. ©2012 AACR.",Excluded
344,"Radiation-induced and transposon-induced chromosome damage in Drosophila: translocations and transmission distortion The possible interaction between X-ray- and transposon-induced chromosome damage was monitored in the P-M system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. One- to two-day-old F1 dysgenic males originating from a cross between M strain females and P strain males were irradiated with 5.5 Gy (550 rad) or used as controls to monitor X-Y translocations and transmission ratio distortion. Two 3-day sperm broods were sampled for the former and two 4-day broods for the latter to detect damage induced in the most radiosensitive cells. F1 nondysgenic males derived from M female to M male crosses (controls) were treated identically. X-Y chromosome translocations induced by P element mobility alone declined sharply with a decrease in temperature (18 versus 21 degrees C) and they were significantly reduced with aging of hybrid males from brood 2, 4-8 days of age, to brood 3, 7-11 days of age. No significant increase in translocations was observed when X irradiation and P-M dysgenesis were combined, showing no interaction between damages induced by the two mutator systems. In contrast, interaction was observed in transmission ratio distortion which was significantly increased by X irradiation of hybrid males derived from both reciprocal M X P and P x M crosses. The preferential elimination of P element-bearing autosomes occurred when either spermatocytes or spermatids were irradiated. An aging effect was also observed, resulting in less distortion in 9- to 14-day-old dysgenic males compared to 5- to 10-day-old hybrids.",Included
2964,"Late temporal lobe necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: evaluation with combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging Late temporal lobe necrosis is a well-known and serious complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy. Owing to the close proximity to the skull base, the medial temporal lobes are inevitably included in the target volume of irradiation. Patients with NPC provide a unique opportunity in study of delay radiation effect in normal human brain. The objective of this study was to evaluate late temporal lobe radiation injury by combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. We prospectively studied 16 patients with typical clinical symptoms of late temporal lobe necrosis or other abnormalities in the temporal lobes incidentally detected by conventional MR imaging. All patients had a previous history of radiotherapy for histologically proven NPC. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, fast gradient echo with echo-planar diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map were computed via commercially available software. MR diffusion and perfusion images were then analyzed and graded by two independent observers with focusing on the diffusion and perfusion mismatch. The temporal lobe lesions displayed marked high diffusion on the ADC map. The rCBV map also revealed marked hypoperfusion in these temporal lobe lesions in all patients. The areas of abnormality on the rCBV map were significantly larger than the lesions on the ADC map in 14 patients (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2). Since late temporal lobe necrosis is probably caused by damage of the endothelium of vessels and ischemia, perfusion and diffusion mismatch might imply injured tissue but potentially salvageable brain tissue. A mismatch may be potentially used to predict the response to treatment in-patients with late temporal lobe necrosis.",Excluded

Method(s): We retrospectively analysed 200 patients (100 male, 100 female; mean age 61.2 +/- 13.5 years, mean body mass index 27.5 +/- 3.8 kg/m2) equally divided into four groups matched by gender and body mass index, who had undergone portal venous phase abdominal CT with second-generation (group A, 120-kV-SECT; group B, 80/140-kV-DECT) and third-generation DSCT (group C, 100-kV-SECT; group D, 90/150-kV-DECT). The radiation dose was normalised for 40-cm scan length. Dose-independent figure-of-merit (FOM) contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for various organs and vessels. Subjective overall image quality and reader confidence were assessed. Result(s): The effective normalised radiation dose was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in groups C (6.2 +/- 2.0 mSv) and D (5.3 +/- 1.9 mSv, P = 0.103) compared to groups A (8.8 +/- 2.3 mSv) and B (9.7 +/- 2.4 mSv, P = 0.102). Dose-independent FOM-CNR peaked for liver, kidney, and portal vein measurements (all P <= 0.0285) in group D. Subjective image quality and reader confidence were consistently rated as excellent in all groups (all >=1.53 out of 5). Conclusion(s): With both DSCT generations, abdominal DECT can be routinely performed without radiation dose penalty compared to SECT, while third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency. Key Points: * Dual-source CT (DSCT) allows for single- and dual-energy image acquisition. * Dual-energy acquisition does not increase the radiation dose in abdominal DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency compared to second-generation DSCT. * Dose-independent figure-of-merit image contrast was highest with third-generation dual-energy DSCT. * Third-generation DSCT shows improved dose efficiency for SECT and DECT.Copyright © 2016, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
2433,"Tumour size in cancer of the cervix In a randomized trial comprising 204 patients with operable cervical carcinomas stages I and II, two low-dose rates in gynaecological brachytherapy were compared. Treatment consisted of Cs-137 uterovaginal application followed by surgery (either immediate or delayed). The results for the two dose rates have been published previously. The present paper concerns the correlation between outcome and tumour size. Tumour size was carefully estimated in two ways: by clinical examination under general anaesthesia and by measurements on the customized vaginal mould used for the brachytherapy. Ninety-one patients (45%) were classified as stage I, and 113 were classified as stage II proximal. The mean tumour size was 39 mm (range 15-64 mm). Cox's multivariate analysis indicated that the factors with a poor prognostic value were for survival: node involvement (N +) (p < 0.001), large tumour size (T +) (p < 0.001) and involvement of the endocervix (E +) (p <0.01); for event-free survival: N + (p <0.001), T + (p < 0.001); for local control; N + (p = 0.0001); for metastasis and regional relapse: N + (p < 0.001) and T + (p < 0.001). Stage was not a prognostic factor over the present range in either univariate or multivariate analysis. In this series tumour size is a powerful independent prognostic factor. It is therefore suggested that for the classification of cervical cancer and the indications for surgical staging and adjuvant treatment, tumour size should be taken into account.",Excluded

Astronaut-subjects were tasked with walking on a treadmill at 6.4 km/h while fixating a visual target 30 cm away from their eyes after space flights of 8-15 days. Surface electromyography was collected from selected lower limb muscles and normalized with regard to mean amplitude and temporal relation to heel strike. In general, high correlations (more than 0.80) were found between preflight and postflight activation waveforms for each muscle and each subject: however relative activation amplitude around heel strike and toe off was changed as a result of flight. The level of muscle cocontraction and activation variability, and the relationship between the phasic characteristics of the ankle musculature in preparation for toe off also were altered by space flight. Subjects also reported oscillopsia during treadmill walking after flight. These findings indicate that, after space flight, the sensory-motor system can generate neuromuscular-activation strategies that permit treadmill walking, but subtle changes in lower-limb neuromuscular activation are present that may contribute to increased lower limb kinematic variability and oscillopsia also present during postflight walking.",Excluded
439,"Mortality from diseases other than cancer following low doses of ionizing radiation: results from the 15-Country Study of nuclear industry workers BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation at very high (radio-therapeutic) dose levels can cause diseases other than cancer, particularly heart diseases. There is increasing evidence that doses of the order of a few sievert (Sv) may also increase the risk of non-cancer diseases. It is not known, however, whether such effects also occur following the lower doses and dose rates of public health concern., METHODS: We used data from an international (15-country) nuclear workers cohort study to evaluate whether mortality from diseases other than cancer is related to low doses of external ionizing radiation. Analyses included 275 312 workers with adequate information on socioeconomic status, over 4 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative radiation dose of 20.7 mSv; 11 255 workers had died of non-cancer diseases., RESULTS: The excess relative risk (ERR) per Sv was 0.24 [95% CI (confidence intervals) -0.23, 0.78] for mortality from all non-cancer diseases and 0.09 (95% CI -0.43, 0.70) for circulatory diseases. Higher risk estimates were observed for mortality from respiratory and digestive diseases, but confidence intervals included zero. Increased risks were observed among the younger workers (attained age <50 years, identified post hoc) for all groupings of non-cancer causes of death, including external causes. It is unclear therefore whether these findings reflect real effects of radiation, random variation or residual confounding., CONCLUSIONS: The most informative low-dose radiation study to date provides little evidence for a relationship between mortality from non-malignant diseases and radiation dose. However, we cannot rule out risks per unit dose of the same order of magnitude as found in studies at higher doses.",Included
981,"Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for lymph node staging in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in nonoperable patients pursuing radiotherapy as a primary treatment Introduction: Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is a promising modality with excellent localization and significant biologic effects on tumors. Nevertheless, success depends primarily on accurate staging before radiotherapy. Surgical interventions should be avoided in patients considered for CIRT because they usually have multiple comorbidities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for lymph node staging in patients with non-small cell lung cancer before CIRT. Method(s): From April 2005 to December 2007, 49 patients with non-small cell lung cancer considered for CIRT with abnormal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) accumulations in the mediastinum and/or hilum were evaluated by EBUS-TBNA. The convex probe EBUS was used for EBUS-TBNA. Result(s): There were 38 men and 11 women. Their mean age was 75.2 years (range: 55-87). Based on PET-CT, clinical staging was four with N1 disease, 42 with N2 disease, and three with N3 disease. By histology, 26 patients had adenocarcinoma, 19 had squamous cell carcinoma, and four had other histologies. All positive lymph nodes on PET-CT were aspirated (range: 1-5; average 2.55 lymph nodes/patient). EBUS-TBNA diagnosed 43 cases as N0 disease and as a result underwent CIRT. Forty of the 43 cases remained in stable condition without local recurrences (follow-up 6-46 months). The diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA for lymph node staging was 93.9%. Conclusion(s): EBUS-TBNA offers accurate minimally invasive lymph node staging in patients who are candidates for CIRT. EBUS-TBNA can be safely performed with a high diagnostic accuracy before CIRT. © 2010 by the International Association for the study of lung cancer.",Excluded

Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy has improved the local control rate and overall survival in locally advanced rectal cancers. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. Method(s): Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. Result(s): A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. Conclusion(s): Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation. Also, pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment has its oncologic benefit in both overall recurrence and disease-free survival. © 2007 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
1032,"Epidemiological and clinical aspects in 1100 patients with plasmacytoma 1,100 patients at University of Freiburg Medical Center and at the Institute of Pathology with newly diagnosed plasmacytoma between 1943 and 1989 were identified. Records for these patients were reviewed and the incidence, association with age and employment, distribution of the sexes, tumor stage and survival time and development of secondary tumors were analyzed. The incidence rate of plasmacytoma is increasing within the last decades. Average annual incidence rate at the early 90ies was 6 per 100,000 population. Plasmacytoma mainly occurs in older patients and increases in incidence with age. The median age for diagnosis was 65 years for males and 68 years for females. 10% of patients are under 50 years of age at time of diagnosis. Neither significant association with employment nor association with exposure to hazardous goods could be seen. Males and females are affected 1:1. Secondary malignant tumors could be detected in 7,6%. If plasmacytoma is the secondary tumor, 50% of patients were treated before with ionizing radiation because of their first tumor.

3339,"A model to predict the risk of lethal nasopharyngeal necrosis after re-irradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients BACKGROUND: For patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who undergo re-irradiation with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), lethal nasopharyngeal necrosis (LNN) is a severe late adverse event. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for LNN and develop a model to predict LNN after radical re-irradiation with IMRT in patients with recurrent NPC., METHODS: Patients who underwent radical re-irradiation with IMRT for locally recurrent NPC between March 2001 and December 2011 and who had no evidence of distant metastasis were included in this study. Clinical characteristics, including recurrent carcinoma conditions and dosimetric features, were evaluated as candidate risk factors for LNN. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors and construct the predictive scoring model., RESULTS: Among 228 patients enrolled in this study, 204 were at risk of developing LNN based on risk analysis. Of the 204 patients treated, 31 (15.2%) developed LNN. Logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (P = 0.008), necrosis before re-irradiation (P = 0.008), accumulated total prescription dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) >=145.5 Gy (P = 0.043), and recurrent tumor volume >=25.38 cm(3) (P = 0.009) were independent risk factors for LNN. A model to predict LNN was then constructed that included these four independent risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: A model that includes sex, necrosis before re-irradiation, accumulated total prescription dose to GTV, and recurrent tumor volume can effectively predict the risk of developing LNN in NPC patients who undergo radical re-irradiation with IMRT.",Excluded
1020,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded

In exchanges between autosomes, during the S phase, a clear prevalence of asymmetrical rejoining was observed. Later, this prevalence became reduced as the cell approached mitosis. On the other hand, in the exchanges between X-chromosomes in the females there were no significant variations in the type of rejoining through the cell cycle, there being a slight but consistent preference for symmetrical rejoining.

2208,"Polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 and lung cancer risk We explored the association between polymorphisms of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 (codons 194, 280, and 399) and lung cancer risk in a case-control study nested within a cohort of tin miners. Cases were those diagnosed with lung cancer over 6 years of follow-up (n = 108). Two controls, matched on age and sex, were selected for each case by incidence density sampling. Of the three polymorphisms, only the XRCC1 Arg280His allele was associated with increased lung cancer risk (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) after adjustment for radon and tobacco exposure. In addition, individuals with the variant Arg280His allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at higher risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype. Conversely, individuals with the variant Arg194Trp allele who were alcohol drinkers seemed to be at lower risk for lung cancer compared with those with the homozygous wild-type genotype.

2904,"Biological dosimetry using the micronucleus assay for lymphocytes: interindividual differences in dose response The dose response of the number of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes after in-vitro irradiation of whole blood with x rays in the dose range 0-4 Gy was studied for a heterogeneous population of 10 donors. One thousand binucleated cells were systematically scored for micronuclei. A linear-quadratic dose dependency of the micronucleus yields was observed. The data were used to derive the accuracy of the dose assessment with the technique in case of a radiation accident. It was shown that for doses of 2 Gy and higher, the uncertainty of the dose was predominantly due to interindividual differences in the x-ray-induced micronucleus yields. At the 95% confidence level, doses lower than 0.3 Gy could not be unequivocally detected with the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay due to the variability of the baseline micronucleus frequency within the donor population and the poor statistical accuracy when scoring 1,000 cells. The precision and sensitivity of the method in the low-dose range could be improved by the knowledge of individual pre-irradiation baseline values and an increase of the number of cells scored by automation of the technique.",Excluded
2184,"Endovascular beta-radiation to reduce restenosis after coronary balloon angioplasty: Results of the beta energy restenosis trial (BERT) Background - In the porcine overstretch injury model of restenosis, endovascular beta-radiation reduces neointima formation. To determine whether this therapy could be applied to patients with coronary artery disease, a special device was developed to allow delivery of 12 encapsulated 90Sr/Y sources, measuring a total of 30 mm, to various sites within the coronary arterial tree. This study was designed to evaluate the feasibility of the delivery of 12, 14, or 16 Gy at 2 mm after balloon angioplasty of stenoses of native coronary vessels. Methods and Results - Delivery of beta-radiation was attempted in 23 patients after successful balloon angioplasty. Source delivery was successful in 21 of the 23 patients (91%). There was no in- hospital or 30-day morbidity or mortality. Follow-up quantitative coronary arteriography in 20 patients demonstrated a late loss of 0.05 mm, a late loss index of 4%, and a restenosis rate of 15%. The use of the beta-emitter 90Sr/Y significantly reduced treatment time and operator exposure compared with previous trials with the gamma-emitter 192Ir. Conclusions - In this study, the administration of endovascular beta-radiation after angioplasty was safe and feasible and substantially altered the postangioplasty late lumen loss, resulting in a lower-than-expected rate of restenosis. On the basis of these encouraging results, a multicenter, randomized trial with operators and patients blinded to treatment assignment is planned.",Excluded

2382,"Patients' Perceptions of Proton Pump Inhibitor Risks and Attempts at Discontinuation: A National Survey OBJECTIVES: Little is known about how reports on the adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) impact patients' perceptions of these drugs and medication use. We sought to determine patients' level of concern about PPI adverse effects and its association with attempts to discontinue these drugs., METHODS: This study is an online survey of US adults who use PPIs for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Topics included awareness of and concern about PPI adverse effects, prior discussion with providers, and attempts to stop PPI because of concern about adverse effects. For the primary analysis, we used logistic regression to identify associations between having attempted to stop PPI and concern about PPI-related adverse effects, a provider's recommendation to stop, risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), age, and gender., RESULTS: Among 755 patient participants, mean age was 49 years (s.d. 16), 71% were women, and 24% were at high risk of UGIB. Twenty percent of patients were able to write in >=1 reported adverse effect, and 46% endorsed awareness of >=1 adverse effect when presented with a list, most commonly chronic kidney disease (17%). Thirty-three percent of patients were slightly concerned, 32% somewhat concerned, and 14% extremely concerned about adverse effects. Twenty-four percent of patients had discussed PPI risks and benefits with a provider, and 9% had been recommended to stop. Thirty-nine percent had attempted to stop their PPI, most (83%) without a provider recommendation. Factors associated with an attempt at stopping PPI included: (i) provider recommendation to stop (odds ratio [OR] 3.26 [1.82-5.83]); (ii) concern about adverse effects (OR 5.13 [2.77-9.51] for slightly, 12.0 [6.51-22.2] for somewhat, and 19.4 [9.75-38.7] for extremely concerned); and (iii) female gender (OR 1.64 [1.12-2.39]). Patients at high risk of UGIB were as likely to have attempted to stop as others (OR 0.98 [0.66-1.44])., CONCLUSIONS: Concern about PPIs is common and strongly associated with attempts at discontinuation, even without a provider's recommendation. Notably, individuals at high risk of UGIB, who benefit from PPIs, were equally likely to have tried stopping PPIs as others. Providers should proactively discuss the risks and benefits of PPIs with their patients, who may otherwise make unwise decisions about PPI management on their own.",Excluded
2675,"Multifaceted applications of pre-mature chromosome condensation in radiation biodosimetry Background: Biodosimetry with persistent cytogenetic indicators in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) plays crucial role in regulatory/medical management of individuals overexposed to radiation. Conventional methods require ~48 h culture and have limited dose range (0.1-5Gy) applications due to checkpoint arrest/poor stimulation. G0-Phase Premature chromosome condensation (G0-PCC) allows chromosome aberration analysis within hours after blood collection. Due to high skill demand, applications of G0-PCC were not very well explored and being re-visited worldwide. Among all aberrations, analysis of excess chromosomal fragments is quickest. Radiation dose response curve for the fragments has been reported. Purpose(s): In present study, excess fragment analysis has been addressed in detail, in addition to validation of radiation dose response curve, gender variation in the response, dose dependent repair kinetics, minimum detection limit (MDL), duration and accuracy of final dose estimation with 5blindfolded, ex vivo irradiated samples have been studied. In extension, feasibility of multiparametric dosimetry with Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based endpoints were qualitatively explored. Material(s) and Method(s): PBLs were exposed to Gamma-Radiation and G0-PCC was performed at different time points. Decay kinetics and dose response curve were established. Gender Variation of the frequency of the fragments was assessed at 0, 2 and 4 Gy. FISH was performed with G0-PCC applying centromere probe, whole chromosome paints, multi-color FISH and multi-color banding probes. Result(s): Radiation response curve for fragments was found to be linear (Slope 1.09 +/- 0.031 Gy-1). Background frequency as well as dose response did not show significant gender bias. Based on variation in background frequency of fragments MDL was calculated to be ~0.3 Gy. Kinetics of fragment tested at 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h showed exponential decay pattern from 0 to 8 h and without further decay. Final dose estimation of five samples was completed within 13 man-hours. Dicentric chromosomes, translocations, insertions and breaks were identifiable in combination with centromere FISH and WCP. Advanced methods employing multicolor FISH and multi-color banding were also demonstrated with PCC spreads. Conclusion(s): G0-PCC, can be useful tool for high dose biodosimetry with quick assessment of fragment frequency. Further, it holds potential for multi-parametric dosimetry in combination with FISH.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Included

Method(s): The cases of 94 patients with stage I-II NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type in the upper aerodigestive tract who treated between May 2005 and Dec 2008 were reviewed. These patients received radiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy. Definitive radiotherapy was conducted using 3DCRT in 47 patients and IMRT in the other 47 patients with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy. Dosimetric pmeters of radiation treatment plans, local control probability (LCP), overall survival (OS), and toxicities were analyzed and compared between 3DCRT and IMRT. Result(s): From the dosimetric analysis, IMRT demonstrated significantly better dose coverage and homogeneity than 3DCRT. However, after a median follow-up of 46 months, IMRT was not associated with improvements in 4y-OS (80.9% for 3DCRT vs. 82.7% for IMRT, p=0.87) or 4y-LCP (86.3% for 3DCRT vs. 88.9% for IMR p=0.85). Of the 18 patients who received cervical lymph node irradiation, those in the IMRT group received a lower mean parotid dose. Furthermore, at-risk organs were strictly kept within the safe dose range in both groups, and no severe late toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): IMRT provided better dose coverage than 3DCRT, although it failed to provide LCP and OS benefits. Definitive radiotherapy with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy is efficient and safe for NK/T-cell lymphoma using either IMRT or 3DCRT. However, IMRT may have the potential to reduce parotid gland hypofunction following cervical irradiation. © 2013 Shen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

To determine the radiation fields in an organ or tissue of interest, particle transport calculations are performed using self-shielding distributions generated with the computer program CAMERA to represent the human body. CAMERA mathematically traces linear rays (or path lengths) through the computerized anatomical man (CAM) phantom, a computational stylized model developed in the early 1970s with organ and body profiles modeled using solid shapes and scaled to represent the body morphometry of the 1950 50th percentile (PCTL) Air Force male. With the increasing use of voxel phantoms in medical and health physics, a conversion from a mathematical-based to a voxel-based ray-tracing algorithm is warranted. In this study, the voxel-based ray tracer (VoBRaT) is introduced to ray trace voxel phantoms using a modified version of the algorithm first proposed by Siddon (1985 Med. Phys. 12 252-5). After validation, VoBRAT is used to evaluate variations in body self-shielding distributions for NASA phantoms and six University of Florida (UF) hybrid phantoms, scaled to represent the 5th, 50th, and 95th PCTL male and female astronaut body morphometries, which have changed considerably since the inception of CAM.

Carcinogenic effect from cigarette smoke was the most relevant interest in our study, which has included 7,609 cases of lung cancer and 10,431 controls, mainly population based. The results indicate elevated odds ratios (ORs; 23.9 among men and 8.7 among women) with attributable risks exceeding 90% for men and close to 60% for women. A large, and statistically significant, variability of the results across countries was detected after adjusting for the most common confounding variables, and after controlling, at least in part, for the instability of the ORs due to the small number of non-smokers in some of the study subsets. This pattern of lung cancer risk associated with cigarettes smoke, across different European regions, reflects inherent characteristics of the studies as well as differences in smoking habits, particularly calender periods of starting, and it is likely to have been influenced by effect modifiers like indoor radon exposure, occupation, air pollution and dietary habits. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded

Uneven distribution of the dosage is provided by using a grid diaphragm and conducting gamma-therapy only from one static field during the whole course of irradiation. This pattern of radiotherapy is shown to increase radioresistance of normal tissues and allows 1.5--4 times large focal dose to be applied to tumor compared with gamma-therapy via moving lead strips, thus rendering an enhanced antitumor effect of radiation.

However, 5 to 10% of all individuals show increased acute and/or late reactions. In-vitro test systems are investigated for their suitability for predictive purposes. This paper attempts a correlation between the induction and repair of DNA damage measured in the comet assay and the clinical observed reaction in order to evaluate the suitability of the comet assay for prediction of radiation sensitivity. Patients and Methods: Skin fibroblasts of 30 patients with average tissue reactions or acute and/or late increased side effects and cell lines of 4 individuals carrying the heritable disease ataxia telangiectasia (AT) were irradiated in vitro. The induction and repair of DNA damage was measured at different time points after irradiation in the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). These results were compared to the acute and late clinical reactions classified according to the RTOG grading system. Result(s): The radiation induced DNA damage decreased over time reflecting DNA repair. Cells of the AT individuals showed an elevated damage induction and a reduced repair capacity compared to patients with average tissue reactions. Fibroblasts of patients with increased acute and late side effects exhibited slower DNA repair. In addition to the known lack of cell cycle control, our results indicate that AT cells show reduced DNA repair capacity. Conclusion(s): The comet assay seems to be able to detect some types of increased individual radiation sensitivity. In contrast to other predictive in-vitro tests, the comet assay needs less time and fewer cells, which would be useful in a clinical setting.",Included

Thyroid cancer odds were highest in the isthmus (odds ratio [OR] = 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-3.6, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate regression model adjusting for age, sex, family history of thyroid cancer, radiation exposure, nodule size, and American College of Radiology (ACR) TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) score, the isthmus nodules had the highest risk of malignancy (OR = 2.4 [CI 1.5-3.9], p = 0.0007), followed by upper thyroid nodules (OR = 1.8 [CI 1.2-2.7], p = 0.005) and then middle thyroid nodules (OR = 1.5 [CI 1.1-2.0], p = 0.01) compared with lower thyroid nodules. Isthmus nodules were significantly smaller in size compared with middle (p < 0.0001) and lower (p = 0.0004), but not upper nodules (p = 0.25), with a mean size of 15.5 mm (+/-10.7). Conclusion(s): Thyroid nodule location is an independent risk factor in predicting the risk of thyroid cancer. Isthmic nodules carry the highest risk of cancer diagnosis and lower lobe nodules carry the lowest risk.© Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",Excluded
1857,"Increased occurrence of exfoliation in the male, Spanish American population of New Mexico Exfoliation syndrome was found to occur much more frequently in the male Spanish American population of New Mexico. This was based on a Veterans Administration Medical Center study in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The prevalence of exfoliation in the Spanish Americans was estimated to be from 3-6 percent and this is consistent with many other such studies performed in the United States and other countries. The Spanish American population is 5.8 times more likely to develop exfoliation than the non-Spanish American population of New Mexico. Exfoliation was found on such eye structures as the lens, iris, ciliary processes, posterior capsule, vitreous face, posterior corneal surface, and arterial chamber angle. Glaucoma capsulare was also studied and it was found that there was not a significant difference between the Spanish American and the non-Spanish American population for developing the condition. However, there was a strong association of glaucoma with the presence of exfoliation in both groups. Based on our results, patients with exfoliation are 22 times more likely to develop glaucoma than are their age-matched controls. Also, 40 percent of the exfoliation patients had glaucoma compared with only 5 percent of the age-matched controls (p less than .001). The patients with glaucoma capsulare were found to have a more medically resistant type of glaucoma, which was consistent with other reports of this condition. There are two theories we propose for the existence of exfoliation in the Spanish American population of New Mexico. The first is a geographic climatic theory that relates exfoliation to greater solar radiation levels due to a high overall altitude and sunny weather in New Mexico.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Excluded
2402,"Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells produce large quantities of bioactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after radiation exposure PURPOSE: In the present study, we examined human Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cell lines that are able to produce TNF-alpha as part of the response to irradiation. Radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may enhance irradiation efficacy and improve the effect of local tumor irradiation. On the other hand, radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may adversely affect the normal tissue., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve different ES/pPNET cell lines were investigated in vitro and (after establishment as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice) in vivo for their TNF-alpha mRNA expression (real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and TNF-alpha protein production (in vitro: enhanced amplified sensitivity immunoassay; in vivo: immunohistochemistry) after exposure to different irradiation doses (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Gy) and after different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after irradiation). The bioactivity of the TNF-alpha protein was evaluated in chromogenic cytotoxicity and neutralization assays., RESULTS: Nine out of 12 ES/pPNET cell lines express constitutively significant quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha in vitro. ES/pPNET cells originating from primary tumors secreted higher TNF-alpha levels than cells derived from metastatic lesions. In 5 of the 9 TNF-alpha-producing cell lines, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were upregulated after irradiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After establishment of the ES/pPNET cell lines in athymic nude mice, the radiation-induced TNF-alpha release could be demonstrated also in the xenograft tumors in vivo (analogous to the in vitro experiments). Using the same methods for quantitative analysis, it was determined that the TNF-alpha expression of the radiation-responsive tumor cells was up to 2000-fold higher compared to the maximal radiation-induced TNF-alpha release in normal lung tissue measured during the pneumonic phase., CONCLUSION: Certain ES/pPNET cell lines produce extremely large quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha after radiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation-induced TNF-alpha production of tumor cells may be of paramount importance in respect to not only tumor behavior, but also to potential damage to normal tissue and the clinical status of the host.",Included
159,"Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation improves deglutition in Parkinson's disease Relatively little is known about the role of the basal ganglia in human deglutition. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) affords us a model for examining deglutition in humans with known impairment of the basal ganglia. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of subthalamic nuclei (STN) DBS on the oral and pharyngeal stages of deglutition in individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD). It was hypothesized that DBS would be associated with improved deglutition. Within participant, comparisons were made between DBS in the ON and OFF conditions using the dependent variables: pharyngeal transit time, maximal hyoid bone excursion, oral total composite score, and pharyngeal total composite score. Significant improvement occurred for the pharyngeal composite score and pharyngeal transit time in the DBS ON condition compared with DBS OFF. Stimulation of the STN may excite thalamocortical or brainstem targets to sufficiently overcome the bradykinesia/hypokinesia associated with PD and return some pharyngeal stage motor patterns to performance levels approximating those of normal"" deglutition. However, the degree of hyoid bone excursion and oral stage measures did not improve, suggesting that these motor acts may be under the control of different sensorimotor pathways within the basal ganglia.

843,"Preoperative downstaging chemoradiation with concurrent irinotecan and capecitabine in MRI-defined locally advanced rectal cancer: A phase i trial (NWCOG-2) Background:The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of neoadjuvant chemoradiation using radiotherapy (RT) combined with concurrent capecitabine and irinotecan for locally advanced rectal cancer before surgery. Method(s):Forty-six patients were recruited and treated on the basis that MRI scanning had shown poor-risk tumours with threatening (1 mm) or involvement of the mesorectal fascia. Conformal RT was given using 3 or 4 fields at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 days per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. Concurrently oral capecitabine was given twice daily throughout radiotherapy continuously from days 1 to 35 and intravenous irinotecan was given once per week during weeks 1 to 4 of RT. Dose levels were gradually escalated as follows. Dose level 1: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 50 mg m 2; Dose level 2: capecitabine 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 3: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 60 mg m 2; Dose level 4: capecitabine 825 mg m 2 b.i.d. and irinotecan 70 mg m 2. Result(s):Diarrhoea (grade 3, no grade 4) was the main serious acute toxicity with lesser degrees of fatigue, neutropenia, anorexia and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. The recommended dose for future study was dose level 2 at which 3 of 14 patients (21%) developed grade 3 diarrhoea. Postoperative complications included seven pelvic or wound infections and two anastomotic and two perineal wound dehiscences. There were no deaths in the first 30 days postoperatively. Of 41 resected specimens, 11 (27%) showed a pathological complete response (pCR) and five (12%) showed an involved circumferential resection margin (defined as 1 mm). The 3-year disease-free survival (intent-to-treat) was 53.2%. Conclusion(s):In patients with poor-risk MRI-defined locally advanced rectal cancer threatening or involving the mesorectal fascia, preoperative chemoradiation based on RT at 45 Gy in 25 daily fractions over 5 weeks with continuous daily oral capecitabine at 650 mg m 2 b.i.d. days 1-35 and weekly IV irinotecan at 60 mg m 2 weeks 1-4, provides acceptable acute toxicity and postoperative morbidity with encouraging response and curative resection rates. © 2009 Cancer Research UK.",Excluded
2424,"DNA damage and repair of head and neck cancer cells after radio- and chemotherapy DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included
165,"Abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT): proof of principle in an experimental model of colon cancer The aim of the present study was to evaluate, for the first time, the abscopal effect of boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3. The present study performed in a simple animal model provides proof of principle that the positive response of a tumor to BNCT is capable of inducing an abscopal effect.",Excluded
3177,"SAR values of mobile phones. Safety evaluation and risk perception The specific absorption rate (SAR) is a prominent topic in the discussion about precautionary health protection. An experimental study investigated the effect of information about various SAR values (below the existing partial body limit value of 2 W/kg) on safety judgments of potential mobile phones users. It turns out that about 94% of the participants do not know the SAR value of their own mobile phone. SAR values below existing limits are not perceived as equally safe. Rather, the lower the SAR value, the higher the perceived safety. However, a majority of the participants does not consider these SAR values to be 100% safe, even if they are clearly below the existing limits. Explicitly indicating a precautionary limit value (referring to the Federal Office for Radiation Protection or to consumer organizations) does not change this safety evaluation. As expected, safety evaluation of the SAR values is also related to the perception of mobile phone risks. Those who are concerned about mobile phone communication give lower safety judgments than the unconcerned-independent of the level of the SAR values. Irrespective of that, our results suggest that establishing the SAR value as a criterion for mobile phones depends first of all on making it known to the public.",Excluded
774,"Epidemiology and environmental risk in hairy cell leukemia Hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) is an orphan subtype of leukaemia which constitutes less than 2% of all leukaemia's, with an incidence of less than 1 per 100,000 persons per annum. Median age at presentation is 55 years and it is 3-4 times more frequent in males. It is also more frequently encountered in whites and less in Asians, Africans and Arabs. The epidemiologic data are multi-factorial and influenced by ethnicity and geographical factors. Other reported associations relate to some environmental exposures and possible occupational factors. Smoking appears to have an inverse correlation with the development of hairy cell leukaemia, while farming and exposure to pesticides, petroleum products, diesel and ionizing radiation have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk. National and international collaborative efforts are needed in order to undertake more extensive studies involving larger patient cohorts, aiming to determine the role of occupational and environmental risk factors in the development of this rare form of chronic leukaemia.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1515,"Influence of cartilage lesions in the lateral compartment on clinical outcome following medial openwedge osteotomy Objectives: High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is an established treatment method for cartilage damage of the medial compartment with concurrent varus deformity. The influence of lateral compartment cartilage lesions on the final clinical outcome remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of those lesions on the functional outcome in patients suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and undergoing a valgus high tibial osteotomy. Method(s): From January 2005 to December 2013, there were 156 patients, suffering from cartilage damage of the medial compartment and an underlying varus deformity, who were treated by a biplane HTO. In all of the cases, a preoperative diagnostic arthroscopy was performed, and the presence of underlying cartilage lesions of the lateral compartment (LC) was assessed and evaluated using the ICRS classification. Preoperatively, the Lysholm score, pain levels (VAS) as well as the presence of pain in the lateral compartment were recorded. Clinical outcome parameters were raised at final follow-up (post-OP: VAS, Lysholm, KOOS, IKDC, WOMAC). Analysis of the pre-and post-operatively recorded X-Rays was performed by means of using a planning software (mediCAD\, Hectec GmbH, Germany), as well as a statistical analysis was carried out with the aid of SPSS Statistics 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA.) software. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result(s): 37 patients (= 24%) had noticed pain in the LC before the day of surgery. 76. 3% (n = 119, group A) of the patients had no cartilage damage of the LC, 10.3% (n = 16) had a single lesion of the lateral tibial plateau or femoral condyle (group B), 13.4% (n = 21) had corresponding lesions of the LC (group C). Preoperatively, there were no differences between the groups concerning mean follow-up, BMI, the Lysholm score or VAS score (p > 0.05). Differences could be found concerning patient age (group A, B > group C; p > 0.001) and preoperative varus deformity (group A < group B,C; p < 0.003). In all patients, HTO was planed aiming for a comparable mild postoperative valgus alignment (p = 0.53). With regard to clinical outcome parameters, group A had the best results reaching statistical significance in the final WOMACpain score (p = 0.032) and WOMACfunction score (p = 0.049). ICRS score of the LC cartilage lesions correlated significantly with WOMACpain and the WOMACfunction. Nonetheless, all of the groups A to C showed a significant increase in the Lysholm score (p< 0.001) and decrease in pain level (VAS score) at final follow up (p < 0.001). Preoperative patient selection prior to the performance of a valgus high tibial osteotomy is of major importance. Presence of cartilage damage of the lateral compartment is adversely influencing final clinical outcome and has to be seen as a relative contraindication for valgus high tibial osteotomy. Nonetheless, even in those patients a significant improvement of functional parameters and decrease of pain levels can be observed.",Excluded
1173,"Low-dose MDCT for surveillance of patients with severe homogeneous emphysema after bronchoscopic airway bypass OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of low-dose MDCT for radiologic monitoring of patients who have undergone placement of bronchial stents for airway bypass., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a prospective study, seven patients underwent MDCT according to a low-dose protocol (40 mAs, 120 kVp) before and after stent placement. The positions of the stents in the segmental bronchi were analyzed and compared with the bronchoscopic findings, which were reference standard. Patency versus lack of patency of stents was classified with five levels of confidence, and a definitive diagnosis was assigned to each stent. Prediction of stent dislodgment, follow-up findings, and complications occurring during the observation period were recorded. Consensus reading was performed by two radiologists. Statistical analysis was conducted by receiver operating characteristic analysis or four-field table., RESULTS: Seven patients underwent implantation of 37 stents (mean, 5 +/- 2 [SD] stents per patient; range, 2-8 stents). The area under the curve for differentiating patent from occluded stents was 0.995 with resulting sensitivity and specificity of 86.5% and 98.1%. The correct diagnosis of patency was established with MDCT for all but one stent (sensitivity, 94.7%; specificity, 100%). Sensitivity and specificity for prediction of dislodgment were 80% and 91%. Five stents were not identified during inspection bronchoscopy but were found in a regular position at MDCT. Three instances of minor bleeding and one of pneumothorax resolved spontaneously. The mean effective dose of the scan was 1.3 +/- 0.6 mSv., CONCLUSION: Low-dose MDCT is feasible for radiologic monitoring after airway bypass procedure.",Excluded
184,"Irradiation as a quarantine treatment for the solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis Phenacoccus solenopsis is an aggressively invasive species that targets agricultural and ornamental plants, thereby threatening the world cotton industry and other crops. P. solenopsis has been listed as a quarantine insect in Europe and China. The utilization of phytosanitary irradiation as a potential treatment for disinfesting agricultural commodities in trade has expanded rapidly in recent years. A reasonable dose of radiation to eliminate P. solenopsis needs to be determined, taking into account the side effects of radiation on agricultural products and the species-specific tolerance of the insect to radiation. We applied radiation ranging from 50 to 200. Gy to P. solenopsis to determine the optimal dose. Both the radiation dose and the developmental stage of the insect were independent variables. Higher doses of radiation or lesser mature insect stages provided more effective treatment. In nymphs, a radiation dose of 100. Gy caused extinction of the irradiated population by disrupting ovary development, while 150. Gy caused 100% mortality. In adults, all tested doses of irradiation did not affect longevity, but we were able to prevent reproduction with high (150 and 200. Gy) doses. In P. solenopsis, a 100. Gy dose of radiation could eliminate the irradiated population in two generations. The mortality curve showed a steep slope beyond 150. Gy; thus, if killing all of the insects in a shorter amount of time is necessary, 200. Gy may be a reasonable dose for the quarantine treatment of the solenopsis mealybug. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Included
2010,"Contrast harmonic imaging ultrasound and perfusion imaging for surveillance after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair regarding detection and characterization of suspected endoleaks OBJECTIVE: Is Contrast Harmonic Imaging (CHI) comparable to computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan in detecting and characterizing suspected endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair in a non-selected group including reintervention procedure and branched endografts in daily practice?, MATERIAL/METHODS: In a prospective study computed tomography angiography (CTA) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) were performed in 30 consecutive patients (26 males, 4 females, mean age: 72 years, range: 38-87) with suspected endoleaks in follow-up (mean 13 months, range: 1-95) after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair or procedure in dissection or penetrated ulcer of the aorta (25 infrarenal, 5 suprarenal stent grafts, mean aortic diameter 56 mm, range: 27-98). CTA was supposed to be gold standard for determining the presence of endoleaks (multislice CT, collimation 16 x 0.75 mm, 100 ml of iodized contrast agent bolus). Ultrasonography used a multi-frequency probe (1-4 MHz) with the modalities of colour coded Doppler sonography (CCDS), power Doppler (PD) combined with contrast enhancement and the technique of contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) and low mechanical index (MI < 0.2). 2.4 ml of SonoVue (Bracco, Altana Pharma GmbH, Italy) were administered to each patient intravenously as a bolus injection., RESULTS: Out of 30 patients, 21 endoleaks were identified in CTA (6 type I or III, 15 type II), 22 in CHI. Thus, sensitivity for CHI was therefore 99%, its specificity 85% (Spearman correlation coefficient (CC) 0.92). In follow-up the localizations of endoleak type I or III exclusively detected by CHI were confirmed as true positive by angiography. Due to its dynamic characteristic CHI seemed to be more helpful in characterization of endoleaks than CTA. In case of a rupture after reintervention a type III endoleak leads to prompt intervention before receiving the result of the CT scan. Altogether, CHI failed to identify 1 combined type I and II endoleak (sensitivity 0.99). Both, CCDS and PD were positive only in 6/30 patients (CC 0.33 and 0.39). Interestingly the application of contrast agent doubles the detection rate of endoleaks (12/30) in CCDS and PD (CC 0.39)., CONCLUSION: Contrast harmonic imaging (CHI) compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA) accurately depicts endoleaks after endovascular abdominal aneurysm repair and stent-graft procedure in dissected and ulcerated aorta. It seems to be superior in characterization of the type of endoleaks and can be established in order to reduce iodized contrast agent and radiation exposure in follow-up. In contrast to CTA scan CHI can be offered to patients with chronic renal insufficiency and allows a dynamic examination and a perfusion analysis.",Excluded
2692,"Selective brain responses to acute and chronic low-dose X-ray irradiation in males and females Radiation exposure is known to have profound effects on the brain, leading to precursor cell dysfunction and debilitating cognitive declines [Nat. Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am. J. Otolaryngol. 23 (2002) 215; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 889; Curr. Opin. Neurol. 16 (2003) 129]. Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included

Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data of 57 patients with malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Nineteen patients underwent the placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds (group A), and 38 patients underwent the placement of a bare stent (group B). The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups of patients: symptom relief rate, duration of venous patency, survival time, quality of life, and adverse events. Result(s): A total of 34 stents and 527 seeds were implanted in group A, while a total of 57 stents were implanted in group B. The surgery success rate was 96.5%, and no serious complication related to the surgery was reported. Symptoms of venous obstruction improved significantly after surgery. The score of group A decreased from 14.74 +/- 0.562 points before surgery to 2.79 +/- 1.357 points after surgery(P <.001), and the score of group B decreased from 13.79 +/- 1.398 points before surgery to 5.55 +/- 3.674 points after surgery (P <.001). The patency rate of group A was significantly higher than that of group B at 1 to 6 months after surgery (100%, 84.2%, 68.4%, 63.2%, 36.8%, 21.1% vs 68.4%, 23.7%, 18.4%, 7.9%, 5.3%, 2.6%, respectively; P <.05). Before treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score between the groups (P =.791). After 1 to 6 months of treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in group A than in group B (P =.013). The median patency duration in groups A and B was 125 days (95% CI: 80.018-169.982) and 35 days (95% CI: 20.501-49.499), respectively (P <.001). The median survival time of group A was 155 days (95% CI: 110.406-199.594), and that of group B was 98 days (95% CI: 55.712-140.288; P =.325). Multivariate analysis showed that the implantation of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds and the KPS score (>=80 points) were independent factors of long-term patency after stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds is a safe and effective treatment for venous obstruction caused by malignant tumors. This treatment provides prolonged patency compared with the placement of bare stent, and while it does not significantly improve the survival time of patients, it can improve their quality of life.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded

Radiographic follow-up of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is based on standard AP and lateral X-rays. The use of EOS TM 2D imaging system reduces patient's radiation exposure compared to conventional X-rays. However, using this system, the validity and reproducibility of angular measurements, have not been studied yet for the measurement of pelvic and acetabular parameters in patients with THA., HYPOTHESIS: The EOS TM 2D imaging system offers similar advantages to conventional X-rays in the measurement of pelvic and acetabular orientation parameters which are commonly used., PATIENTS AND METHOD: Five angular parameters characterizing pelvic tilt and acetabular cup orientation were determined using the same digital measurement Imagika TM software based on two series of standard X-rays and EOS TM 2D images acquired in both standing and sitting positions. Radiographs from 50 patients with unilateral THA were measured three times by two observers. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility using each method was independently studied then paired comparison was performed., RESULTS: The ICC and Spearman rank correlation coefficient demonstrated an excellent EOS/conventional X-ray correlation.

Twelve patients (63.2%) had an increased white blood cell count (>12k/muL) during the event. Eleven patients had an increase in temperature (.38degreeC) during this period. The etiology of these conditions included pneumonia (n = 4), atelectasis (n = 4), congestive heart failure (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2), and miscellaneous reasons (n = 4). Conclusion(s): VACs occurred in 11.7% of patients in our medical intensive care unit. The etiology of these events was diverse and did not usually reflect complications. These new CDC criteria for institutional reporting of complications during mechanical ventilation do not necessarily identify complications or provide a good method for comparing outcomes in hospitals.© Copyright by the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.",Excluded
1626,"Pulmonary lymphoma identified as a result of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer PURPOSE: To describe the frequency and findings of pulmonary lymphoma in asymptomatic people undergoing computed tomographic (CT) screening for lung cancer., METHODS: All lymphoma diagnoses resulting from CT screening of 31 567 at-risk subjects (median age, 61 years) were identified, and the CT images were reviewed to document the lesions as to number, location, density, shape, and margin. The presence of lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion was also documented., RESULTS: Five patients with pulmonary lymphoma were identified. The lymphoma was a B-cell lymphoma in three, Hodgkin's lymphoma in one, and malignant lymphoma in one; it was primary in four and secondary in one. One patient had two lesions; the other four patients each had one lesion. Four of the six lesions were a mass, and two were a nodule. Four of the lesions had irregular margins. Air bronchograms were seen in three. Growth assessment was useful in leading to decisions for biopsy., CONCLUSION: In a context of CT screening to detect lung cancer in asymptomatic volunteers, the diagnosis of pulmonary lymphoma was rare but, nevertheless, occurred in five (.016%) of 31 567 volunteers.",Excluded
3433,"Online exhaled gas measurements for radiotherapy patients by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry The present study assessed whether exhaled breath analysis using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) could screen for radiation exposure. As the intensity of proton transfer reaction reagent ion H3(16)O(+) can be calculated with the intensity of H3(18)O(+), the intensity of H3(18)O(+) was monitored to observe the stability of the PTR-MS instrument during the experiment. The PTR-MS was applied for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath from 42 radiotherapy patients and other 61 patients who had not received radiotherapy. All patients were enrolled in the local cancer hospital. In the experiment, the subjects breathe slowly to the PTR-MS through a direct inlet system without any sampling bag or tube. The breath mass spectrometric data was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis to find the characteristic ions of radiation exposure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for a combination of the characteristic ions. The PTR-MS instrument was stable as the intensity of reaction ion H3(16)O(+) was maintained in 1.1%. Through statistically analysis, we found 6 kinds of characteristic ions of radiation exposure, specifically mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 93, m/z 41, m/z 102, m/z 79, m/z 131, and m/z 143. The sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) were 78.6% and 82.0% respectively. The integrated area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869. The results in our study demonstrated the potential of the online breath tester PTR-MS as a non-invasive screening for radiation exposure. Copyright © 2016. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Included
3435,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded
2193,"High-tech facelift Recent technological advances in our specialty have made us reappraise the way we approach facial rejuvenation. Some of these technological interfaces have made it possible, in the author's experience, to improve results and to tackle difficult aesthetic problems. The purpose of this paper is to report how we combine these technological advances in an effort to improve the aesthetic outcomes. These technological advances are: laser skin resurfacing, endoscopy, newer fat grafting procedures, and new alloplastic materials for bone augmentation. Other technological advances are consultations via the Internet, computer imaging for simulation of possible outcomes, etc. Endoscopy is routinely used in our facial rejuvenative procedures, almost always for the forehead, often for the midface and less often for the neck. Fat grafting procedures using newly adapted concepts are used for the brow, glabella, tear trough deformity, cheeks, lips, chin, nasolabial folds, marionette lines, and other areas of soft tissue depressions apparent before or after the lifting procedures. This has allowed us to restore the tridimensional volume and treat the soft tissue atrophy. Patients with significant skeletal soft tissue disproportion due to aging, loss of dentition, prior trauma or congenital defects may receive one or more of the following implants: glabella, cheek, piriformis, angle of the mandible, mandibular body glove type of implant, prejawl implant, chin overlay or a glove type of implant. Our preference is for a porous polyethylene material because of its tissue ingrowth inductiveness. Individuals who have damaged skin due to solar exposure, aging, smoking, etc., may receive Ultrapulse CO2 laser resurfacing at the same operative setting (more often) or in a delayed fashion. The Versapulse laser is also needed for the treatment of some skin changes secondary to aging such as telangiectasias (Variable Pulse Green) and brown spots (Q-Switch 532). The high-tech facelift has allowed us to treat the severely damaged skin, fat atrophy, bone atrophy in many patients, at the same time that the lifting procedure is performed. This provides a more comprehensive approach to facial rejuvenation. The combination of different techniques and technologies maximizes the effectiveness and minimizes the potential side effects of each one. Scars in the forehead and scalp are avoided. Incision and fat removal in the lower eyelid are often unnecessary. It provides a more precise vertical lifting with correction of the tear trough deformity and gives a tridimensional restoration of the facial volume. The facial disharmony is treated at every level starting from the facial skeletal support to the most external envelope (skin). Over 200 patients have been treated this way with a minimal rate of complications. The high-tech facial rejuvenation has allowed us to improve the surgical results of our patients compared with previous isolated techniques. The combination of each one of the techniques require a precise understanding of the limits and benefits of each. Case examples of the different combinations will be shown.",Excluded
1662,"Bone and joint modeling from 3D ankle MRI: Feasibility and comparisonwith radiographs and 2D MRI Purpose: To evaluate feasibility of creating segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-ray) from 3D isotropic ankle MRI, assess various angular and joint space measurements on models and compare with corresponding radiographs and 2D MRI measurements, and determine differences in time consumption for performing the measurements. Material(s) and Method(s): Under HIPPAA compliance, consecutive series of 27 subjects with 3D ankle MRI isotropic data sets (0.65 mm voxel, fast spin echo, proton density weighted sequence) performed on 3 T scanners were used. Three subjects with incomplete x-ray series were excluded. Thus, a total of 24 subjects, 11 left and 13 right ankles, were included in the study, of which 8 were male and 16 females. Age ranged from 17 to 73 with mean of 46 years. Segmented joint models (bone surface reconstructed x-rays) were created on all isotropic MR data sets by one observer. Three readers independently performed various blinded angular and joint space measurements on the models, corresponding 2D MRI, and radiographs (XR) at study inception and 8 weeks later. Means and standard deviations were calculated. Paired t-tests were performed for each pair (XR vs. 2D, XR vs. 3D and 2D vs. 3D) within each parameter. P values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant and box plots were generated. Spearman correlation coefficient between measurements was performed to assess Inter-reader agreement. Interclass correlation and time difference analysis was performed. Result(s): 3D segmentation models resembling x-ray were successfully created in all cases within 20 (+/-5) minutes. Good agreement (ICC > 0.65) between all reader measurements was noted across all modalities with the exception of measuring the Talocural angle (3D, 2D, XR), talar pitch (3D), and tibibofibular clear space (2D), which showed weak to poor correlation. Time consumption was significantly greater (p < 0.05) on 2D vs 3D for all measurements except lateral clear space and medial tibiotalar concavity assessments. Time consumption was noted to be significantly greater (p < 0.05) on XR as compared to 3D for nearly half the measurements (5 of 11) for each reader. Conclusion(s): 3D bone and joint segmentation models resembling x-ray are feasible from isotropic ankle MRI data sets, which might lead to possibility of automated measurements by computer in future. While good correlation was noted between all readers, absolute measurement values were significantly different between modalities. The differences in absolute values is likely related to positioning variances (rotated x-ray mortise causing varied joint width, non-angle corrected 2D images, weight bearing vs non weight bearing, and the optimal positioning of reconstructed 3D image). Tighter collimation, a protocol variation, also limited evaluation in some cases by non-inclusion of reference points normally used with XR imaging and contributed to variance. Very good (ICC > 0.7) intrareader agreement was noted for most measurements with a few measurements showing moderate to good correlation (ICC > 0.5 to 0.65), Measurements on the 3D model of joint spaces was significantly faster when compared to 2D and generally faster than XR.",Excluded
2241,"Randomized phase II chemotherapy and radiotherapy trial for patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: long-term follow-up of RTOG 92-04 PURPOSE: The standard treatment for patients with locally advanced inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer and good prognostic factors has become combined chemotherapy (ChT) and radiotherapy (RT). However, the sequencing of the two modalities, as well as fractionation of RT, has been controversial. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Study 92-04 was a randomized Phase II study designed to evaluate further the toxicity and efficacy of 2 different strategies of chemoradiation evaluated in 2 prior RTOG Phase II studies., METHODS: Patients with Stage II or III medically inoperable or unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer, good performance status, and minimal weight loss were enrolled into a prospective randomized Phase II RTOG study. Arm 1 consisted of induction ChT (vinblastine 5 mg/m(2) i.v. bolus weekly for the first 5 weeks, and cisplatin, 100 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 29) followed by concurrent ChT/RT (cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 50, 71, and 92) during thoracic radiotherapy (63 Gy in 34 fractions during 7 weeks starting on Day 50). Arm 2 was concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT starting on Day 1 with a total dose of 69.6 Gy in 58 fractions during 6 weeks, 1.2 Gy/fraction b.i.d. ChT consisted of cisplatin, 50 mg/m(2) i.v. on Days 1 and 8, and oral VP-16, 50 mg b.i.d. for 10 days only on the days of thoracic radiotherapy repeated on Day 29., RESULTS: A total of 168 patients were entered between 1992 and 1994, and 163 patients were eligible for analysis. Eighty-one patients were treated in Arm 1 and 82 patients in Arm 2. Pretreatment characteristics, including age, gender, Karnofsky performance status, histologic features, and stage, were similar. The incidence of acute esophagitis was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 2 than among those treated in Arm 1 (p <0.0001). The incidence of acute hematologic toxicity was significantly higher among patients treated in Arm 1 (p = 0.01 for anemia and p = 0.03 for other hematologic toxicities) than among those treated in Arm 2. Analysis of late toxicity showed that chronic esophageal toxicity was significantly more frequent in Arm 2 than in Arm 1 (p = 0.003). The time to in-field progression was significantly different (p = 0.009), favoring Arm 2 compared with Arm 1 (26% vs. 45% with failure in 2 years and 30% vs. 49% with failure in 4 years, respectively). The median 2-year and overall 5-year survival rates were similar between the two arms., CONCLUSION: Concurrent ChT and hyperfractionated RT resulted in a significant prolongation of the time to in-field progression, but with higher acute and chronic esophagitis. No other significant differences were observed between the two groups. Investigation with a chemoradio-protector is under way.",Excluded
804,"Cause-of-death registers in radiation-contaminated areas of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan Since the early 1990s, information on radiation-exposed populations other than those exposed from the Chernobyl accident in 1986 has become increasingly available for international scientific research. It is essential to understand how the cohorts of exposed populations have been defined and what mechanisms can be used to study their health outcomes. Different international scientific research collaborations currently investigate four population groups chronically exposed to ionizing radiation during the late 1940s and early 1950s in the Russian Federation and in Kazakhstan. In this framework, collaborations have been established to develop cause-of-death registers in each of these four areas for future mortality follow-up purposes with the aim of studying the health effects of ionizing radiation. The emphasis of this effort is on assessing the information sources available, the mechanisms of data collection and coding, and the data quality and completeness of the information collected. One of the major challenges is the harmonization of all these aspects between the four different centers to the extent possible, taking into account that much of the actual data has been collected over many decades.",Excluded
1752,"Clinical impact of Hypofractionated carbon ion radiotherapy on locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) involving a major branch of the portal or hepatic vein is in a locally advanced stage and remains difficult to cure. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical effects of carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) in locally advanced HCC (LAHCC). Method(s): The data of 11 consecutive patients with LAHCC who received C-ion RT were analyzed. The C-ion RT doses of 52.8 Gy (relative biological effectiveness [RBE]) and 60.0 Gy (RBE) were delivered in 4 fractions for standard cases, and the 60.0 Gy dose was delivered in 12 fractions for close-to-gastrointestinal-tract cases. Survival and local control probabilities were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up duration after C-ion RT was 36.4 months. The median age at the time of registration for C-ion RT was 76 years. The median tumor size was 53 mm. The numbers of treatment-naive and recurrent HCC patients were 1 and 10, respectively. Direct invasion of the major branch of the portal vein, hepatic vein, or both portal and hepatic veins was observed in three, five, and three patients, respectively. The 3-year overall survival, local control, and progression-free survival rates were 64, 78, and 18%, respectively. No patient developed radiation-induced liver diseases or grade 3 or higher toxicities in the acute and late phases.

1644,"Three-dimensional conformal reirradiation for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer previously treated with radiation therapy Background: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of reirradiation using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in symptomatic patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer. Method(s): Between 2005 and 2012, 15 patients with locoregionally recurrent lung cancer were retreated with 3D-CRT after previously receiving thoracic radiotherapy. The median interval between the initial irradiation and reirradiation was 12 months (range, five to 41 months). The median initial radiotherapy dose was 63Gy (range, 45-70 Gy), and reirradiation doses ranged from 25.2 to 45.2Gy (median, 36Gy), with daily fractions of 1.8-4Gy (median, 2Gy). Result(s): After reirradiation, 80% of the patients experienced resolved or diminished symptoms for one or more of their symptoms, with an 83% improvement in a total of 24 symptoms. The overall tumor response rate to reirradiation was 46.7%, with progressive disease occurring in only one patient. The median overall survival (OS) time was 11 months (range, one to 27 months), and the one-year OS rate was 47%. The progression-free survival time ranged from one to 10 months (median, five months). In univariate analysis, the use of combined chemotherapy and a higher reirradiation dose showed a trend toward improved survival after reirradiation. Treatment-induced toxicity included grade 2 radiation pneumonitis in only one patient, and there were no other complications, such as radiation esophagitis or myelopathy. Conclusion(s): Reirradiation using 3D-CRT with moderate doses for locoregionally recurrent lung cancer can provide palliative benefits without severe complications to the majority of selected patients with symptoms as a result of a regrowing tumor. © 2014 Tianjin Lung Cancer Institute and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
3324,"Long-term outcomes of combined endoscopic resection and chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with submucosal invasion Background: For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with submucosal (SM) invasion, surgery is the standard treatment. Definitive chemoradiotherapy (D-CRT) is a less invasive alternative option, but sometimes results in locoregional failure. Aim(s): To examine whether endoscopic resection for primary lesion removal combined with chemoradiotherapy (ER-CRT) reduces locoregional failure rates in cases of ESCC with SM invasion. Method(s): We retrospectively compared clinical outcomes between ER-CRT and D-CRT in patients diagnosed with ESCC with SM invasion between 2003 and 2014. Twenty-one patients underwent ER-CRT based on a pathological diagnosis, and 43 patients underwent D-CRT based on a clinical diagnosis. Result(s): Locoregional failure developed in 26% of patients in the D-CRT group, and in no patients in the ER-CRT group (p < 0.01). Thus, the 5-year relapse-free survival in the ER-CRT group was significantly more favorable than that in the D-CRT group (85.1% vs 59.2%; p < 0.05), although there was no difference in overall survival (85.1% vs 79.1%) nor in cause-specific survival (90.5% vs 87.2%) between the groups. There were no instances of perforation or hemorrhage associated with ER. Conclusion(s): ER-CRT is a safe and effective treatment strategy and can be considered as a new minimally invasive treatment option for patients with ESCC with SM invasion.Copyright © 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.",Excluded
1566,"Malignant melanoma in Connecticut and Denmark The rising incidence of malignant melanoma of the skin was reviewed using data from the Connecticut Tumor Registry (1935-1974) (Eisenberg et al., 1967) and the Danish Cancer Registry (1943-1972) (Clemmesen, 1965, 1974, 1977). A total of 7,530 cases were analyzed according to age, sex and anatomic site. The total age-adjusted incidence rates were similar for these two areas, despite geographic and demographic differences. However, the most rapid changes in melanoma incidence were observed in females from Denmark and males from Connecticut. In addition, the largest increases occurred for lower-extremity lesions in Danish middle-aged women and trunk-neck melanomas in Connecticut middle-aged men. Melanoma of the face was resistant to changing incidence and occurred in an older age group than melanoma of other skin sites. In general, birth cohort analysis confirmed that changing incidence began for persons born around 1900, but the rising incidence for lower-extremity melanomas in women and trunk-neck melanomas in males began earlier. In comparing incidence for anatomic sites by correcting for surface area and melanocyte density, higher than expected rates were seen for melanoma of the face in both sexes and trunk-neck melanomas in males. The data presented supported the concept that a cumulative exposure to solar radiation may be important in the etiology of melanoma of the face, but short, intense sun exposure is probably related to melanoma in other sun-exposed areas, and that melanoma in areas other than the face is responsible for the rising incidence of this disease.",Excluded
429,"Evaluation of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D PET scanner in H2(15)O brain activation studies: dose fractionation strategies for rCBF and signal enhancing protocols We evaluated the performance of the ECAT EXACT HR+ 3-D whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scanner when employed to measure brain function using H2(15)O bolus activation protocols that are completed in single same-day data acquisition sessions. Using vibrotactile and auditory stimuli as independent activation tasks, we studied the scanner performance under different imaging conditions in five healthy volunteers. Cerebral blood flow images were acquired from each volunteer using H2(15)O bolus injections of activity varying from 5-20 mCi. One-session dose-fractionation strategies were analyzed for rCBF, standard activity-concentration, switched, and cold-bolus/switched protocols. Performance characteristics. The scanner dead time grew linearly with injected dose from 10% to 25%. Random events varied from 30% to 50% of the detected events. Random and scattered events were corrected adequately at all doses. Estimated noise-effective-count curves plateau at about 10 mCi. One-session 12-injection bolus PET activation protocols. Using an acquisition protocol that accounts for the scanner performance and the practical aspects of imaging volunteers and neurological patients in a single same-day session, we assessed the correlation between the significance of activation foci and the dose/injection used. The one-session protocol employs 12 bolus injections/subject. We present evidence suggesting that when an rCBF protocol is used, image noise is reduced significantly when the activity injected increases from 5 to 10 mCi. Increasing the dose from 10 to 15 or 20 mCi yielded further but smaller reductions. Our observations also suggest that image noise will be strongly reduced if a 20-mCi dose/injection is used when data are collected using protocols that employ long acquisition times such as a switched or a cold-bolus/switched protocol.",Excluded
381,"Molecular model T6: C60 bulk-heterojunction solar cells Organic photovoltaic devices offer a large technological potential as a renewable source of electrical energy because of their low cost and ease of processing. For the last few years, the interest in such devices has grown rapidly, allowing multiplication of the solar conversion efficiency by 5 within about 10 years. The highest conversion efficiency obtained is now close to 5% with a spin-coated polythiophene-fullerene blend. For a better understanding of those polymer blend systems, we have fabricated a coevaporated solar cell from model molecules. The molecular blend was composed of sexithiophene (, -dihexylsexithiophene, T6) as a donor and fullerene C60 as an acceptor. The influence of the T6: C60 proportion was studied for an active layer of 100 nm thickness. The conversion efficiency obtained with the optimal proportion of T6: C60 (40-60) is 0.7%. Reverse bias annealing effect was studied by measuring the current-voltage characteristics after each postprocessing step. The conversion efficiency reached 1% but still remained much less than for the polymer bulk heterojunction. This major difference may come from the spontaneous phase separation which takes place in polymers to form an interpenetrated network. 2006 American Vacuum Society.",Excluded

Method We analysed 170 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery, recorded the evolution of visual acuity and complication rates, and compared their survival with 620 patients treated with eye enucleation. Different peripheral doses (using the 50% therapeutic isodose) were employed: 50-70 Gy for 24 patients, 45 Gy for 71 patients, 35 Gy for 62 patients. Findings There was no significant difference in survival between the 35-Gy, 45-Gy and 50- to 70-Gy groups when compared between themselves (p00.168) and with the enucleation group (p00.454). The 5-year survival rates were: 64% for 35 Gy, 62.71% for 45 Gy, 63.6% for 50-70 Gy and 65.2% for enucleated patients. Clinical variables influencing survival for radiosurgery patients were tumour volume (p00.014) and location (median 66.4 vs 37.36 months for juxtapapillary vs peripheral tumours, respectively; p00.001), while age and gender did not prove significant. Regarding complications, using 35 Gy led to more than a 50% decrease, when compared with the 45-Gy dose, in the incidence of cataract, glaucoma and retinal detachment. Retinopathy, optic neuropathy and vitreous haemorrhage were not significantly influenced. Blindness decreased dramatically from 83.7% for 45 Gy to 31.4% for 35 Gy (p00.006), as well as postradiosurgery enucleation: 23.9% for 45 Gy vs 6.45% for 35 Gy (p00.018).

2793,"Seven cases of radiation-induced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma We report 7 cases of radiation-induced skin cancer. The diagnosis was based on the history of radiotherapy for benign skin diseases (5 cases) and of occupational exposures to medical doctors (2 cases). All cases were squamous cell carcinomas which arose from chronic radiodermatitis. The estimated latent period of these tumors ranged from 6 to 64 years, with an average of 29.9 years. After surgical treatments of the lesions, no local recurrences were observed in all cases. Benign skin diseases had sometimes been treated with low-energy radiation before the 1960s. Considering the estimated latent period, the peak time point of developing risk of radiation-induced skin cancer by such treatment has been already passed, however, the danger of it should not be ignored in future. In association with multiplicity of radiation usage, occupational exposure of radiation may develop the risk of occurrence of skin cancer in future. Therefore, we should recognize that radiation-induced skin cancer is not in the past. In the cases of chronic skin diseases showing warty keratotic growth, erosion and ulcer, we should include chronic radio-dermatitis in the differential diagnosis.

2556,"Quantitative Accuracy and Lesion Detectability of Low-Dose 18F-FDG PET for Lung Cancer Screening Lung cancer remains responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cancer, but recently there has been a significant shift in the clinical paradigm regarding the initial management of subjects at high risk for this disease. Low-dose CT has demonstrated significant improvements over planar x-ray screening for patient prognoses and is now performed in the United States. Specificity of this modality, however, is poor, and the additional information from PET has the potential to improve its accuracy. Routine screening requires consideration of the effective dose delivered to the patient, and this work investigates image quality of PET for low-dose conditions, in the context of lung lesion detectability. Reduced radiotracer doses were simulated by randomly discarding counts from clinical lung cancer scans acquired in list-mode. Bias and reproducibility of lesion activity values were relatively stable even at low total counts of around 5 million trues. Additionally, numeric observer models were developed and trained with the results of 2 physicians and 3 postdoctoral researchers with PET experience in a detection task; detection sensitivity of the observers was well correlated with lesion signal-to-noise ratio. The models were used prospectively to survey detectability of lung cancer lesions, and the findings suggested a lower limit around 10 million true counts for maximizing performance. Under the acquisition parameters used in this study, this translates to an effective patient dose of less than 0.4 mSv, potentially allowing a complete low-dose PET/CT lung screening scan to be obtained under 1 mSv.

1506,"Long-term results in the treatment of vitiligo with oral khellin plus UVA This study was performed to assess the effectiveness and short-term and long-term safety of oral khellin plus UVA (KUVA) in patients with vitiligo. Twenty-eight patients (13 males and 15 females; mean age, 34 years; [age range, 15-51 years]) most with extensive generalized vitiligo of more than 6 months duration had received KUVA at sometime during a 14-year period. The response to treatment (i.e. repigmentation of depigmented areas) was rated retrospectively comparing photographs taken before and after therapy and correlation analysis revealed that it was statistically significantly linked to the number of KUVA treatments (r = 0.833, P = 0.001) and to total cumulative UVA dose (r = 0.840, P = 0.001). Of 17 patients who had continued therapy for longer than 3 months, 7 (41%) had a good response (i.e., more than 70% repigmentation of lesional skin) after a mean of 194 treatments (range, 69-386 treatments) and a mean cumulative UVA dose of 2,036 J/cm2 (range, 690-4,411 J/cm2), whereas lower response grades were observed in the patients with lower treatment numbers. The most common short-term side effect was mild nausea, occurring in 8 of 28 patients (29%), and mainly in the first week(s) of treatment. Follow-up assessment at a mean of 40 months (range, 4-110 months) after the end of KUVA therapy available in 23 of 28 patients revealed no skin cancers or actinic skin damage in any patient. These data indicate that KUVA seems to be safe as well as effective for vitiligo, provided treatment is administered long enough.",Excluded
2201,"Low dose IR-induced IGF-1-sCLU expression: a p53-repressed expression cascade that interferes with TGFbeta1 signaling to confer a pro-survival bystander effect Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR <=10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (>=2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>=1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (>=10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFbeta1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFbeta1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFbeta1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing.",Included
627,"Solitary pulmonary nodule: Characterization with combined wash-in and washout features at dynamic multi-detector row CT PURPOSE: To prospectively assess the accuracy of combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast material-enhanced multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) in distinguishing benign from malignant solitary pulmonary nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained. The study included 107 patients (62 men, 45 women; mean age, 55 years; range, 22-81 years) with a solitary pulmonary nodule. After unenhanced CT (2.5-mm collimation) scans were obtained, dynamic CT was performed by using a helical technique (series of images obtained throughout the nodule, with 2.5-mm collimation, at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds and 4, 5, 9, 12, and 15 minutes) after intravenous injection of contrast medium (120 mL). Tissue diagnosis was made in 70 nodules, and follow-up images showed benignancy in the remaining 37 (no change in size, n = 32; decrease in size, n = 5). CT findings were analyzed in terms of wash-in and washout of contrast medium. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignant nodules were calculated by considering both the wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic CT. RESULT(S): There were 49 malignant and 58 benign nodules. When diagnostic criteria for malignancy of both wash-in of 25 HU or greater and washout of 5-31 HU were applied, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy were 94% (46 of 49 nodules), 90% (52 of 58 nodules), and 92% (98 of 107 nodules), respectively. Of 58 benign nodules, 27 showed less than 25 HU wash-in, 14 showed persistent contrast enhancement without washout and with wash-in of 25 HU or greater, and 11 showed washout greater than 31 HU and wash-in of 25 HU or greater. CONCLUSION(S): Evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules by analyzing combined wash-in and washout characteristics at dynamic contrast-enhanced multi-detector row CT showed 92% accuracy for distinguishing benign nodules from malignant nodules. © RSNA, 2005.",Excluded

Method(s): Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field. Result(s): The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded. The pattern of recurrence was as follows: in-field, 2 cases (7%); marginal, 8 cases (28%); out-field, 11 cases (38%); no recurrence on radiologic findings, 6 cases (21%); and uncertain, 2 cases (7%). Conclusion(s): SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival duration more than Bv treatment and provides good local control in patients with recurrent HGGs, especially those with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

2508,"Long-term outcome, relapse patterns, and toxicity after radiotherapy for orbital mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: Implications for radiotherapy optimization Objectives: Although mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) is sensitive to radiation therapy (RT), the optimal RT dose and treatment volumes have not been established. This study aimed to assess the relapse patterns and outcomes of patients with orbital MALToma who underwent RT and to suggest implications for optimized RT. Method(s): We reviewed 212 patients (246 orbits) diagnosed with orbital MALToma who received RT between 1993 and 2013. Median RT dose was 25.2 Gy. Generally, conjunctival and eyelid lesions were irradiated with electrons, whereas retrobulbar and lacrimal gland lesions with photons. Lens shielding was used for 70% of treated eyes, mainly conjunctival and eyelid tumors. Result(s): Relapse occurred in 29 patients. Among 11 patients with local relapse (LR), 4 were attributed to insufficient dose (n = 2) and improper RT volume (n = 2). The 10-year LR, contralateral orbit relapse, and distant relapse rates were 8.6%, 12.8% and 4.9%, respectively. Twelve patients died of disease-specific causes (n = 1) and intercurrent diseases (n = 11). The 10-year relapse-free survival, overall survival, and cause-specific survival rates were 69.7%, 88.2% and 98.8%, respectively. Grade 3 cataracts and nasolacrimal duct obstruction were observed in 27 and 4 orbits, respectively. Conclusion(s): Low-dose RT with proper lens shielding is an appropriate treatment for orbital MALToma in terms of high disease control rate and acceptable morbidity. However, lower RT dose may be attempted to further reduce toxicity while maintaining excellent outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
1953,"A Prospective Study of Distal Microscopic Spread in Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation in Pinned and Unpinned Specimen The most important margin in determining the prognosis of rectal cancer is circumferential resection margin (CRM). But, the type of surgery is determined by distal rectal margin (DRM), whether sphincter saving procedure is possible or patient needs an abdominoperineal resection. There are no standardized uniform guidelines for measurement of DRM. The purpose of this study is to assess the distal microscopic spread beyond gross margin after neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) in rectal cancers, the factors influencing the distal microscopic spread, the shrinkage of the distal margin in pinned and unpinned fresh and fixed specimen, and to find out the best method of measurement of distal rectal margin. A prospective analytical study was conducted from May 2013 through February 2015 in 47 cases of carcinoma rectum (both AR and APR) who had received neoadjuvant CCRT. Fresh specimen was collected within 30 min of specimen retrieval and a longitudinal cut was made in the distal margin of all specimens. One side of the specimen was pinned onto a cork board and the other side was left unpinned. Measurements were made from the distal end of clinical gross tumor. DRM was determined in both pinned and unpinned sides in fresh and fixed specimen. Of the 47 patients, 2 patients (4.2%) had small focus of tumor beyond gross margins, 1 at 6 mm and another at 3.5 mm on the unpinned side. The average margin for fresh and fixed pinned specimens was 3.67 and 3.47 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 5.4% for the pinned specimens. The average margin for fresh and fixed unpinned specimens was 3.32 and 2.84 cm, respectively, with percentage shrinkage of 14.4% for the unpinned specimens. Six patients (12.7%) had complete pathological response. Correlation of distal margin was better in pinned specimen. A correction factor of 15% for shrinkage needs to be taken into account while assessing unpinned specimen. Only in 4.2% of patients, there was distal submucosal spread beyond gross margin. Long-term follow up is required for assessing adequacy of DRM post neoadjuvant CCRT.Copyright © 2017, Indian Association of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
2988,"Balloon kyphoplasty under three-dimensional radiography guidance Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PBKP) is generally performed under two-dimensional (2D) radiography guidance (lateral- and anteroposterior (A-P) views) using C-arm fluoroscopy. However, 2D images taken by single-plane or bi-plane fluoroscopy cannot provide information regarding axial views, particularly the Z axis. Lack of information regarding the Z axis prevents the creation of three-dimensional (3D) images. Currently, there has been a progress in interventional X-ray systems, and they are capable of providing 3D radiographic images using a rotational angiography mode which is used to create 3D angiographies. In this report, we described the usefulness of 3D radiography guidance. Patients treated by PBKP was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 3D radiography guidance. These patients experienced osteoporotic vertebral fractures with severe pain. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PBKP from February to December 2016. All patients had a single-level vertebral fracture and underwent surgery by 2D or 3D radiography guidance. We performed 16 patients in 3D radiography guidance, and 10 patients in traditional 2D radiography guidance. This 3D radiography guided PBKP increase the amount of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injection compared with ordinary 2D method. As a result, postoperative vertebral height and alignment were significantly improved. Both groups have no complication. To confirm the final results and make PBKP more effective, 3D radiography guidance is feasible and safe for balloon kyphoplasty.Copyright © 2017 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded

Patients in the CAIR group received radiotherapy (RT) with 2 Gy/fraction per day at 7 d/wk with a total dose of 50-70 Gy (average dose 64.2 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 3.6-5.0 wk (average 4.6 wk). RT in the CR group was 2 Gy/fraction per day at 5 d/wk with a total dose of 40-70 Gy (average dose 61.7 Gy). The overall time of irradiation was 4.0-7.0 wk (average 6.4 wk)., RESULTS: The data showed that the immediate tumor response to RT was better in the CAIR group than in the CR group. Efficiency rates (CR plus PR) were 82.8% (24/29) and 58.6% (17/29), respectively (P = 0.047). In both groups the incidences of esophagitis and tracheitis were insignificant (P = 0.376, 0.959), and no patient received toxicity that could not be tolerated., CONCLUSION: CAIR shortens overall treatment time and is well tolerated by patients. It may be superior to CR in enhancing the local response of tumor, but its remote effect for esophageal carcinoma awaits further follow-up.",Excluded

2537,"Lifetime cancer risks from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments PURPOSE: Interventional medical radiation workers represent an under-studied population worldwide, although they receive relatively high occupational radiation doses. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cancer risk from occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. METHOD(S): A field survey of interventional medical workers in nationwide branches of the Korean Society of Interventional Radiology was conducted in 2017. Organ-specific radiation doses were estimated using national dose registry data and conversion coefficients provided by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. Lifetime attributable risk (LAR) and lifetime fractional risk (LFR) were calculated based on realistic exposure scenarios using a radiation risk assessment tool. RESULT(S): LARs from occupational radiation exposure until the age of retirement for all cancers combined were 338 (90.3-796.1), 121 (33.5-288.7), and 156 (41.1-390.6) per 100,000 individuals for male radiologists, male radiologic technologists, and female nurses, respectively. LFR for all cancers combined ranged from 0.22% (0.06-0.53) to 0.63% (0.17-1.47). Regarding the organ site, the highest LAR and LFR among all groups were observed for thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides timely evidence of potential cancer burden from the current levels of occupational radiation exposure among workers at interventional radiology departments. The risks varied by occupational groups, and workers, particularly interventional radiologists, need to be carefully monitored for radiation.",Included

Late results of a pilot study BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has recently been proven that postoperative radiotherapy combined with fluorouracil showed an increase of survival and local control in patients with rectal cancer. However, hematological and intestinal toxicity also increased. Experimental and clinical studies showed an increased radiation effect with an acceptable toxicity by delivering drug via a continuous intravenous infusion., METHODOLOGY: From 1988 to 1998, 80 patients radically operated on for stages B2-C rectal cancer were irradiated with 3 fractions of 100 cGy per day to a total dose of 5,600 cGy. 34 out of these 80 patients underwent postoperative radiotherapy alone and 46 received radiotherapy combined with concomitant protracted infusion of fluorouracil at doses of 250 mg/m2 per day., RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 54 months, the 5-year overall and disease-free survival were 59% and 54%, respectively, in the combined modality group, as compared to 42% and 34%, respectively, in the radiation alone group. The differences were not significant, but the incidence of local relapse and patients' survival showed a better trend for combined approach., CONCLUSIONS: The data from international literature are in favor of a combined approach, both in preoperative and postoperative treatment of advanced rectal cancer.

2526,"Ionizing radiation and genetic risks. VI. Chronic multifactorial diseases: a review of epidemiological and genetical aspects of coronary heart disease, essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus This paper provides a broad overview of the epidemiological and genetical aspects of common multifactorial diseases in man with focus on three well-studied ones, namely, coronary heart disease (CHD), essential hypertension (EHYT) and diabetes mellitus (DM). In contrast to mendelian diseases, for which a mutant gene either in the heterozygous or homozygous condition is generally sufficient to cause disease, for most multifactorial diseases, the concepts of genetic susceptibility' and risk factors' are more appropriate. For these diseases, genetic susceptibility is heterogeneous. The well-studied diseases such as CHD permit one to conceptualize the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype for chronic multifactorial diseases in general, namely that allelic variations in genes, through their products interacting with environmental factors, contribute to the quantitative variability of biological risk factor traits and thus ultimately to disease outcome. Two types of such allelic variations can be distinguished, namely those in genes whose mutant alleles have (i) small to moderate effects on the risk factor trait, are common in the population (polymorphic alleles) and therefore contribute substantially to the variability of biological risk factor traits and (ii) profound effects, are rare in the population and therefore contribute far less to the variability of biological risk factor traits. For all the three diseases considered in this review, a positive family history is a strong risk factor. CHD is one of the major contributors to mortality in most industrialized countries. Evidence from epidemiological studies, clinical correlations, genetic hyperlipidaemias etc., indicate that lipids play a key role in the pathogenesis of CHD. The known lipid-related risk factors include: high levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol, low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, high apoB levels (the major protein fraction of the low density lipoprotein particles) and elevated levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein. Among the risk factors which are not related to lipids are: high levels of homocysteine, low activity of paraoxonase and possibly also elevated plasma fibrinogen levels. In addition to the above, hypertension, diabetes and obesity (which themselves have genetic determinants) are important risk factors for CHD. Among the environmental risk factors are: high dietary fat intake, smoking, stress, lack of exercise etc. About 60% of the variability of the plasma cholesterol is genetic in origin. While a few genes have been identified whose mutant alleles have large effects on this trait (e.g., LDLR, familial defective apoB-100), variability in cholesterol levels among individuals in most families is influenced by allelic variation in many genes (polymorphisms) as well as environmental exposures. A proportion of this variation can be accounted for by two alleles of the apoE locus that increase (&epsi;4) and decrease (&epsi;2) cholesterol levels, respectively. A polymorphism at the apoB gene (XbaI) also has similar effects, but is probably not mediated through lipids. High density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are genetically influenced and are related to apoA1 and hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene functions. Mutations in the apoA1 gene are rare and there are data which suggest a role of allelic variation at or linked LIPC gene in high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Polymorphism at the apoA1--C3 loci is often associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The apo(a) gene which codes for Lp(a) is highly polymorphic, each allele determining a specific number of multiple tandem repeats of a unique coding sequence known as Kringle 4. The size of the gene correlates with the size of the Lp(a) protein. The smaller the size of the Lp(a) protein, the higher are the Lp(a) levels. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",Excluded

These neurological features resemble those of ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), but in AOA there are none of the extraneurological features of AT, such as immunodeficiency, neoplasia, chromosomal instability, or sensitivity to ionizing radiation. It is unclear whether these patients have a true disorder of chromosomal instability or a primary neurodegenerative syndrome, and it has not been possible to identify the defective gene in AOA, since the families have been too small for linkage analysis. We have identified a new family with AOA, and we show that the patients have no evidence of chromosomal instability or sensitivity to ionizing radiation, suggesting that AOA in this family is a true primary cerebellar ataxia. We have localized the disease gene, by linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping, to a 15.9-cM interval on chromosome 9q34.

288,"Patient effective radiation dose and associated risk from transmission scans using 153Gd line sources in cardiac SPECT studies The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of transmission measurements acquisition to total patient effective dose from cardiac SPECT studies. A dual-head L-shaped gamma camera equipped with a transmission scan acquisition system based on two 153Gd line sources was used to simulate transmission measurements acquisition exposure on an anthropomorphic phantom. Thermoluminescence dosimeters were used to directly monitor the dose to 550 measuring points in the phantom. The effective dose and associated risk from transmission scans acquisition were estimated and compared to those associated to the radiopharmaceutical injected. The maximum effective dose from a typical transmission measurements acquisition was 1.3 muSv and 1.9 muSv for male and female patients, respectively. The contribution of the typical transmission scans acquisition to total patient radiation risk from a cardiac SPECT study is less than 10-3. Thus, radiation exposure may not be considered as a limiting factor for the clinical application of attenuation correction methods based on transmission measurements in cardiac SPECT.",Excluded

In addition, the effects of exogenous glutathione (GSH) against radiation injury in rat livers were investigated. We found that MDA levels have an age-associated increment and an increasing radiation dose-related elevation, although they decrease slightly in the 4 Gy group. The MDA levels in old rats were lower in males than in females, while those of young rats did not change. There were no observed age-related changes in SOD activities, although male rats had higher SOD activity than females. Female rats had the highest CAT activities in the 4 Gy group, while male rats had the highest CAT activities in the 6 Gy group. CAT activities in the 8 Gy group were lower than those of the 2 Gy group for each gender and age. While MDA levels were decreased and CAT activities increased by GSH, SOD activities remained unchanged. The results indicate that gamma-ray radiation affects gender- and age-dependent MDA levels, SOD and CAT activities. Administration of GSH appears to be a useful approach to reduce radiation injury by reducing MDA levels and increasing CAT activities.",Included
2613,"Severe radiation-induced liver disease following localized radiation therapy for biliopancreatic carcinoma: activation of hepatic stellate cells as an early event Radiation-induced liver disease is recorded as a form of veno-occlusive disease. Its pathogenesis remains unclear even if the initial injury likely occurs in the endothelial cells of central veins. The aim of our study was to investigate liver morphological features in relation to alpha-isoform of smooth muscle actin expression in hepatic stellate cells in six patients treated by localized radiotherapy on the biliopancreatic area. Within the month after completion of treatment, an activation of hepatic stellate cells strictly confined to irradiated areas and coinciding with congestive changes was observed. At a later stage, collagen deposition gradually increased, replacing the congestive and destroyed areas. This new fibrotic tissue also contained numerous alpha-smooth muscle positive cells. Our data suggest that early hepatic stellate cells activation coinciding with congestive changes plays an important role in radiation liver injury and ensuing fibrosis.",Included
336,"Dose escalation via brachytherapy boost for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy and combined chemotherapy To investigate if dose escalation using intracavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) improves local control for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the era of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemoradiation treatment (CCRT). We retrospectively analyzed 232 patients with Stage T1-3 N0-3 M0 NPC who underwent definitive IMRT with or without additional ICBT boost between 2002 and 2013. For most of the 124 patients who had ICBT boost, the additional brachytherapy was given as 6 Gy in 2 fractions completed within 1 week after IMRT of 70 Gy. CCRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy was used for 176 patients, including 88 with and 88 without ICBT boost, respectively. The mean follow-up time was 63.1 months. The 5-year overall survival and local control rates were 81.5% and 91.5%, respectively. ICBT was not associated with local control prediction (P = 0.228). However, in a subgroup analysis, 75 T1 patients with ICBT boost had significantly better local control than the other 71 T1 patients without ICBT boost (98.1% vs 85.9%, P = 0.020), despite having fewer patients who had undergone chemotherapy (60.0% vs 76.1%, P = 0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that both ICBT (P = 0.029) and chemotherapy (P = 0.047) influenced local control for T1 patients. Our study demonstrated that dose escalation with ICBT can improve local control of the primary tumor for NPC patients with T1 disease treated with IMRT, even without chemotherapy.

2770,"Ionizing radiation accelerates the development of atherosclerotic lesions in ApoE-/- mice and predisposes to an inflammatory plaque phenotype prone to hemorrhage After radiotherapy treatment, there is an increased incidence of localized atherosclerosis in patients with Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer. Here, we established a mouse model to study the development and progression of radiation-induced atherosclerosis and to compare the phenotype of these lesions with age-related atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis-prone ApoE-/- mice fed a regular chow diet received single radiation doses of 14 Gy or sham treatments (0 Gy) to the neck, including both carotid arteries. At 22, 28, and 34 weeks after irradiation, blood samples were taken, and the arterial tree was removed for histological examination. Cholesterol levels in irradiated mice were not significantly different from age-matched controls, and markers of systemic inflammation (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and C-reactive protein) were not elevated. The lesions in irradiated arteries were macrophage rich, with a remarkable influx of inflammatory cells, predominantly granulocytes. Intraplaque hemorrhage and erythrocyte-containing macrophages were seen only in lesions of irradiated arteries. Based on these data, we propose that irradiation accelerates the development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intraplaque hemorrhage.",Included
1668,"Image quality of iterative reconstruction in cranial CT imaging: comparison of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR) Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare cranial CT (CCT) image quality (IQ) of the MBIR algorithm with standard iterative reconstruction (ASiR)., Methods: In this institutional review board (IRB)-approved study, raw data sets of 100 unenhanced CCT examinations (120 kV, 50-260 mAs, 20 mm collimation, 0.984 pitch) were reconstructed with both ASiR and MBIR. Signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) were calculated from attenuation values measured in caudate nucleus, frontal white matter, anterior ventricle horn, fourth ventricle, and pons. Two radiologists, who were blinded to the reconstruction algorithms, evaluated anonymized multiplanar reformations of 2.5 mm with respect to depiction of different parenchymal structures and impact of artefacts on IQ with a five-point scale (0: unacceptable, 1: less than average, 2: average, 3: above average, 4: excellent)., Results: MBIR decreased artefacts more effectively than ASiR (p < 0.01). The median depiction score for MBIR was 3, whereas the median value for ASiR was 2 (p < 0.01). SNR and CNR were significantly higher in MBIR than ASiR (p < 0.01)., Conclusions: MBIR showed significant improvement of IQ parameters compared to ASiR. As CCT is an examination that is frequently required, the use of MBIR may allow for substantial reduction of radiation exposure caused by medical diagnostics.Copyright © 2014, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
207,"Effects of curcumin based PDT on the viability and the organization of actin in melanotic (A375) and amelanotic melanoma (C32) - in vitro studies Curcumin is a turmeric, antioxidative compound, well-known of its anti-cancer properties. Nowadays more and more effort is made in the field of enhancing the efficiency of the anticancer therapies. Combining the photoactive properties of curcumin with the superficial localization of melanoma and photodynamic therapy (PDT) seems to be a promising treatment method. The research focused on the evaluation of the curcumin effectiveness as an anticancer therapeutic agent in the in vitro treatment of melanotic (A375) and amelanotic (C32) melanoma cell lines. Keratinocytes (HaCat) and fibroblasts (HGF) were used to assess the impact of the therapy on the skin tissue. The aim of the study was to investigate the cell death after exposure to light irradiation after preincubation with curcumin. Additionaly the authors analized the interactions between curcumin and the actin cytoskeleton. The cytotoxic effect initiated by curcumin and increased by irradiation confirm the usefulness of the flavonoid in the PDT approach. Depending on curcumin concentration and incubation time, melanoma cells survival rate ranged from: 93.68 % (C32 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) and 83.47 % (A375 cell line, 10 muM, 24 h) to 8.98 % (C32 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h) and 12.42 % (A375 cell line, 50 muM, 48 h). Moreover, photodynamic therapy with curcumin increased the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells in comparison to incubation with curcumin without irradiation. The study demonstrated that PDT induced caspase-3 overexpression and DNA cleavage in the studied cell lines. The cells revealed decreased proliferation after the therapy due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Although effective, the therapy remains not selective towards melanoma cells.

3195,"Long-term visual acuity outcomes in patients with uveal melanoma treated with 125I episcleral OSU-Nag plaque brachytherapy PURPOSE: To report our experience in long-term follow-up of ocular melanoma patients treated with custom OSU-Nag eye plaques using (125)I sources., METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted for 113 consecutive ocular melanoma patients with follow-up visual acuity data who were treated with OSU-Nag plaque episcleral brachytherapy at The Ohio State University Medical Center from 1994 to 2009. Visual acuity, complication data, and recurrence rates were recorded up to 120 months after brachytherapy., RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 63.0 years (range, 22-93). Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range, 2-180). Median radiation dose at the prescription point was 85.8 Gy (range, 51.8-103.7). Preservation of useful visual acuity, defined as better than 20/200, was noted in 43 of 74 (58%) of patients in the present study at 36 months compared with 50.1% of Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study participants. By 120 months, 17 of 30 (57%; 95% confidence interval, 45-69%) progressed to visual acuity worse than 20/200, whereas 9 of 30 (30%) retained visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 4 of 30 (13%) were 20/50-20/200. The rate of retinopathy after radiation was approximately 40% of all those observed by 60 months. Baseline visual acuity, apical tumor height, American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor category, and distance between the tumor and the fovea were all significantly associated with loss of visual acuity. The local tumor control rate by 60 months of follow-up was 93% (95% confidence interval, 85-97%)., CONCLUSIONS: The OSU-Nag custom (125)I plaque is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma, with preservation of useful visual acuity in 58% of eyes 3 years after treatment and 43% of eyes 10 years after treatment.

314,"Mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea, 1996-2015 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk for all-cause and cause-specific mortality in diagnostic medical radiation workers in South Korea., METHODS: The study population included all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the National Dosimetry Registry (NDR) between 1996 and 2011. NDR data were linked with mortality data obtained from national registries through 2015. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and relative standardised mortality ratios (rSMRs) were calculated for external comparison and for adjustment of the cohort's overall healthiness., RESULTS: A total of 1099 deaths (974 in men and 125 in women) were reported from among 80 837 medical radiation workers. The SMRs for all causes of death were significantly lower than expected in both men (SMR 0.45, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.48) and women (SMR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.58). No excesses were observed for any specific cause of death. The findings were similar by job title, calendar year of entry and year of birth. However, relative to all causes of death, mortality from all cancers (rSMR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82), leukaemia, colon cancer, stomach cancer and diseases of the circulatory system increased significantly among male workers. The results for female workers were limited due to small number of deaths; however, the rSMR for all cancers was significantly elevated (rSMR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.46)., CONCLUSIONS: This cohort showed lower mortality among diagnostic medical radiation workers than in the general population. However, occupational factors may have been involved in the increased relative mortality for several causes of death. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. No commercial re-use.

2669,"Genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomas and K-ras gene mutation in mice after exposure to X-rays and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea PURPOSE: Ras activation is one of the major mechanisms for the development of murine thymic lymphomas by radiation and chemical carcinogens. To gain insight into the relationship between genetic susceptibility and ras gene mutation, the frequency and spectrum of ras gene mutation was examined in thymic lymphomas from susceptible and resistant mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: K- and N-ras mutations in thymic lymphomas that arose in X-ray-irradiated and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice of susceptible C57BL/6, rather resistant C3H and their hybrid B6C3F1 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing., RESULTS: C57BL/6 exhibited a higher incidence of thymic lymphomas after exposure to X-rays and ENU than C3H, with B6C3F1 being intermediate. K-ras gene mutations occurred frequently in the pathogenesis of ENU-induced thymic lymphomas in susceptible C57BL/6 as opposed to resistant C3H. The ras mutations were more frequent in ENU-induced thymic lymphomas than X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, and with the latter, there was no clear evidence for strain differences, suggesting that the genetic susceptibility to X-rays was independent of ras activation. The mutations of K-ras in thymic lymphomas from C57BL/6 were predominantly GGT to GAT in codon 12, whereas this mutation type was never found in those from C3H. No strain difference was observed in the nucleotide sequence or expression levels of O(6)-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, indicating that this enzyme did not account for the genetic susceptibility to ras activation., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a clear strain and carcinogen dependency of K-ras mutation and that the frequency of ras mutation might determine the genetic susceptibility to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis, whereas pathways independent of ras activation might determine the susceptibility to X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis.",Included

2799,"Higher levels of metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein levels are associated with less favourable treatment response to disease modifying antirheumatic drugs in female patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis Background Metastasis-inducing S100A4 protein was identified as a pro-inflammatory and pro-destructive factor in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our research group has previously demonstrated that S100A4 is significantly elevated in peripheral blood, synovial fluid and synovial tissue of RA patients and that the levels of S100A4 correlate with disease activity. Objectives To evaluate the levels of S100A4 in serum of patients with recent-onset RA and to characterize the association of S100A4 with disease activity and response to treatment. Methods Serum levels of S100A4 protein were measured by ELISA in 59 patients with recent-onset RA (symptom duration <6 months) before and 3 months after initiation of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, and cross-sectionally in 42 healthy controls. IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were analysed at baseline. Clinical disease activity (DAS28) was assessed at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after initiation of treatment. The degree of radiographic joint damage was calculated from x-rays using the Sharp-van der Heijde Score (SHS) at baseline and at month 12. Results Mean DAS28 (SD) significantly decreased from 5.36 (1.42) at baseline to 3.09 (1.52) at month 3 (n=59) and to 2.69 (1.19) at month 12 (n=40), respectively (p<0.0001). Of the 40 patients with available radiographs, 9 (23%) showed an increase in SHS (SHS >0) after 12 months. The levels of serum S100A4 protein were significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy controls (646.60+/-602.60 vs. 46.97+/-30.12 ng/ml; p<0.001) and significantly decreased after 3 months of treatment (to 388.10+/-521.00; p<0.001). There was positive correlation of baseline levels of S100A4 with IgM-RF (r=0.611; p<0.0001) and ACPA levels (r=0.471; p<0.001). After adjustment for IgM-RF, the levels of S100A4 at baseline (r=0.403; p<0.05) as well as at month 3 (r=0.548; p<0.01) were positively correlated with DAS28 after 12 months of treatment in female patients (n=28). There was no correlation in male patients. The levels of S100A4 did not correlate with disease activity at baseline or with the change of disease activity over time. Furthermore, there was no association between baseline levels or changes of SA100A4 and achievement of DAS28 remission or radiographic progression. Conclusions Our results indicate that circulating S100A4 levels are significantly higher in patients with recent-onset RA compared to healthy individuals and that higher S100A4 levels at baseline or at month 3 might have predictive potential for worse treatment response at month 12, at least in female patients with recent-onset RA.",Excluded

Out of 30 patients who underwent RHC for soft tissue sarcoma at our Institution, 6 were enrolled into this study to undergo a second-look operation for unplanned excision. Radiotherapy was given to a total dose of 32 Gy. Hyperthermia was conducted once a week, for a total of five sessions. Chemotherapy was performed at weekly intervals. Surgery was performed to excise the scar tissue that was enhanced on preoperative MRI. In all six cases, no residual tumors were identified in resected scar tissue; thus, no additional wide excision was performed. The average follow-up period was 10.9 years. There were no local recurrences, and all patients were alive at their final follow-up. Long-term followup confirmed that RHC can replace additional wide excision for unplanned excision of soft tissue sarcoma.",Excluded
2214,"Long-term pain outcomes for recurrent idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia after stereotactic radiosurgery: A prospective comparison of first-time microvascular decompression and repeat stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Microvascular decompression (MVD) and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) are common surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Many patients who receive SRS have pain recurrence; the ideal second intervention is unknown. The authors directly compared pain outcomes after MVD and repeat SRS in a population of patients in whom SRS failed as their first-line procedure for TN, and they identified predictors of pain control. METHODS The authors reviewed a prospectively collected database of patients undergoing surgery for TN between 1997 and 2014 at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Standardized data collection focused on preoperative clinical characteristics, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes. Patients with typical type 1, idiopathic TN with >= 1 year of follow-up were included. RESULTS In total, 168 patients underwent SRS as their first procedure. Of these patients, 90 had residual or recurrent pain. Thirty of these patients underwent a second procedure at UCSF and had >= 1 year of follow-up; 15 underwent first-time MVD and 15 underwent repeat SRS. Patients undergoing MVD were younger than those receiving repeat SRS and were more likely to receive >= 80 Gy during the initial SRS. The average follow-up was 44.9 +/- 33.6 months for MVD and 48.3 +/- 45.3 months for SRS. All patients achieved complete pain freedom without medication at some point during their follow-up. At last follow-up, 80% of MVD-treated patients and 33.3% of SRS-treated patients had a favorable outcome, defined as Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity scores of I-IIIa (p < 0.05). Percentages of patients with favorable outcome at 1 and 5 years were 86% and 75% for the MVD cohort and 73% and 27% for the SRS cohort, respectively (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis demonstrated that performing MVD was statistically significantly associated with favorable outcome (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.60, p < 0.01). There were no statistically significant predictors of favorable outcome in the MVD cohort; however, the presence of sensory changes after repeat SRS was associated with pain relief (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Patients who received MVD after failed SRS had a longer duration of favorable outcome compared to those who received repeat SRS; however, both modalities are safe and effective. The presence of post-SRS sensory changes was predictive of a favorable pain outcome in the SRS cohort.Copyright ©AANS 2019.",Excluded
3231,"A mice radiation-induced liver disease model for stereotactic body radiation therapy validated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses resulting in radiation-induced liver diseases (RILD) and dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice, which are still undefined in HCC SBRT. Materials/Methods: This study was consisted of 2 phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. Pathological differences, signs, such as mouse performance status (MPS), and serum aspartate/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in human, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiation therapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in mice study. Result(s): Evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiation therapy relating signs were as follows: MPS >=2.0+/-0.52, AST/ALT >=589.2+/-118.5/137.4+/-15.3 U/L, serum albumin <=16.8+/-2.29 g/L. Preliminary dose constraints of OARs had also been obtained, such as livers: average dose <=26.36+/-1.71 Gy and gastrointestinal tract: maximum dose <=22.63 Gy. Mouse RILD models could be developed when livers were irradiated with the average doses >=31.76+/-1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice had also been validated in HCC patients. Conclusion(s): Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for OARs and evaluation criteria of mice liver radiation therapy relating signs, which will favor the study of further approaches of treating HCC with SBRT.",Excluded
1899,"Self-awareness of computed tomography ordering in the emergency department OBJECTIVES: Physician variation in the use of computed tomography (CT) is concerning due to the risks of ionizing radiation, cost, and downstream effects of unnecessary testing. The objectives of this study were to describe variation in CT-ordering rates among emergency physicians (EPs), to measure correlation between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates, to assess attitudes that influence decisions to order imaging tests, and to identify EP attitudes associated with higher CT utilization., METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of imaging and administrative billing records at two emergency department sites of a tertiary care adult teaching hospital. The study also included a cross-sectional survey of EPs at this hospital. We asked physicians about their perceived ordering behaviour, and what factors influenced their decision to order a CT. We examined correlations between perceived and actual CT-ordering rates. We adjusted ordering rates for shift distribution using a logistic regression model and identified outlier physicians whose ordering rate was significantly lower or higher than expected. We used multivariable regression analysis to determine which survey responses predicted higher CT utilization., RESULTS: During the study period, 59 EPs saw 45,854 patients, and ordered 6,609 CTs - a mean ordering rate of 14.4% (standard deviation (SD)=4.3%). The ordering rate for individual physicians ranged from 5.9% to 25.9%. Of the 59 EPs, 13 EPs were low-ordering outliers; 12 were high-ordering outliers. Forty-five EPs (76.3%) completed the survey. Mean perceived ordering rate was 12.6%, and was weakly correlated with actual ordering (r=0.19, p=0.21). 42 EPs (93.3%) believed they ordered ""about the same"" or ""fewer"" CTs than their peers. Of the 17 EPs in the two highest ordering quintiles, only 3 (18%) knew they were high orderers. In the multivariable analysis, higher ordering was associated with increasing strength of response to the following predictors: medico-legal risk (relative risk [RR]=1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.21), risk of contrast (RR=1.14, 95% CI: 1.07-1.22), what colleagues would do (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 0.99-1.19), risk of missing a diagnosis (RR=1.08, 95% CI: 0.98-1.21), and patient wishes (RR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.97-1.17)., CONCLUSIONS: There is large variation in CT ordering among EPs. Physicians' self-reported ordering rate correlates poorly with actual ordering. High CT orderers were rarely aware that they ordered more than their colleagues. Higher rates of ordering were observed among physicians who reported increased concern with 1) risk of missing a diagnosis, 2) medico-legal risk, 3) risk of contrast, 4) patient wishes, and 5) what colleagues would do.",Excluded

In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n = 17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n = 26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30 min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30 min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

Urine samples provided by workers are tested directly to analyze the tritium concentrations and estimate internal exposure dose. Since 2004, an average of approximately 1600 workers have been monitored annually, with an average annual monitoring frequency of approximately 11 000. Since 2004, the average annual collective dose of tritium internal exposure was 149.62 person.mSv, accounting for 19.07% of the total annual collective dose. A total of 18 workers' annual individual internal tritium radiation doses exceeded 2 mSv, of which 5 workers' internal tritium radiation doses in a single intake exceeded 2 mSv. The occupational population with the largest total internal tritium radiation doses consists of maintenance personnel, fuel operators, and radiation protection personnel, whose collective doses of internal exposure account for 75.51% of the total collective doses within the plant.

2016,"Rationale and design of the Japan molecular epidemiology for lung cancer study We present the rationale for the Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study designed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in smokers and never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. This prospective, ongoing, multicenter study is being conducted nationwide in Japan. Although there is no doubt that active smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, the contribution of other possible factors, including environmental tobacco or wood smoke, human papilloma virus, radon, occupational exposures, and genetic susceptibility, is highly likely, based on studies of never-smokers with non-small-cell lung cancer. Because of the predominance of women in the never-smoker subgroup, the role of female hormones in lung cancer development has also been considered. We hypothesize that driver mutations, which are critical for the development of lung cancer, are triggered by the environmental factors with or without the influence of the hormone. The SWOG-led intergroup molecular epidemiology study S0424 was conducted to focus on these issues by using a detailed questionnaire and specimen collection in statistically significant cohorts of smokers and never-smokers from both sexes. The Japan Molecular Epidemiology for Lung Cancer study follows and extends the S0424 molecular epidemiology concept in principle by using a similar approach that will facilitate future comparisons between the studies but with a greater focus on more recently defined driver mutations and broad genomic sequencing.

Currently, SEAs are widely treated with bony decompression, followed by internal stabilization in purulent osteomyelitis. However, recently, a growing number of studies have reported minimally invasive approaches without internal fixation. Purpose We describe four patients with cervical SEAs that were evacuated by oblique corpectomy (OC) without fusion. Methods This study included two women and two men (aged 44-90) that received operations for removing ventral cervical SEAs. All patients presented with progressively increasing myelopathy, and 3 had severe comorbid conditions. In all cases, a multilevel OC without fusion was performed. The amount of bone resection was tailored to fit the needs of granulation removal, with an effort to retain as much of the vertebral bodies as possible. Then, pus was evacuated and debridement of granulation was performed, followed by rinsing and drainage. Results The neurological status of 3 patients improved significantly after surgery. At the last follow-up examination, one showed full recovery, and in two a minor residual deficit persisted. During mean follow-up of 5.5 years, no internal stabilization was necessary. The oldest patient was tetraplegic, and had several concomitant diseases. That patient died from sudden cardiac arrest on the third postoperative day. Oblique corpectomy did not affect the anterior or posterior column. Additionally, it provided a broad view of the ventral aspect of the spinal canal. Conclusions Oblique corpectomy allows appropriate spinal cord decompression and granulation removal in the case of cervical spine epidural abscess, without sacrificing spinal stability.Copyright © 2016",Excluded
2340,"Involved-field radiation therapy for patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: Early results of hypofractionated involved-field radiation therapy Objective. To evaluate the outcomes after treating patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) without elective nodal irradiation and to evaluate the effects of hypofractionated IFRT. Methods. From December 2004 to November 2015, 51 patients with advanced NSCLC underwent IFRT. Of these, 45 patients were enrolled and evaluated. The median age was 69 years (range, 50-89 years), and 42 patients were men and women. Eleven patients (24.4%) presented with adeno-carcinoma, 30 (66.7%) with squamous cell carcinoma, and (8.9%) with other types. Twenty-four (53.3%) had stage IIIA and 21 (46.7%) had stage IIIB. In patients treated by conventional IFRT, normal fractionation was used (2 Gy/fraction), and the total prescribed dose ranged from 60 to 66 Gy. In patients treated by hypofractionated IFRT, 2.5 Gy/fraction was used, and the total prescribed dose ranged from 65 to 70 Gy. Results. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 78.4% and 53.7% , respectively. The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 72.2% and 57.7% , respectively. The patients in the conventional IFRT group had a 1-year local control rate of 61.2% and a 2-year local control rate of 47.6%, while the patients in the hypofractionated IFRT group achieved higher local control rates of 87.1% and 72.5%, respectively (P = 0.0465) Conclusions. IFRT for patients with stage III NSCLC is feasible, and the incidence of elective nodal failure was low. Hypofractionated IFRT may therefore contribute to improvements in local control and overall survival.",Excluded
1830,"Clinical Research and Technique Note of TLIF by Wiltse Approach for the Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Objective: To assess the clinical efficacy and share the technique notes of Wiltse Approach TLIF for the treating single segment degenerative lumbar spinal disease. Method(s): In this retrospective controlled study, 780 patients with single segment degenerative lumbar disease who were operated in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were randomly assigned to Wiltse approach group (group A, 410 cases) and conventional open approach group (group B, 370 cases). Patient's assessment of pain and disability were evaluated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) before and after surgery. The incision length, operative time, exposure time, intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, serum creatine kinase, X-rays, CT and MRI were also evaluated. Result(s): There were no differences in sex, age, pre-operative ODI score, VAS score between the two groups (P > 0.05). The Wiltse approach group had a shorter incision length with 7.69 +/- 0.44 cm compared to the conventional group with 11.13 +/- 0.36 cm (P < 0.01). The average operative time was 119.20 +/- 14.64 min with exposure time of 16.20 +/- 3.42 min in the Wiltse approach group and 145.65 +/- 16.98 min with 29.20 +/- 3.42 min in the conventional group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Comparing the intraoperative blood loss, hidden blood loss, serum creatine kinase, time to ambulation, total length of hospitalization, the Wiltse approach group was less than the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The VAS score of the two groups decreased significantly with time, and the VAS score of the Wiltse group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). At last investigation after operation, ODI scores of the two groups were significantly decreased compared with that before operation. Wiltse approach group was significantly lower than that of the conventional open approach group (P < 0.05). The multifidus of the two groups of patients had a certain degree of atrophy. But the Wiltse approach group multifidus muscle atrophy rate is significantly lower than the conventional open approach group. Conclusion(s): The Wiltse approach TLIF significantly reduces the damage to the paravertebral muscles and the postoperative incidence of chronic low back pain.Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

2848,"Recurrent Atypical Meningiomas: Combining Surgery and Radiosurgery in One Effective Multimodal Treatment Objective Owing to their rarity and proteiform pathologic features, the clinical behavior of atypical meningiomas is not yet well characterized. Though the extent of resection is believed to be a key determinant of prognosis, limited data exist regarding optimal management of patients with recurrent disease. Methods In this 20-year retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 46 patients with recurrent atypical meningomas (185 lesions, 89 of which were local, 78 marginal, and 18 distant recurrences); treatment was radiosurgery (n = 60), surgery (n = 56), or both (n = 8). The median follow-up period was 53 months. Outcome measures were length of overall survival and disease-free intervals and prognostic factors for survival. Results Overall, the median progression-free survival was 26 months at the first recurrence and 100 months thereafter (the sum of the later intervals). Multivariate analysis showed that no treatment-related factors influenced prognosis, whereas recurrence at the skull base was a significant tumor-related factor limiting further treatment. Irrespective of treatment type, the recurrence-free interval was increasingly shorter during the clinical course, with a higher occurrence of marginal and distant lesions migrating to the midline and to the skull base. In sporadic cases, disease-free intervals were longer after wide craniotomy, tumor and dural resection with tumor-free margin. Conclusions The disease-free interval was substantially similar after surgery and radiosurgery for treating recurrent disease in patients with atypical meningiomas. Surgery is the mainstay for prolonging survival, while radiosurgery can be an adjuvant strategy to gain time for clinical observation and planning aggressive surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Seventeen patients (average heart rate of <=65 beats per minute [bpm] prior to acquisition) were evaluated in the HPS mode, 88 (average heart rate of >65 and <=80 bpm prior to acquisition) in the SAS mode, and 33 (average heart rate of >80 bpm prior to acquisition or patients with an unstable heart rhythm) in the LPS mode. Radiation dose and image noise were recorded for each patient. Diagnostic acceptability was graded using a four-point scale (1, unacceptable; 2, suboptimal; 3, acceptable; 4, fully acceptable)., RESULTS: The effective dose in the HPS mode was 1.5 +/- 0.2 mSv, which was lower than that in SAS (8.9 +/- 2.7 mSv) and LPS (21.5 +/- 4.3 mSv) modes. There were no significant differences in the image noise levels in the descending aorta and left atrium. The average per-patient diagnostic acceptability was 3.2, 3.6, and 3.7 in HPS, SAS, and LPS modes, respectively., CONCLUSION: The radiation dose is lower with HPS than with other modes, and the HPS mode-acquired images of patients with heart rates of <=65 bpm are nearly acceptable for diagnostic image interpretation.

3173,"Late effects in ankylosing spondylitis patients treated with 224Ra This study is comprised of 1577 ankylosing spondylitis patients from 9 German hospitals who have been treated with multiple injections of 224Ra. The majority of the patients, most of them treated in the years 1948-1975, received one series of 10 weekly intravenous injections of about 1 MBq of 224Ra each. This dose leads to a mean absorbed dose due to alpha-particle radiation of 0.56 Gy to the marrow-free skeleton of a 70-kg man (mean bone surface dose of about 5 Gy). To provide comparative information on causes of death and on health effects possibly related to the basic disease itself, a control group of 1462 ankylosing spondylitis patients with roughly the same age distribution has been established. By the end of 1998, 649 patients in the exposed group and 762 control patients had died. Among other observations, it is of particular interest that 13 cases of leukemia in the exposed group have been observed. This is a highly significant excess (P < 0.001) compared to a standard population, but only a marginally significant excess in comparison to the seven cases observed in the control group. Subclassification of the leukemias shows a clear preponderance of the myeloid leukemias in the exposed group (8 cases observed compared to 1.7 cases expected, P < 0.001), whereas in the control group the observed cases are within the expected range for myeloid leukemia (3 cases observed compared to 2.2 cases expected, P = 0.3). The 224Ra cohort of the earlier study (higher-dose group) has provided a risk coefficient that predicts about 8 excess malignant bone tumors for the irradiated cohort in this study. In actuality, 4 cases of malignant tumors in the skeleton have been observed so far. However, excess of breast cancer has not been observed in either the irradiated or the control group, which is in contrast to the findings in the earlier 224Ra cohort of Study I.",Included
1884,"Assessment of intraocular foreign bodies by helical-CT multiplanar imaging The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of helical CT in the assessment of intraocular foreign bodies, evaluating two protocols with different collimation. We performed helical-CT studies in 30 patients. Fifteen patients were examined with 1.5-mm collimation and the other 15 patients with 3.0-mm collimation. All other imaging parameters were identical in both protocols. Multiplanar images were reconstructed. The examinations were reviewed for presence, localization and size of intraocular foreign bodies. We compare our results with the surgical data. We estimate the required examination time. In the first group (collimation 1.5 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 8 of 15 patients. In 3 of 8 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. In the second group (collimation 3.0 mm) an intraorbital foreign body was detected in 9 of 15 patients. In 8 of 9 patients an intraocular foreign body (all were metallic) was detected. Our results were confirmed by surgery in all cases. Examination time was 36 s in the first group and 18 s in the second group. Computed tomography should be considered the imaging modality of choice in the assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies and 3.0-mm collimation is optional, because of reduced examination time and radiation exposure.",Excluded
2992,"Cardiac and Renal Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure: Organ Differences in Vasculopathy, Inflammation, Senescence and Oxidative Balance We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included
2640,"Outcomes and prognostic stratification of patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with salvage stereotactic radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant form of astrocytoma. The average survival is 6-10 months in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). In this study, the authors evaluated the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with rGBMs. METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of their brain tumor database (1997-2016). Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after salvage SRS were the primary endpoints evaluated. Response to SRS was assessed using volumetric MR images. RESULTS Fifty-three patients with rGBM underwent salvage SRS targeting 75 lesions. The median tumor diameter and volume were 2.55 cm and 3.80 cm3, respectively. The median prescription dose was 18 Gy (range 12-24 Gy) and the homogeneity index was 1.90 (range 1.11-2.02). The median OS after salvage SRS was estimated to be 11.0 months (95% CI 7.1-12.2) and the median PFS after salvage SRS was 4.4 months (95% CI 3.7-5.0). A Karnofsky Performance Scale score >= 80 was independently associated with longer OS, while small tumor volume (< 15 cm3) and less homogeneous treatment plans (homogeneity index > 1.75) were both independently associated with longer OS (p = 0.007 and 0.03) and PFS (p = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Based on these factors, 2 prognostic groups were identified for PFS (5.4 vs 3.2 months), while 3 were identified for OS (median OS of 15.2 vs 10.5 vs 5.2 months). CONCLUSIONS SRS is associated with longer OS and/or PFS in patients with good performance status, small-volume tumor recurrences, and heterogeneous treatment plans. The authors propose a prognostic model to identify a cohort of rGBM patients who may benefit from SRS.Copyright ©AANS 2019",Excluded
2769,"Urological applications of computerized axial tomography Computerized tomography (CT scanning) of the chest and abdomen has been used as a diagnostic technique in more than 7,200 patients since 1974, 250 of whom had histological proved disorders of the genitourinary system and retroperitoneum. On the basis of this experience CT scanning has been found to be safe and effective, and offers certain advantages over conventional techniques. The number, extent and content of adrenal and renal mass lesions can be determined with relatively great accuracy. The presence and extent of metastases into the retroperitoneum, liver and chest often can be shown by CT scanning when other tests are negative. Placement of needles for aspiration, biopsy, injection of contrast medium or insertion of drainage tubes can be done accurately under computerized tomographic control. Air contrast scanning of the bladder can be of real help in staging bladder tumors, espically in obese patients. Computerized tomography in itself is non-invasive, carries a low radiation exposure comparable to other radiographic procedures and therefore, can, be valuable in following the course of patients with various diseases during and after therapy. While CT scanning will not replace other diagnostic procedures it should lead to a more judicious selection of potentially hazardous tests, such as angiography, aspiration and open biopsy.",Excluded
918,"UV dose determines key characteristics of nonmelanoma skin cancer Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC), are the most common cancers worldwide. Although many factors are involved in the pathogenesis of NMSC, UV radiation is an important risk factor. A fundamental question in skin cancer research is whether varying doses of total UV radiation influence key characteristics of NMSC. The hypothesis that differences in UV doses influence the BCC/ SCC ratio, number of tumors, and anatomic location of the tumor was investigated in 311 participants having 326 tumors and with exposure to a broad range of UV doses. An epidemiologic questionnaire was given to each participant soliciting detailed information on exposure to solar radiation. Environmental UVA and UVB doses were measured continually for 6 years at a permanent UV monitoring station. The total ratio of BCC/SCC was 3.5. Participants who received low and high UV doses had a BCC/SCC ratio of 4.2. Those who received very high UV doses had a ratio of 2.1. A very high UV dose was also associated with the doubling of the total number of tumors per person and a significantly increased risk of having SCC, a more aggressive malignancy. Tumors in sun-exposed areas (on the body) were more common in participants who received high and very high UV doses. The tumors in sun-protected areas were associated with exposure to lower levels of UV. This large-scale population study provides evidence that varying doses of UV radiation have a profound influence on key characteristics of NMSC.",Excluded
162,"Nonlinear interactions of high-frequency oscillations in the human somatosensory system OBJECTIVE: The source of somatosensory evoked high-frequency activity at about 600 Hz is still not completely clear. Hence, we aimed to study the influence of double stimulation on the human somatosensory system by analyzing both the low-frequency activity and the high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) at about 600 Hz., METHODS: We used median nerve stimulation at seven interstimuli intervals (ISIs) with a high time resolution between 2.4 and 4.8 ms to investigate the N15, N20 and superimposed HFOs. Simultaneously, the electroencephalogram and the magnetoencephalogram of 12 healthy participants were recorded. Subsequently, the source analysis of precortical and cortical dipoles was performed., RESULTS: The difference computations of precortical dipole activation curves showed in both the low- and high-frequency range a correlation between the ISI and the latency of the second stimulus response. The cortical low-frequency response showed a similar behavior. Contrarily, in the second response of cortical HFOs this latency shift could not be confirmed. We found amplitude fluctuations that were dependent on the ISI in the low-frequency activity and the HFOs. These nonlinear interactions occurred at ISIs, which differ by one full HFO period (1.6 ms)., CONCLUSIONS: Low-frequency activity and HFOs originate from different generators. Precortical and cortical HFOs are independently generated. The amplitude fluctuations dependent on ISI indicate nonlinear interference between successive stimuli., SIGNIFICANCE: Information processing in human somatosensory system includes nonlinearity.",Excluded
2195,"Histopathologic Analysis of Lung Cancer Incidence Associated with Radon Exposure among Ontario Uranium Miners Although radon is a well-established contributor to lung cancer mortality among uranium miners, the effects of radon decay products on different histopathologies of lung carcinoma are not well established. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study aims to examine the risks of lung cancer by histological subtypes associated with exposure to radon decay products among the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort. Cases were stratified by histological groups, and associated risks were estimated for cumulative radon exposure after adjustment for attained age and calendar period. Between 1969 and 2005, 1274 incident cases of primary lung cancer were identified. Of these, 1256 diagnoses (99%) contained information on histology. Squamous cell carcinoma was most common (31%), followed by adenocarcinoma (20%), large cells (18%), small cell lung carcinoma (14%), and other or unspecified cell types (17%). Of the histological sub-groups, small cell lung carcinoma had the strongest association with cumulative radon exposure; compared to the reference group (<1 cumulative working level months (WLM)), the highest exposure category (>60 cumulative WLM) had a relative risk (RR) of 2.76 (95% CI: 1.67-4.57). Adenocarcinoma had the lowest risk and was not significantly associated with exposure to radon decay products (RR = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.96-2.31). An increasing, linear trend in relative risk was noted with increasing cumulative WLM across small cell, squamous cell, and large cell lung carcinomas (Ptrend < 0.05). Similarly, the excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was highest for small cell lung carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.15, p < 0.01), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.12, p < 0.01). Non-statistically significant excess risk was observed for adenocarcinoma (ERR/WLM = 0.004, p = 0.07). Our analysis of the Ontario Uranium Miners cohort data shows differences in the magnitude of the risks across four histological subtypes of lung carcinoma; the strongest association was noted for small cell lung carcinoma, followed by squamous cell, large cell, and lastly adenocarcinoma, which showed no significant associations with exposure to radon decay products.",Included
2451,"Developmental switch from LTD to LTP in low frequency-induced plasticity The stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers at low frequency (1 Hz) for 3-5 min can trigger a slow-onset form of low-frequency stimulation (LFS)-long-term potentiation (LTP) (LFS-LTP) in the CA1 area of the adult rat hippocampus. Here we have examined the developmental profile of this plasticity. In 9-15 day-old rats, the application of 1 Hz for 5 min induced long-term depression (LFS-LTD). In 17-21 day-old rats, 1 Hz stimulation had no effect when applied for 5 min but mediated LTD when stimulus duration was increased to 15 min. Over 25 day-old, 1 Hz stimulation mediated LFS-LTP. LFS-LTD was dependent on both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and mGlu5 receptor activation. Antagonists of mGlu1alpha and cannabinoid type 1 receptor were ineffective to block LTD induction. LFS-LTD was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a postsynaptic locus of expression of this plasticity. Next, we examined whether LFS-LTD was related to 'chemical' LTDs obtained by the direct stimulation of mGlu5 and NMDA receptors. The saturation of LFS-LTD completely occluded NMDA- and (RS)-2-Chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG)-induced LTD. CHPG-LTD and NMDA-LTD occluded each other. In addition, we observed that NMDA-LTD was dependent on mGlu5 receptor activation in 9-12 day old rats while it was not in animals older than 15 day-old. Therefore we postulate that during LFS application, NMDA and mGlu5 receptor could interact to trigger LTD. Low-frequency-mediated synaptic plasticity is subject to a developmental switch from NMDA- and mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTD to mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTP with a transient period (17-21 day-old) during which LFS is ineffective.",Excluded
837,"Radiation metabolomics. 5. Identification of urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in nonhuman primates by mass spectrometry-based metabolomics Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has previously demonstrated utility for identifying biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in cellular, mouse and rat in vivo radiation models. To provide a valuable link from small laboratory rodents to humans, gamma-radiation-induced urinary biomarkers were investigated using a nonhuman primate total-body-irradiation model. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approaches were applied to determine whether biomarkers could be identified, as well as the previously discovered rodent biomarkers of gamma radiation. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a time course of clean-catch urine samples collected from nonhuman primates (n = 6 per cohort) exposed to sham, 1.0, 3.5, 6.5 or 8.5 Gy doses of (60)Co gamma ray (~0.55 Gy/min) ionizing radiation. By multivariate data analysis, 13 biomarkers of radiation were discovered: N-acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, taurine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, creatine, creatinine, tyrosol sulfate, 3-hydroxytyrosol sulfate, tyramine sulfate, N-acetylserotonin sulfate, and adipic acid. N-Acetyltaurine, isethionic acid, and taurine had previously been identified in rats, and taurine and xanthine in mice after ionizing radiation exposure. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics has thus successfully revealed and verified urinary biomarkers of ionizing radiation exposure in the nonhuman primate for the first time, which indicates possible mechanisms for ionizing radiation injury.",Included
2154,"Toxicities Following Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy Treatment of Locally-Recurrent and Previously Irradiated Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with concomitant cetuximab is an effective treatment option for previously irradiated, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Its local control and overall survival are similar to those of other available treatment options. Each retreatment depends heavily on the prior treatment and every patient is a special case. Based on the experience of our institution and previously published studies, for patients who receive concomitant cetuximab with a median prior radiation therapy dose of 70Gy, we recommend a total dose of 40-44Gy delivered in 5 fractions on alternating days over 1-2 weeks. However, Grade 2 or 3 toxicities are not uncommon. Therefore, in this review, we also report a pilot study that applies a normal tissue complication probability dose-response model to estimate the probability of toxicities in locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck reirradiated with SABR. Although this dose-response model includes concurrent targeted therapy and no comparable model yet exists for SABR without it, complication rates without concurrent biological therapy or chemotherapy should be no higher than those described here.

1299,"Comparative efficacy of repetitive nerve stimulation, exercise, and cold in differentiating myotonic disorders The decremental response of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) to provocative tests is not characterized in genetically verified myotonic disorders. We therefore studied the relationship between decremental responses and mutation type in 10 patients with recessive myotonia congenita (rMC), two with paramyotonia congenita (PMC), nine with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), four with DM2, and 14 healthy people. CMAPs were measured at rest, just after a short exercise test (SET), and during short, 5- and 10-HZ, repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) trains at 32 degrees C and at 20 degrees C. The degree of decrement was not related to the severity of clinical myotonia. Controls and PMC patients had similar responses when warm, but with cooling PMC patients had a persistent decrement of CMAPs. In the rMC patients the decremental responses were related to the type of mutation of the CLCN1 gene, as a decrement was encountered in the T268M, R894X, IVS17+1 G>T, K248X, and 2149 del G, but not with the IVS1+3 A>T, F167L, or dominant A313T mutations. In DM1 patients there was no relationship between decrement and CTG repeats. The degree of partial inexcitability in myotonic muscle membrane therefore depends on the mutation type rather than degree of clinical myotonia. RNS at 10 HZ is more sensitive than SET for demonstrating abnormalities in rMC patients when warm; differences are less marked when cold, which is useful to diagnose PMC. Provocative tests are therefore useful in myotonias to demonstrate muscle inexcitability, which depends on the chloride or sodium channelopathy.",Excluded
1914,"A comparison of neuron response properties in areas A1 and CM of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex: tones and broadband noise The purpose of this study was to compare response properties of two adjacent areas of the marmoset monkey auditory cortex. Multiunit responses to 50 ms tones and broadband noise bursts (BBN) were recorded in the core area, A1, and the caudomedial belt area, CM, of ketamine-anesthetized animals. Neurons in A1 and CM exhibited robust low-threshold short-latency responses to BBN and tones, whereas neurons in adjoining lateral belt areas were poorly responsive or unresponsive to tones and noise. Except for a population of broadly tuned units in CM, the characteristic frequency (CF) could be determined for all recording sites in A1 and CM. Both areas were tonotopically organized and shared a high CF border. Whereas the tonotopic gradient in A1 was smooth and continuous across the field, the gradient in CM was discontinuous, and the intermediate CF range was underrepresented. For BBN stimuli, rate level functions were largely monotonic in A1 and CM. Response profiles were also similar in both areas. As a population, neurons in CM were distinguished from A1 by significantly shorter response latencies, lower thresholds, and broader tuning bandwidth at higher intensities. The results indicated that, while A1 and CM represent anatomically and physiologically distinct areas, their response profiles under anesthesia overlapped considerably compared with the lateral belt areas. Therefore refinements of current models of the primate auditory cortex may be needed to account for differences in organization among the auditory belt areas.",Excluded
1464,"Effect of Cisplatin on parotid gland function in concomitant radiochemotherapy PURPOSE: To determine the influence of concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin on parotid gland tissue complication probability., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients treated with either radiotherapy (n = 61) or concomitant radiochemotherapy with cisplatin (n = 36) for head-and-neck cancer were prospectively evaluated. The dose and volume distributions of the parotid glands were noted in dose-volume histograms. Stimulated salivary flow rates were measured before, during the 2(nd) and 6(th) weeks and at 4 weeks and 6 months after the treatment. The data were fit using the normal tissue complication probability model of Lyman. Complication was defined as a reduction of the salivary flow rate to less than 25% of the pretreatment flow rate., RESULTS: The normal tissue complication probability model parameter TD(50) (the dose leading to a complication probability of 50%) was found to be 32.2 Gy at 4 weeks and 32.1 Gy at 6 months for concomitant radiochemotherapy and 41.1 Gy at 4 weeks and 39.6 Gy at 6 months for radiotherapy. The tolerated dose for concomitant radiochemotherapy was at least 7 to 8 Gy lower than for radiotherapy alone at TD(50)., CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the concomitant radiochemotherapy tended to cause a higher probability of parotid gland tissue damage. Advanced radiotherapy planning approaches such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may be particularly important for parotid sparing in radiochemotherapy because of cisplatin-related increased radiosensitivity of glands.",Excluded
1293,"A randomized comparison of the transradial and transfemoral approaches for coronary artery bypass graft angiography and intervention: the RADIAL-CABG Trial (RADIAL Versus Femoral Access for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Angiography and Intervention) OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare and contrast use and radiation exposure using radial versus femoral access during cardiac catheterization of patients who had previously undergone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery., BACKGROUND: Limited information is available on the relative merits of radial compared with femoral access for cardiac catheterization in patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery., METHODS: Consecutive patients (N = 128) having previously undergone CABG surgery and referred for cardiac catheterization were randomized to radial or femoral access. The primary study endpoint was contrast volume. Secondary endpoints included fluoroscopy time, procedure time, patient and operator radiation exposure, vascular complications, and major adverse cardiac events. Analyses were by intention-to-treat., RESULTS: Compared with femoral access, diagnostic coronary angiography via radial access was associated with a higher mean contrast volume (142 +/- 39 ml vs. 171 +/- 72 ml, p < 0.01), longer procedure time (21.9 +/- 6.8 min vs. 34.2 +/- 14.7 min, p < 0.01), greater patient air kerma (kinetic energy released per unit mass) radiation exposure (1.08 +/- 0.54 Gy vs. 1.29 +/- 0.67 Gy, p = 0.06), and higher operator radiation dose (first operator: 1.3 +/- 1.0 mrem vs. 2.6 +/- 1.7 mrem, p < 0.01; second operator 0.8 +/- 1.1 mrem vs. 1.8 +/- 2.1 mrem, p = 0.01). Fewer patients underwent ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the radial group (37.5% vs. 46.9%, p = 0.28) and radial PCI procedures were less complex. The incidences of the primary and secondary endpoints was similar with femoral and radial access among PCI patients. Access crossover was higher in the radial group (17.2% vs. 0.0%, p < 0.01) and vascular access site complications were similar in both groups (3.1%)., CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had previously undergone CABG surgery, transradial diagnostic coronary angiography was associated with greater contrast use, longer procedure time, and greater access crossover and operator radiation exposure compared with transfemoral angiography.

2697,"First-arterial-pass dual-energy CT for assessment of myocardial blood supply: Do we need rest, stress, and delayed acquisition? Comparison with SPECT Purpose: To compare the relative contributions of rest, stress, and delayed acquisitions with the accuracy of dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT) for the assessment of myocardial blood supply. Material(s) and Method(s): With institutional review board approval and HIPAA compliance, 55 consecutive patients (10 women, 45 men; mean age, 62 years 6 10) clinically referred for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) who were known to have or were suspected of having coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. DE CT studies were acquired during adenosine stress, at rest, and after 6-minute delay. The DE CT iodine distribution maps were visually assessed for perfusion deficits or late iodine enhancement. Per-segment agreement between modalities was investigated with k statistics. Test characteristics for the detection of perfusion deficits were calculated for combinations of rest, stress, and delayed DE CT acquisition, with SPECT as reference standard. Result(s): At SPECT, 714 segments were considered normal, 192 showed fixed perfusion defects, and 29 showed reversible perfusion deficits. Sensitivity of rest-only DE CT was 92%, and specificity was 98%. Stress-only, rest-stress, stress and delayed, and the combination of all three had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 97%. Of 29 segments with reversible perfusion deficits at SPECT, 13 (45%) were misclassified by using rest-stress DE CT as fixed perfusion deficits. With stress DE CT plus delayed acquisition, 13 of 192 (7%) segments with fixed perfusion deficits at SPECT were misclassified as reversible. Conclusion(s): Rest-stress acquisition should be the protocol of choice for assessment of the myocardial blood supply in DE CT. The accuracy of DE CT is not increased by the addition of a delayed DE CT acquisition, which may therefore be omitted to reduce radiation exposure. With rest-stress DE CT, almost one-half of defects that are reversible at SPECT were classified as fixed; radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of this incongruence when they interpret DE CT myocardial perfusion studies. © 2014 RSNA.",Excluded

2646,"Fast-neutron irradiation of glioblastoma multiforme. Neuropathological analysis Various modes of therapy, alone or in combination, have had little effect in improving the survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Recently, in a pilot study, 34 patients with glioblastoma were treated by fast-neutron-beam irradiation of the whole brain. Following treatment, the patients became steroid-dependent and pursued a gradual downhill course with increasing obtundation. Although there was no improvement in the length or quality of survival of these patients, neuropathological studies in the 13 patients who came to autopsy showed the following: 1) extensive coagulative necrosis of much of the tumor mass; 2) dense infiltration by collagenous connective tissue; 3) minimal phagocytic reaction; 4) marked reduction in the amount of viable tumor; 5) abnormal astrocytic proliferation, which may represent either astrocytoma or a radiation-induced bizarre gliosis, and 6) areas of gliosis and white matter degeneration in the brain stem, remote form the tumor site. These observations suggest that continued efforts to further refine this mode of therapy for glioblastoma are warranted.",Excluded
66,"Occipitocervical fixation in the management of craniocervical instabilities Introduction: The occipitocervical junction presents a unique, complex, biomechanical interface between the cranium and the upper cervical spine. Occipitocervical fixation has undergone significant evolution due to advances in operative techniques and instrumentation techniques. Objective(s): This study was done to evaluate clinical picture, radiographic findings and results of occipitocervical fusion in 10 patients with craniocervical instabilities. Also to compare these results with other results reported in the literature. Method(s): This retrospective study reviewed 10 patients who underwent occipitocervical fixation for craniocervical instabilities between April 2007 and October 2010 in Alexandria hospitals. There were 7 males and 3 females and their ages ranged from 16 to 63. years with mean age of 42.1. years. As regards the clinical presentation, all patients had presented with neck pain before surgery, 8 patients (80%) with myelopathy, and 8 patients (80%) had presented with a neurological deficit either motor or sensory or both. The etiologies of occipitocervical instability in this study were trauma in three patients, rheumatoid arthritis in three patients, tumor in two patients and Down syndrome in two patients. All patients had preoperative craniocervical plain X-ray, CT and MRI examination. All patients underwent occipitocervical fixation surgery with various fixation systems and autologous bone grafts for fusion. Fusion was assessed by plain cervical X-ray films and CT scan, and the neurological outcome by Frankel grade. The mean follow-up period was 14.7. months (range, 4-24. months) including both clinical and radiological examinations. Result(s): There were no operative mortalities or vascular injuries in this series. Two patients showed transient neurological deterioration postoperatively that had resolved within three months. Two cases had superficial wound infection and one case had cerebrospinal fluid leak. The mean operation time was 207. min (range 130-320. min) and the mean volume of blood loss was 354. mL (range 120-750. mL). Neck pain improved in all patients and no new instability developed at adjacent levels. Regarding the Frankel grade, five patients had shown improvement (Three patients improved from Frankel grade C to grade D, one patient from grade A to grade B and one patient from grade D to grade E), while five patients remained stationary at the same grade. At the last follow-up examination period, a solid fusion was achieved in nine patients out of ten (90%). Conclusion(s): Occiptocervical fixation is indicated in the management of craniocervical instabilities resulting from trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, tumors and congenital anomalies of the craniocervical junction. Accurate imaging studies and proper patient selection are the keys to a successful outcome. Occipitocervical fusion procedures can be performed with low morbidity. A comprehensive knowledge of the anatomy of the occipital-cervical junction is imperative. A wide variety of stabilization techniques and instrumentation systems are currently available, each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. © 2011.",Excluded
333,"Integration of functional MRI and white matter tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of the integration of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging tractography data into stereotactic radiosurgery clinical practice., METHODS AND MATERIALS: fMRI and tractography data sets were acquired and fused with corresponding anatomical MR and computed tomography images of patients with arteriovenous malformation (AVM), astrocytoma, brain metastasis, or hemangioma and referred for stereotactic radiosurgery. The acquired data sets were imported into a CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery system and used to delineate the target, organs at risk, and nearby functional structures and fiber tracts. Treatment plans with and without the incorporation of the functional structures and the fiber tracts into the optimization process were developed and compared., RESULTS: The nearby functional structures and fiber tracts could receive doses of >50% of the maximum dose if they were excluded from the planning process. In the AVM case, the doses received by the Broadmann-17 structure and the optic tract were reduced to 700 cGy from 1,400 cGy and to 1,200 cGy from 2,000 cGy, respectively, upon inclusion into the optimization process. In the metastasis case, the motor cortex received 850 cGy instead of 1,400 cGy; and in the hemangioma case, the pyramidal tracts received 780 cGy instead of 990 cGy. In the astrocytoma case, the dose to the motor cortex bordering the lesion was reduced to 1,900 cGy from 2,100 cGy, and therefore, the biologically equivalent dose in three fractions was delivered instead., CONCLUSIONS: Functional structures and fiber tracts could receive high doses if they were not considered during treatment planning. With the aid of fMRI and tractography images, they can be delineated and spared. Copyright (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2199,"A Retrospective Review of Re-irradiating Patients' Recurrent High-grade Gliomas Aims: After radical treatment, most high-grade gliomas (HGG) recur locally. Upon recurrence, no standard treatment exists. Options include re-resection, salvage systemic therapy and re-irradiation. This retrospective study evaluated patients who underwent re-irradiation for recurrent HGGs and assessed prognostic factors and their influence on management. Material(s) and Method(s): Eighty-two patients who underwent re-irradiation for HGG from 2009 to 2014 were retrospectively identified. Re-irradiation consisted of either standard three-dimensional conformal, intensity-modulated radiotherapy or highly conformal stereotactic radiotherapy using mostly volumetric modulated arc therapy. Patient survival from re-irradiation was the primary end point. Survival was estimated via the Kaplan-Meier method with differences assessed using the Log-rank test; hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression analysis. Result(s): The median overall survival from re-irradiation was 9.5 months. Re-irradiation, to a median dose of 35 Gy in 10 fractions, was well tolerated: 4% developed grade 3 toxicity, no patients experienced grade >=4 or radionecrosis. In the multivariate analysis, factors significantly associated with increased survival included: longer duration from initial radiotherapy, better performance status at re-irradiation of 0-1 versus >=2, unifocal versus multifocal recurrence and higher total re-irradiation dose (>=35 Gy versus <35 Gy). Re-resection, salvage systemic therapy and age were unrelated to survival. Conclusion(s): Patients with recurrent HGG tolerated re-irradiation well with minimal toxicity. Those patients in good prognostic groups, including good performance status can achieve durable control, suggesting managing patients with regular magnetic resonance imaging surveillance post-radical treatment, identifying early radiological progression and instituting salvage therapy when performance status is best.Copyright © 2018 The Royal College of Radiologists",Excluded
1011,"Osteoradionecrosis of the mandible after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer: risk factors and dose-volume correlations Background: The project aimed at determining the incidence of mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) after radiotherapy, possible risk factors, and mandibular dose-volume effects in a large cohort of head and neck cancer patients (HNC). Methods: The cohort consisted of 1224 HNC patients treated with 66-68 Gy in 2007-2015 predominantly with IMRT. ORN cases were defined from clinical observations at follow-up and through hospital code diagnostics after oral-maxillofacial surgery and cross-checked with the national Danish Head and Neck Cancer database. In a nested case-control study, patients with ORN cases were matched with two controls (1:2) and pre-RT dental procedures including surgery to the mandible were documented. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied using demographic and treatment variables including dental procedures, smoking and tumor characteristics, and combined with dosimetric data. Mean mandibular dose (Dmean) was pre-selected for the multivariable model. Results: ORN was recorded in 56 cases (4.6%) with a median time to event of 10.9 months (range 1.8-89.7) after RT, 90% occurred within 37.4 months. Median follow-up time was 22 months (0.3-95). Average Dmean was significantly higher in the ORN event cohort and significant dose-volume differences were observed for population mean DVH doses between 30 Gy and 60 Gy. In univariable analysis, smoking (HR = 1.69; CI 1.14-2.5), pre-RT surgery/tooth extraction (HR = 2.76; 1.48-5.14), and several dosimetric parameters including Dmean (HR = 1.05, 1.02-1.08) were all significantly associated with ORN. Dmean and surgery/tooth extraction remained significant predictors of ORN in multivariable analysis, HR = 1.04 (CI 1.01-1.07) and HR = 2.09 (CI 1.1-3.98), respectively, while smoking only retained its significance in an interaction analysis with pre-RT dental procedures. Conclusion: The onset of ORN of the mandible was early (median 10.8 months) and the incidence low (4.6%) after IMRT in HNC cancer patients. Surgery to the mandible and pre-RT tooth extraction, tobacco smoking, and treatment dose were associated with the development of ORN.",Excluded
726,"Photochemical repair of Achilles tendon rupture in a rat model Background. Photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) is an emerging technique for bonding or sealing tissue surfaces that requires light and a photoactive dye for its effect. The potential of PTB for tendon repair was assessed in a rat model. Materials and methods. The optical properties of bovine tendon were determined ex vivo to gauge the depth of light penetration as a function of wavelength and dosimetry parameters were established for PTB repair of ruptured tendon. PTB was then tested in vivo to repair transected tendons in Sprague-Dawley rats. Repair strengths were measured using a strain gauge up to 14 days post treatment. Results. The effective penetration depth in tendon was estimated to be 0.68 mm at 514 nm. Following PTB treatment of mechanically ruptured tendon, significant bonding was dependent on the presence of both light and dye and attained a plateau strength at a fluence of 125 J/cm2. In a subsequent in vivo study to investigate PTB for repair of transected rat Achilles tendon, the ultimate stress required to break the repaired tendon was measured immediately after irradiation and at 7 and 14 days post-repair. Results showed that the difference in the ultimate stress between control and PTB treatment groups was statistically significant immediately after treatment and at 7 days (p = 0.04) but not 14 days (p = 0.75) post-repair. Conclusions. PTB provides a benefit to tendon repair at early stages in repair and is worthy of further investigation as a potential surgical adjunct for tendon repair in orthopedic surgeries. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

852,"Stricture of the proximal esophagus in head and neck carcinoma patients after radiotherapy BACKGROUND. It is well recognized that many patients with head and neck carcinoma have problems with food intake and malnutrition. The objective of the current study was to determine the clinical pattern of patients with nonneoplastic stricture of the upper esophagus after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. METHODS. A retrospective chart study of 22 patients with stricture of the proximal esophagus diagnosed between 1993 and 1999 at Karolinska Hospital was performed. The dose volume histograms of the first 2 cm and 5 cm, respectively, of the proximal esophagus were calculated. RESULTS. Five of the patients (23%) had total obliteration. The first 2 cm of the esophagus received at least 60 grays (Gy) in > 80% of the volume. Radiation injury was not reported to occur at doses < 60 Gy. There was a correlation found between dysphagia during radiotherapy and the development of proximal esophageal stricture. Stricture was diagnosed 1-60 months (median, 6 months) after radiotherapy. In 18 patients, the stricture was treated with single or repeated endoscopic dilation. These treatments allowed a nearly normal diet in 78% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Stricture of the upper esophagus is one deglutition disorder that is reported to occur after radiotherapy for head and neck carcinoma. In the current study, the authors emphasize the importance of knowing the tolerance of the normal esophagus to irradiation as well as early diagnosis of stricture of the proximal esophagus because this condition may lead to physical and emotional distress. © 2003 American Cancer Society.",Excluded

In addition, results of outcomes after repeat ablation in the elderly are lacking. We report the results of first repeat AF ablation procedures of aged patients from a real-world multicenter prospective registry. Method(s): Patients undergoing second AF ablation included in the prospective, multicenter German Ablation Registry were divided in two groups (age > 70 years (group 1) and age <= 70 years (group 2)) and analyzed for procedural characteristics and clinical follow-up. Result(s): 738 patients were analyzed (108 patients in group 1, 630 patients in group 2).

3003,"Relative Safety of External Beam Radiation Therapy in Lung Transplant Recipients Who Develop Thoracic Malignancies We report outcomes for three patients who previously received lung transplants, subsequently developed malignancies, and were given radiation therapy to the chest for treatment of their cancers despite lack of scientific data on radiation tolerance of transplanted lung. None of three patients exhibited early or delayed adverse reactions to radiotherapy. For these three cases, the mean dose to the ipsilateral transplanted lung was 10 Gy, and ipsilateral lung relative volume of lung receiving 20 Gy or more was, on average, 22%. These doses are relatively low and would have been considered safe for patients with native lungs. In our opinion, tolerance of transplanted lung to therapeutic radiotherapy clearly requires additional research. While those data are pending, radiation therapy to the thorax should not be ruled out on the basis of having a lung transplant alone, provided lung dose can be maintained as low as possible using meticulous treatment planning.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

2680,"Radiation and host factors in human thyroid tumors following thymus irradiation In this paper thyroid tumor data from the 1971 survey of the Rochester, New York thymus irradiated population are further analyzed to study radiobiological and host factors. The analyses were based on the approximately 2650 irradiated subjects and 4800 sibling controls who had 5 or more years of follow-up. Twenty-four thyroid cancers and 52 thyroid adenomas were found in the irradiated group, and 0 thyroid cancers and 6 adenomas among the controls. The overall risk estimates were 3.8 thyroid cancers/106 PY-rad and 4.5 thyroid adenomas/106 PY-rad. The dose-response data (thyroid dose range of 5 to > 1000 rad) for thyroid cancer indicate both a linear and a dose-squared component, but no dose-squared component is evident for thyroid adenomas. At lower total doses (< 400 rad) there was a suggestion that dose fractionation diminished the thyroid cancer response, but a similar fractionation effect was not found for thyroid adenomas. The temporal pattern of tumors suggested an extended plateau of excess tumor production, rather than a 'wavelike' temporal pattern. There was no evidence for an inverse relationship between thyroid radiation dose and thyroid cancer latency. Female and Jewish subjects had a higher risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer than did their respective counterparts. The additive and multiplicative models of radiation effects were compared with respect to sex differences; neither model provided a superior fit to the data. The tentative nature of the conclusion is stressed because of the relatively small number of thyroid cancers.",Included
675,"Modalities of surveillance in treated nasopharyngeal cancer OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the efficacy of different modalities in the detection of disease during the early posttreatment period of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We prospectively evaluated 57 patients with NPC who were treated with radiation. A postnasal space (PNS) biopsy, an endoscopic examination, and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed 4 months after treatment. RESULT(S): Four patients had evidence of disease in the PNS biopsy specimen. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the endoscopic examination were 75%, 94.3%, 50%, and 98%, respectively, while those of the CT scan were 50%, 49.1%, 6.9%, and 92.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): In the early postradiation period for patients with NPC, an endoscopic examination is a suitable surveillance modality, but routine CT scanning has no added clinical benefit. SIGNIFICANCE: When an endoscopic examination of the PNS yields normal results, a biopsy is not necessary because the likelihood of disease is low.",Excluded
3150,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions.

Design and method: A total of 126 HD patients (74m 52w; average age 61.5+/-15.8) were enrolled. All patients were dialysed by European and KDIGO guidelines. ABPM (24-hours) was performed with SpaceLab 90207 after mid-week dialysis; pulse wave velocity (PWV) and aortic augmentation index (AIx) were measured using Arteriograph after mid-week dialysis. Malnutritioninflammation score (MIS) and protein energy wasting (PEW) score were calculated in all enrolled patients. There were 67.6% of patients without prior CV disease, and prior coronary heart disease, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were diagnosed in 7.1%, 5,6%, 4.7%, 8.7%, 3.9% patients, respectively. Prior diabetes and prior hypertension were diagnosed in 26.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Result(s): There were 74.6% of non-dippers, while white coat hypertension and masked hypertension were diagnosed in 25.4% and 7.9%, respectively. During the follow up period of 48 months 69 patients died from all-cause and 53 from CV mortality. Diurnal variations of blood pressure were not associated with all-cause mortality. Neither white-coat nor masked hypertension were associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with arterio-venous fistula showed significantly better survival when compared to patients with permanent dialysis catheters and in the linear regression model MIS/PEW and PWV were the only predictors of longer survival (b =-0.371, p = 0.001; b =-0.249, p = 0.009). Conclusion(s): Blood pressure characteristics (ABPM) were not predictors of allcause mortality in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. On contrary, arterial stiffness and malnutrition were associated with shorter survival. Observed better survival of patients with A-V fistula compared to patients with permanent catheter is very probably reverse epidemiology. Due to small number of CV deaths we were not able to perform analyzes of CV deaths.",Excluded
2229,"Outcome analysis of adjuvant chemoradiation after incomplete resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): To analyze the outcome of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent incomplete resection, and to identify the prognostic factors for these patients. Materials/Methods: Data from 41 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent R1 or R2 resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy from January 1987 to March 2010 was collected. There were 27 men and 14 women, and the median age was 60 years (range, 40-84). The adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was delivered to the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes. Radiation dose was less than 50 Gy for 22 patients and at least 50 Gy for 19 patients. The chemotherapy during radiotherapy was either 5-fluorouracil (n = 37) or capecitabine (n = 4). The median follow-up duration was 15.8 months (range 4.5 -53.4). Result(s): The median survival was 13.2 months and the 2-year overall survival (OS) was 17% ; the median time to failure was 7.5 months and 2-year progression free survival (PFS) rate was 9% ; the median time to distant metastasis was 9.2 months and the 2- year distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) rate was 27% ; the median time to locoregional failure was 10.8 months and the locoregional failure free survival (LRFFS) rate was 16%. On univariate analysis, nodal involvement (p = 0.046), post-operative CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs>37 U/mL,p=0.027) and post-RT CA 19-9 (<=37 U/mL vs.37 U/mL, p<0.001) were associated with OS. Nodal involvement (p = 0.053 for PFS, p = 0.029 for LRFFS), initial CA 19-9 (<=1000 U/mL vs .1000 U/mL, p = 0.029 for PFS,p=0.003 for LRFFS), post-operative CA 19-9 (p=0.03 for PFS,p= 0.035 for LRFFS) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001 for PFS and LRFFS) were statistically significant prognosticators for PFS and LRFFS. For DMFS, nodal involvement (p=0.054) and post-RT CA 19-9 (p<0.001) were significant prognosticators. On multivariate analysis, only post-RT CA 19-9 showed statistical significance for all outcomes. There was no difference in all outcomes between R1 resection and R2 resection. RT dose was not a significant prognostic factor for all outcomes. However, in a subgroup analysis of 21 patients who had pancreatic head cancer and underwent 3-dimensional conformal RT, lower radiation dose was related with inferior PFS and DMFS (p = 0.085 and p = 0.068, respectively). Conclusion(s): Patients with pancreatic cancer after incomplete resection have poor outcomes even after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Nodal involvement and CA 19-9 were prognostic factors, whereas increased radiation dose showed marginal significance.",Excluded
2670,"Seroprevalence and its impact on radiographic damage in korean rheumatoid arthritis patients starting biologics Background/Purpose: High titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACCP) are poor prognostic factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Only few studies have investigated the detailed clinical subtypes or radiographic changes based on serologic status; double (RF/ACCP) positive (+ve), RF or ACCP +ve, double negative (-ve) (seronegative, SN). We aimed to analyze the clinical and radiographic features of RA patients with robust disease activity, based on their serologic status. Method(s): RA patients registered in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry (KOBIO), a nationwide inception cohort, were analyzed. Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidity, disease activity, medication, imaging and laboratory exams were utilized. After adjusting for gender, age, disease duration, and smoking history, we analyzed the association of seropositivity and bony erosion (hands and feet X-ray), and the association of the ACCP titer and joint damage, both at baseline (initiation of biologics) presented as odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval [95% CI]. Result(s): Data of 1198 RA patients were investigated. Mean age was 57.2 years, and disease duration was 8.3 +/- 7.6 years. Mean DAS28-ESR was 5.71, and erosion were found in 40.1% of patients. Being ACCP+ve was significantly associated with bony erosions (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.52], p= 0.0096), compared with RF+ve (OR 1.03 p= 0.83), or RF+ve/ACCP+ve (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.19-4.01], p= 0.012). Of note, being ACCP+ve/RF-ve was strongly associated with radiographic damage (OR 4.93 [95% CI 2.29-10.61], p< 0.0001) in our analysis (figure). In contrast, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ACCP titers were not positively associated with joint damage; a multivariate linear regression model revealed disease duration (estimate -3.95, p< 0.0001) and RF titer (estimate +0.0665, p= 0.0157) were associated with ACCP titers. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate the significance of ACCP in predicting radiographic damage in established Korean RA patients with persistently high disease activity. Longitudinal studies would be needed to clarify the impact of ACCP titers on radiographic progression. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
1785,"Utility of dual-energy CT for predicting the vascularity of meningiomas PURPOSE: Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) can provide iodine, electron density (ED), and effective atomic number Z (Zeff) maps, facilitating the identification of tissue types. We investigated whether DECT parameters can predict the vascularity of meningiomas., METHOD: We acquired DECT and perfusion CT (PCT) images in 24 patients with histologically diagnosed meningioma. Regions of interest (ROIs) were placed at the tumor in iodine, ED, and Zeff maps derived from DECT and in a blood volume (BV) map derived from PCT. To normalize these parameters' values, we divided them by the values of contralateral normal-appearing white matter, i.e., the relative (r)ED, rZeff, and rBV. The vascular density of the tumor specimens was immunohistochemically analyzed by calculating the von Willebrand factor-positive vessel wall. We calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients to determine the correlation with PCT/DECT parameters and an immunohistopathological index., RESULTS: Contrast rZeff (r = 0.7020, p = 0.0001) and iodine (r = 0.5814, p = 0.0029) both had positive correlations with rBV derived from PCT. The rED values were negatively correlated with the rBV values (r = -0.4735, p = 0.0194), and the vascular density results confirmed positive correlations with rBV (r = 0.6909, p = 0.0002) and contrast rZeff (r = 0.4982, p = 0.0132) and a negative correlation with rED (r = -0.4265, p = 0.0377). Regarding the radiation exposure, the mean estimated volume CT dose index (CTDIvol) of DECT was 33.1 +/- 1.72 mGy, much lower than that of PCT (103.3 +/- 4.65 mGy)., CONCLUSIONS: DECT predicted vascular density with lower radiation exposure compared to PCT. DECT could potentially replace PCT for evaluating the vascularity of meningiomas. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
2156,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, ~25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
312,"Characteristics of photopheresis treatments for the management of rejection in heart and lung transplant recipients Photopheresis has been used in the management of rejection of heart and/or lung transplants. Although its mechanism of action remains unknown, irradiated T-helper cell-induced immunosuppression is the main theory. Since transplant recipients are often lymphopenic and lymphocytes are the target cells in photo-therapy, we performed this study to determine which factors affect the cellular yield to undergo irradiation. We reviewed the records of all photophereses performed in our institution between July 1998 and April 2000 using the UVAR (first generation) or XTS (second generation) instruments (Therakos, Exton, PA). Our data included patient's blood volume, absolute lymphocyte count and hematocrit, catheter type, flow rate of collection cycles and centrifuge bowl size, as well as volume, hematocrit, and lymphocyte count of the cell suspension. With a mixed model multivariate analysis we sought to determine which variables predicted the lymphocyte yield. A total of 406 procedures in 25 adult patients was analyzed. There was no significant difference between the lymphocyte yield among the procedures performed with the first- and the second-generation instruments. The patient's absolute lymphocyte count was the only parameter, which positively correlated with the total number of lymphocytes collected for irradiation (P < 0.0001). Indeed, based on the mixed model, the total number of lymphocytes for irradiation can be predicted from the pre-procedure lymphocyte count. Additional studies are necessary to correlate the number of treated cells with patient outcome. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
3405,"Guided Punctures with Ultrasound Volume Navigation in Percutaneous Transforaminal Endoscopic Discectomy: A Technical Note Objective: Ultrasound volume navigation (UVN) has been widely used for accurate guidance and decreased radiation exposure. However, few studies have focused on the clinical significance of UVN in guiding percutaneous puncture in percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED). We evaluated UVN to guide percutaneous puncture in PTED. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 12 patients (8 men and 4 women), who had undergone PTED with the help of UVN or fluoroscopic guidance for lumbar disc herniation from November 2017 to December 2017. Result(s): The age of these 12 patients range was 26-71 years, and the body mass index range was 18.19-26.91 kg/m2. Of the 12 patients, 6 were in UVN group and 6 were in fluoroscopy group. The mean number of punctures was 1.00 in UVN group and 3.83 in fluoroscopy group. The mean exposure time was 3.60 and 13.80 seconds in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. The mean operation time was 48.17 minutes and 61.33 minutes in UVN and fluoroscopy groups, respectively. A positive relationship was found between operation time and exposure time (P < 0.05). All patients achieved excellent or good clinical outcomes. The Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scales for leg pain and back pain all showed significant improvement after the procedure (P < 0.05). None of patients experienced a complication. Conclusion(s): UVN decreased the number of puncture attempts, radiation exposure, and operation time compared with fluoroscopic guidance in PTED. Therefore, UVN is a feasible and efficient method for guiding percutaneous puncture in PTED.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2352,"Risk of covid-19 infection of a bariatric surgery cohort at the beginning of the pandemic Background: Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19. The first case in New York was reported in March 1st, 2020 but it is believed that the virus was already spreading during the prior months. In our institution, bariatric surgery was carried out as usual until March 18th, at which time 92 cases of COVID-19 were already admitted. We believe that bariatric patients could have been exposed to COVID-19 during this overlap and sought to evaluate incidence of infection among this high-risk cohort at our institution. We sought to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing bariatric surgery during the preceding months of the pandemic. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study from a single major bariatric center in the Bronx, New York. Patients who underwent bariatric surgery from January to March 2020 were included. Medical records were assessed looking COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis. Additionally, phone interviews were made looking for COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis outside our institution after the index operation. Result(s): A total of 203 patients were included. Eleven patients (5.4%) had post-op symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Of those, 2 tested positive, 1 tested negative, 1 was diagnosed with X-ray findings, 6 were not tested and 1 had an alternate diagnosis. Additionally, 6 patients were tested negative without symptoms for different reasons. None of the patients identified had a severe disease.

672,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded

After a detailed and systematic study of configuration-interaction effects in both the target and the collision wavefunctions, it was found that an additional 21 configurations needed to be included in the CI expansion to obtain significantly more accurate target state and collision wavefunctions. A total of 1785 individual lines are considered over a wide range of electron temperatures, 30-100 000 K, of particular importance in astrophysical applications. A detailed comparison is made with a previous 3 configuration approximation and significant differences of up to a factor of 2 are reported at the lowest temperatures considered. The inclusion of the additional 3d54s2 and 3d54s4p levels in the present work together with the additional CI effects are found to cause significant changes to the total effective collision strengths for the low-lying transitions from the ground state, particularly at very low temperatures. The disparities are found to be considerably less at the higher temperatures considered. 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd.",Excluded

924,"Quantification of coronary artery calcium on the basis of dual-energy coronary CT angiography PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of using virtual noncontrast material-enhanced (VNC) computed tomographic (CT) series derived from dual-energy CT imaging studies for coronary artery calcium quantification., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This HIPAA-compliant study was institutional review board approved; all patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-six patients prospectively underwent noncontrast-enhanced CT calcium scoring followed by coronary CT angiography performed in dual-energy mode. By using different reconstruction algorithms, three VNC series were generated and evaluated for noise and efficiency of virtual iodine removal. Two readers independently quantified calcium on VNC images and true noncontrast-enhanced conventional calcium scoring series. A leave-one-out cross validation was used to assess the accuracy of calcium score prediction from VNC series by means of linear regression., RESULTS: CT value histograms of the VNC series closely resembled the profile in the true noncontrast-enhanced series. There was excellent correlation between calcium volumes on the VNC series and true noncontrast-enhanced series on a per-patient (r = 0.94, P < .001, n = 36) and per-vessel (r = 0.94, 0.91, and 0.92 for the three coronary arteries, all P < .001, n = 36 each) level. The ability of a linear regression model to predict actual calcium scores from calcium volumes on VNC series was excellent (r = 0.82). Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis rankings that were derived from the predicted calcium scores also showed excellent agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.909)., CONCLUSION: Coronary artery calcium identification and quantification based on dual-energy coronary CT angiographic studies may obviate the need for dedicated CT calcium scoring studies.

1815,"Spinal Cord Stimulator-Trial Lead Migration Study Objectives. Investigate whether percutaneous spinal cord stimulator (SCS) leads migrate significantly during a 3-day trial, and determine whether the skin anchoring method influences lead migration. Material and Methods. Twenty patients were prospectively enrolled. Ten leads were anchored with suture and tape and 10 were anchored with tape only. A standardized X-ray protocol of lead position was obtained immediately following lead placement and upon completion of the trial. Results. Using a standardized method, SCS leads were measured and movement was calculated. The average movement for leads anchored with tape only was 8.72mm (SD=5.77), inferiorly; while movement for leads anchored with suture and tape was 24.49mm (SD=11.3), inferiorly. A t-test revealed a significant difference between the groups (t=3.9, P=0.001). Conclusions. Percutaneous SCS trial electrodes migrate significantly, inferiorly, during a 3-day trial. Anchoring the trial electrodes to the skin with a suture and tape results in significantly greater inferior migration when compared with anchoring the lead with tape only.

3208,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986 Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
1296,"Delayed non-myeloablative irradiation after lung transplantation to induce allograft acceptance in a large animal model Purpose: Previously, we induced long term tolerance in animals that underwent perioperative irradiation and a donor-specific alloantigen infusion in our miniature swine lung transplantation model. Here, we delayed induction to improve its clinical applicability. Method(s): Left sided single lung transplantation from MHC mismatched male donors was performed in 11 female outbred minipigs. Group 1 (n= 5) received non-myeloablative irradiation (7 Gy thymus and 1,5 Gy whole body, IRR) 12 hours before transplantation and perioperative donor-specific splenocyte infusion (SpTx). Group 2 (n= 3) also received a perioperative SpTx, but underwent delayed irradiation 3 days after transplantation. Group 3 (n= 3) was also exposed to delayed IRR but did not receive a donor-specific SpTx. Immunosuppression was maintained for 28 days with tacrolimus and methylprednisolone. Peripheral blood chimerism was monitored by flow cytometry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): In group 1, three animals never rejected their grafts until elective sacrifice at postoperative days (POD) 800+, the other two showed rejection on POD 239 and 360. In group 2, median allograft survival was 92 days. Out of the third group, one animal showed rejection on POD 226, the other two are currently alive at POD 216 and 393. In all groups, chimerism was detectable 1 hour after reperfusion of the lung, and peaked 1 hour after SpTx in groups 1 and 2. Group 1 showed early leukocyte chimerism levels of up to 30%. Analysis of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells revealed a rising tendency in group 1, whereas groups 2 and 3 had decreasing levels of this T cell subpopulation after withdrawal of immunosuppression. Conclusion(s): Preoperative irradiation and perioperative SpTx had the potential to upregulate the frequency of putative regulatory CD4+CD25 high T cells. SpTx without preceding IRR seemed to rather upregulate the effector arm, than inducing Treg proliferation. Delayed IRR only may lead to prolonged allograft survival in all three animals. This unresponsiveness might be due to induced anergy.",Excluded

The extent to which host characteristics, including pigmentary phenotype and UV radiation exposure, contribute is unknown., Objective: To identify and validate independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT, including those associated with the transplant and the host., Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study analyzed a consecutive sample of alloHCT recipients from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (n = 872) and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio (n = 147). Participants from the Mayo Clinic were randomly allocated (2:1) into discovery (n = 581) and validation (n = 291) cohorts. Time to first keratinocyte carcinoma and information about transplant- and host-associated risk factors were extracted. A multivariate keratinocyte carcinoma risk model was created using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression model with P <= .05 for entry that incorporated all covariates that were individually statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 in the discovery cohort. The risk model was first internally validated using the Mayo Clinic validation cohort and then externally validated using the independent cohort of alloHCT recipients at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center.

Risk factors independently associated with keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT included age (hazard ratio [HR] per 10 years, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.21-2.42), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.20-5.09), clinically photodamaged skin (HR, 3.47; 95% CI, 1.87-6.41), and history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.41-5.91). Harrell concordance statistics were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.74-0.98) for internal and external validation of the keratinocyte carcinoma risk model, respectively., Conclusions and Relevance: This study found validated independent risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma after alloHCT that are enriched with host- compared with transplant-associated risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of assessing host-associated risk factors for keratinocyte carcinoma in patients eligible for alloHCT. Future studies should examine whether keratinocyte carcinoma risk stratification before alloHCT may inform long-term surveillance strategies.",Excluded
3348,"Ionizing Radiation Exposure in Patients with COVID-19: More than Needed OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the ionizing radiation exposure in patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which all patients presented with suggestive symptoms of COVID-19 were included. The study was carried out in a university-affiliated private hospital in Istanbul, Turkey. Biological radiation dose exposure (cumulative effective dose: CED) was evaluated in millisievert (mSv) units. RESULT(S): A total of 1410 patients were included in the study. Of all study subjects, 804 patients (57%) underwent only one chest computed tomography (CT) procedure. Six hundred and six patients (43%) had two or more chest CT procedures. Median CED was 6.02 (min-max:1.67-16.27) mSv. The number of patients who were exposed to <= 5 mSv were 149 (24.6%), whereas 457 patients (75.4%) were exposed to >5 mSv. CONCLUSION(S): The radiation exposure in COVID-19 patients seems unjustifiably high. Awareness should be increased as to the proper use of chest CT in COVID-19 as per to the society recommendations.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.

As a result, only single-fraction treatments of MEA-protected animals showed therapeutically favorable differential protection.",Excluded
3005,"Effects of low-level laser therapy on burning mouth syndrome To investigate low-level laser therapy (LLLT) applied to treat burning mouth syndrome (BMS). This prospective, comparative, partially blinded, single-centre, clinical trial of GaAlAs Laser, with 815 nm wavelength, included 44 BMS patients divided randomly into three groups: Group I (n = 16): GaAlAs laser 815 nm wavelength, 1 W output power, continuous emissions, 4 s, 4 J and fluence rate 133.3 J cm-2 ; Group II (n = 16): GaAlAs infrared laser, 815 nm wavelength, 1 W output power, continuous emissions, 6 s, 6 J and fluence rate 200 J cm-2 ; Group III (n = 12) placebo group, sham laser. All groups received a weekly dose for 4 weeks. Pain intensity was recorded using a 10-cm visual analogue scale; patients responded to the oral health impact profile (OHIP-14), xerostomia severity test and the hospital anxiety-depression scale (HAD). These assessments were performed at baseline, 2 and 4 weeks. LLLT decreased pain intensity and improved OHIP-14 scores significantly from baseline to 2 weeks in groups I and II compared with the placebo group. No statistically significant differences were found from 2 to 4 weeks. Overall improvements in visual analogue scale (VAS) scores from baseline to the end of treatment were as follows: Group I 15.7%; Group II 15.6%; Group III placebo 7.3%.

1254,"Kinetic Imaging in Lower Extremity Arteriography: Comparison to Digital Subtraction Angiography Purpose To compare the image quality produced by kinetic imaging in x-ray angiography and the current reference standard digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Materials and Methods This prospective observational crossover study enrolled 42 patients undergoing lower limb x-ray angiography between February and June 2017 (mean age, 68.7 years; age range, 49-89 years; 32 men [mean age, 67.1 years; age range, 49-89 years] and 10 women [mean age, 75 years; age range, 57-85 years]). Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of DSA and kinetic image pairs were compared. Visual quality comparisons were also performed by specialists who used an online questionnaire. Interrater agreement was characterized by percent agreement and Fleiss k. Results A total of 1902 regions of interest were carefully selected in 110 image pairs to calculate and compare the SNRs. Median SNR in raw kinetic images was 3.3-fold and 2.3-fold higher than raw and postprocessed DSA images, respectively. A total of 232 pairs of raw and postprocessed kinetic images were compared. It was indicated that postprocessing improved the quality of kinetic images in 63.9% (2668 of 4176) of the comparisons. Interrater agreement was 75% and Fleiss k was 0.12 (P < .001). Also, 238 pairs of kinetic and DSA images were compared. Kinetic imaging was judged to have provided higher quality images than DSA in 69.0% (2462 of 3570) of the comparisons. The interrater agreement was 81% and Fleiss k was 0.17 (P < .001). Conclusion Kinetic imaging helps to view the same structures as digital subtraction angiography but offers better image quality. The improved signal-to-noise ratio suggests that this approach could reduce radiation exposure and improve the ability to view smaller vessels. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",Excluded
3060,"Ocular toxicity after 3D-conformal radiotherapy for non-hodgkin orbital lymphoma Purpose: The orbital Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a rare malignancy, usually localized and low aggressive, which management requires the irradiation of whole orbital cavity. This involves structures, as lens, particularly sensible to radiation effects. This single institution study wants to evaluate the acute and late siDe effects of conformal 3D irradiation for primary NHL. Materials: We retrospectively evaluated 59 consecutive patients (20 women and 39 men, mean age 59 +/- 16 yrs) with stage IEA NHL from 1986 to 2010. The disease was localized in the left eye in 34 (58%) patients, in the right in 21 (35%), bilateral in 4 (7%), and involved the orbit in 30 (51%), the conjunctiva in 18 (31%) and other orbital structures in 11 (18%). All patients underwent 3D-conformal radiotherapy after diagnosis (by pathological or cytological examination), staging (haematological tests, total body CT, bone marrow biopsy, orbital CT or MR) and in 4 cases after chemotherapy. The median dose was 30.6 Gy (range 30-40 Gy) with a standard fractioning (1.8 Gy per day) and the PTV consisted of whole orbital cavity. The bolus (thickness 0.5-1 cm) was used only in case of superficial localizations (25%). We described acute and late toxicity incidence and calculated the risk factors for cataract, using chi-square or Fisher test as appropriate. Result(s): The mean follow up was 68.3 +/- 55 months. It was performed by clinical and radiological examinations (total body CT, lymphatic stations US) and by ophthalmic visits, every 46 months during the first 5 years and then once a year. The local control was obtained in 58 (98.3%) patients. According to the RTOG scale, the graDe (G) 1 and 2 acute effects were 37% and 24% respectively, no G3-4 were observed in 39%. Thirty-six (61%) patients had no late toxicity, 22(37%) presented low effects (G1-2) and only 1 (2%) had retinopathy and bilateral cataract (G3). The table 1 reports the adverse effects. The cataract developed in 20 (34%) patients 2-7 yrs after radiotherapy was the more common late effect. It was easily treated by surgery. We considered as possible risk factors for cataract: age >60 yrs, Karnofsky performance status < 90%, total dose > 30.6 Gy, use of bolus and chemotherapy association. Total dose > 30.6 Gy resulted significantly associated (p<0.005). Cataract was developed in 13 of 24 patients (54%) treated with dose >30.6 (median 36 Gy), in 7 of 35 (20%) with dose <= 30.6. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): 3D conformal radiotherapy was effective and well tolerated, with low-graDe acute and late toxicity, for patients with orbital lymphoma. Cataract was the more frequent siDe effect, it was associated with a total dose > 30.6 Gy and easily treated with surgery. Eyesight was well preserved.",Excluded
2859,"Efficacy of model-based iterative reconstruction technique in non-enhanced CT of the renal tracts for ureteric calculi The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR), statistical iterative reconstruction (SIR), and filtered back projection (FBP) image reconstruction algorithms in the delineation of ureters and overall image quality on non-enhanced computed tomography of the renal tracts (NECT-KUB). This was a prospective study of 40 adult patients who underwent NECT-KUB for investigation of ureteric colic. Images were reconstructed using FBP, SIR, and MBIR techniques and individually and randomly assessed by two blinded radiologists. Parameters measured were overall image quality, presence of ureteric calculus, presence of hydronephrosis or hydroureters, image quality of each ureteric segment, total length of ureters unable to be visualized, attenuation values of image noise, and retroperitoneal fat content for each patient. There were no diagnostic discrepancies between image reconstruction modalities for urolithiasis. Overall image qualities and for each ureteric segment were superior using MBIR (67.5 % rated as 'Good to Excellent' vs. 25 % in SIR and 2.5 % in FBP). The lengths of non-visualized ureteric segments were shortest using MBIR (55.0 % measured 'less than 5 cm' vs. ASIR 33.8 % and FBP 10 %). MBIR was able to reduce overall image noise by up to 49.36 % over SIR and 71.02 % over FBP.

In addition, five males and five females were treated in a similar fashion, but were exposed to sham conditions. For each subject, a blood sample was obtained prior to the exposure period and aliquots were used as negative- (pre-exposure) and positive- [1.5 Gray (Gy) (60)Cobalt ((60)Co) gamma-irradiation] controls. At the end of the 4 h exposure period, a second blood sample was obtained. The extent of DNA damage was assessed in peripheral human blood leukocytes from all samples using the alkaline comet assay. To detect possible clastogenic effects, the incidence of micronuclei was assessed in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay., RESULTS: There was no evidence of either increased DNA damage, as indicated by the alkaline comet assay, or increased incidence of micronuclei (MN) in the magnetic field exposed group. However, an in vitro exposure of 1.5 Gy gamma-irradiation caused a significant increase in both DNA damage and MN induction., CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence that an acute, whole-body exposure to a 200 microT, 60 Hz magnetic field for 4 hours could cause DNA damage in human blood.",Excluded
2943,"Preoperative concurrent CAPOX radiotherapy in thai patients with locally advanced rectal cancer Introduction. The potential advantages of preoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer include pathological downstaging and reduced toxicity. Capecitabine and fluorouracil showed similar efficacy in preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. Capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin demonstrated efficacy for advanced colorectal cancer treatment. Methods. We conducted a phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of preoperative concurrent CAPOX radiotherapy in Thai patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Capecitabine 1650mg/m2 per day was taken on days 1-14 and 22-35 of radiotherapy. Oxaliplatin 50mg/m2 was administered on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of radiotherapy. The radiation dose to the pelvis was 45 Gy/25 fractions with a boost dose of 5.4 Gy/3 fractions. The total dose to the tumour bed was 50.4 Gy/28 fractions. Clinical response was evaluated by MRI prior to surgery. Patients underwent surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The endpoints of this study were clinical response, pathological response, and toxicities. Results. Twenty patients have been enrolled. Median age was 59.5 years (range 37-72). Male:female ratio was 1.22:1. All patients had clinical T3 N positive disease except one who hadT4 disease. After receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, severe toxicities (diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia,and neuropathy) were found in four patients (20%). One patient refused surgery after preoperative treatment. Response rate was evaluated in 18 patients. Clinical response rate was 83.4% (cCR 55.6%). Pathological response rate was 70.6% (pCR 5.9%). Eleven patients had microscopic residual disease. Most patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients developed recurrent disease and finally died. Discussion. Neoadjuvant concurrent capecitabine-oxaliplatin radiotherapy in Thai patients with locally advanced rectal cancer demonstrated excellent response rate and tolerable toxicities.",Excluded
2472,"Intravenous contrast agent influence on thoracic computed tomography simulation investigated through a heterogeneous dose calculation method using 5-Bulk densities Objective: Using 5-bulk-density heterogeneous dose calculation, we investigated whether contrast-enhanced (CE+) computed tomography (CT) will affect dose-calculation accuracy in the thoracic area. Method(s): We analyzed 17 radiation-oncology patients who underwent thoracic CE+ CTs. Full-resolution CT and 5-bulk-density plans were generated using an adaptive convolution algorithm. Bulk densities for air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone were applied to regions identified by an isodensity segmentation tool. The population-averaged physical density of each region was calculated and compared with the reference value calculated from 66 noncontrast-enhanced (CE-) thoracic CT images. Using the 5-bulk densities, we created a new plan in which the physical densities of each area were forced to be the same as the CE- reference value, and we compared the dose-volume histograms (DVH). Result(s): Average physical density for the segmented air, lung, fat, soft tissue, and bone for CE+ were 0.14, 0.29, 0.90, 1.03, and 1.13 g/cm3, and the reference values for CE- were 0.14, 0.26, 0.89, 1.02, and 1.12 g/cm3, respectively. In all the cases, the normal-tissue DVH agreed to better than 1%. In 15 cases, DVH of the planning target volume (PTV) agreed to better than 3%. In 2 patients, >3% difference in the PTV dose was observed. Conclusion(s): Only 2 patients with a strong injection artifact in the PTV or beam showed >3% discrepancy in the target dose.

492,"Case-control study on radiology work, medical x-ray investigations, and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors CONTEXT: Ionizing radiation is a well-established risk factor for brain tumors. During recent years, microwave exposure from the use of cellular telephones has been discussed as a potential risk factor., OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for brain tumors., DESIGN: A case-control study, with exposure assessed by questionnaires., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 233 currently living men and women, aged 20 to 80 years, were included. The case patients had histopathologically verified brain tumors and lived in the Uppsala-Orebro region (1994-1996) or the Stockholm region (1995-1996). Two matched controls to each case were selected from the Swedish Population Register., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ionizing radiation and use of cellular telephones as risk factors for brain tumors., RESULTS: A total of 209 cases (90%) and 425 controls (91%) answered the questionnaire. Work as a physician yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 6.00, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.62 to 57.7. All three case patients had worked with fluoroscopy. Radiotherapy of the head and neck region yielded an OR of 3.61 (95% CI, 0.65-19.9). Medical diagnostic x-ray examination of the same area yielded an OR of 2.10 (95% CI, 1.25-3.53), with a tumor induction period of 5 years or more. Chemical industry work yielded an OR of 4.10 (95% CI, 1.25-13.4), and laboratory work yielded an OR of 3.21 (95% CI, 1.16-8.85). Ipsilateral use of cellular telephones increased the risk for tumors in the temporal, temporoparietal, and occipital lobes (OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.97-6.05), ie, the anatomic areas with highest exposure to microwaves from a mobile telephone. The result was further strengthened (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.02-6.71) in a multivariate analysis that included laboratory work and medical diagnostic x-ray investigations of the head and neck., CONCLUSION: Exposure to ionizing radiation, work in laboratories, and work in the chemical industry increased the risk of brain tumors.

3342,"Retrospective study of immediate postoperative electron radiotherapy for therapy-resistant earlobe keloids Keloid resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy is the most efficacious treatment for keloids. However, for earlobe keloids, an optimal protocol for the total dose and fractions of adjuvant radiation has not yet been established. We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of immediate three-fraction electron radiotherapy after operation for resistant earlobe keloids. From 2011 to 2017, three-fraction electron radiotherapy with single dose of 5 Gy was given postoperatively to 23 patients with 30 keloids in our hospital. The first fraction of adjuvant radiotherapy was administered within 2 h of surgery, and the other two sessions were completed within the next day or two. Five (16.7%) primary keloids and 25 (83.3%) recurrent keloids were examined in this study. The primary endpoint was the local control rate, which was 86.7% after a median follow-up of 26 months (14-93 months). Secondary endpoints were acute and late procedure-related complications, and no severe complications were observed after combination therapy. Our results suggest that three-fraction electron radiotherapy after excision within 2 days of surgery is a safe and effective protocol for the prevention of earlobe keloid recurrence that can also improve patient compliance and comfort.Copyright © 2019, The Author(s).",Excluded
168,"Optimal adjuvant radiotherapy dose for stage I, II or III Merkel cell carcinoma: an analysis of the National Cancer Database BACKGROUND: We performed an analysis of the National Cancer Database to determine optimal doses of conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with stage I/II or III Merkel cell carcinoma., METHODS: The cohort included 2735 patients with resected Merkel cell carcinoma of the head and neck, trunk or extremities receiving radiotherapy. Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy. Doses < 50.0 Gy for stage III Merkel cell carcinoma were associated with worsened 3-year overall survival (P < 0.0001) and increased hazard of death (2.01, confidence interval 1.43-2.82) with respect to doses between 50.0 and 57.0 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support doses of 50-57 Gy for most patients with stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma receiving conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy. In contrast to a prior National Cancer Database analysis, our results suggest doses >= 50 Gy should be strongly considered for patients with stage III Merkel cell carcinoma regardless of anatomic subsite.

735,"Waiting times for radiotherapy: variation over time and between cancer networks in southeast England The aim of this study was to investigate variations in the length of time that patients with cancer wait from diagnosis to treatment with radiotherapy. A total of 57,426 men and 71,018 women diagnosed with cancer between 1992 and 2001 and receiving radiotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis were identified from the Thames Cancer Registry database. In total, 12 sites were identified for which a substantial number or proportion of patients received radiotherapy: head and neck, oesophagus, colon, rectum, lung, nonmelanoma skin cancer, breast, uterus, prostate, bladder, brain and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Median waiting times from diagnosis to radiotherapy were calculated, together with the proportion of patients who received radiotherapy within 60 days of diagnosis, and analysed by year of diagnosis, cancer site, deprivation quintile, age at diagnosis, sex and cancer network of either residence or treatment. Logistic regression was used to adjust the proportion receiving treatment within 60 days for the effects of the other factors. There were significant differences in the proportions receiving radiotherapy within 60 days between different networks and different cancer sites, which remained after adjustment. Median waiting times varied from 42 to 65 days across networks of residence, with the adjusted proportion treated within 60 days ranging from 44 to 71%. There was no difference between male and female patients after adjustment for the other factors, particularly site. There was a highly significant trend over time: the median wait increased from 45 days in 1992 to 76 days in 2001, while the adjusted proportion being treated within 60 days declined by almost a half, from 64 to 35%, over the same period.",Excluded
3033,"Treatment response in glass vs resin radioembolization of nonresectable hepatic metastasis Purpose: To compare treatment response between glass and resin yttrium-90 (90Y) microsphere radioembolization of hepatic metastasis from colorectal and other systemic malignancies. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis was performed on 70 patients with hepatic metastasis treated with glass or resin 90Y radioembolization from 2008 to 2014 at an academic medical center. Up to 2 treated lesions per lobe were measured using cross-sectional imaging in the X, Y, and Z planes at baseline and at 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month intervals. Response was evaluated using the World Health Organization (WHO) and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. Result(s): A total of 70 patients were evaluated with 39 (56%) receiving resin and 31 (44%) receiving glass particles. Of those, 34 (49%) patients had metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with a mean MELD score of 8.5 (SD 2.1), and 36 (51%) had other primary malignancies with a mean MELD score of 7.7 (SD 1.7). Thirty-seven (53%) patients were female with a mean age of 59.7 years (SD 12.3) at treatment 1. Patients received an average radiation dose of 1.12 gigabecquerel (GBq) (SD 0.33) with resin treatments, compared to 3.08 GBq (SD 1.09) with glass treatments. Evaluation of (Table presented) tumor response using WHO criteria found 1 (2.6%) patient had a complete response (CR), 13 (33.3%) had partial responses (PR), 19 (48.7%) had stable disease (SD), and 6 (15.4%) had progressive disease (PD) when treated with resin particles, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 5 (16.1%) had PR, 21 (67.7%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass particles. RECIST 1.1 response criteria demonstrated 1 (2.6%) patient had CR, 13 (33.3%) had PR, 18 (46.2%) had SD, and 7 (17.9%) had PD when treated with resin, and 0 (0.0%) had CR, 7 (22.6%) had PR, 19 (61.3%) had SD, and 5 (16.1%) had PD when treated with glass (Table 1). Due to small sample sizes, we were unable to perform formal significance testing on the distribution of response by treatment type. Conclusion(s): Although both glass and resin 90Y microspheres are efficacious treatments for nonresectable metastatic hepatic disease, there is limited data on direct comparison of imaging response between the 2 treatment types. Our study demonstrates that resin-based 90Y therapy offers a comparable response when compared to glassbased 90Y therapy at nearly one-third the dose of radiation.",Excluded

1947,"T1/T2 matching to differentiate tumor growth from radiation effects after stereotactic radiosurgery Objective: We define magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical criteria that differentiate radiation effect (RE) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Method(s): We correlated postoperative imaging and histopathological data in 68 patients who underwent delayed resection of a brain metastasis after SRS. Surgical resection was required in these patients because of clinical and imaging evidence of lesion progression 0.3 to 27.7 months after SRS. At the time of SRS, the median target volume was 7.1 mL (range, 0.5-26 mL), which increased to 14 mL (range, 1.3-81 mL) at the time of surgery. After initial SRS, routine contrast-enhanced MRI was used to assess tumor response and to detect potential adverse radiation effects. We retrospectively correlated these serial MRIs with the postoperative histopathology to determine if any routine MRI features might differentiate tumor progression from RE. Result(s): The median time from SRS to surgical resection was 6.9 months (range, 0.3-27.7 months). A shorter interval from SRS to resection was associated with a higher rate of tumor recurrence (P = .014). A correspondence between the contrast-enhanced volume on T1-weighted images and the low signal-defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images (""T1/T2 match"") was associated with tumor progression at histopathology (P < .0001). Lack of a clear and defined lesion margin on T2-weighted images compared to the margin of contrast uptake on T1-weighted images (""T1/T2 mismatch"") was significantly associated with a higher rate of RE in pathological specimens (P < .0001). The sensitivity of the T1/T2 mismatch in identifying RE was 83.3%, and the specificity was 91.1%. Conclusion(s): We found that time to progression and T1/T2 mismatch were able to differentiate tumor progression from RE in most patients. When REs are suspected, surgery may not be necessary if patients respond to conservative measures. When tumor progression is suspected, resection or repeat radiosurgery can be effective, depending on the degree of mass effect. © 2010 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.",Excluded
720,"Is lateral opening of the cup related to pelvic tilt on the surgical table? Introduction: Surgical table and floor are the usual references for positioning the cup. This is correct if pelvis is perpendicular to them (tilt 0degree). But if shoulder girdle is wider than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the feet. And if shoulder girdle is narrower than pelvic girdle, pelvis will be tilted towards the head. Objective(s): To analyse pelvic tilt on surgical table ant its influence on lateral opening of the cup. Method(s): Prospective, blind, observational study. Fifty THA patients (26 female), 1 department, multiple surgeons. Lateral decubitus, horizontal surgical table, conventional anterior (pubic) and posterior (lumbar spine) supports. Preoperative measures: (with custom-made measuring device) width of shoulder and pelvic girdles, pelvic tilt (angle between horizontal surgical table and a line by both antero-superior iliac spines), pelvic tilt towards head or feet. Postero-lateral approach. Theoretical position of cup intended by surgeons: 45degree valgus. Post-surgical x-ray: measure of lateral opening of cup. Result(s): 21/50 (4 males): pelvic girdle 27 mm wider than shoulder girdle (female phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 7degree towards head, theoretical risk of horizontal cup. Radiographic lateral opening of the cup: 43 +/- 10degree. 3/50 (2 males): pelvic girdle width similar to shoulder girdle, pelvic tilt 7 +/- 2degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 43.8degree. 26/50 (18 males): shoulder girdle 23 mm wider than pelvis (male phenotype), pelvic tilt 1 +/- 5degree towards feet, theoretical risk of vertical cup. Radiographic valgus of cup: 45 +/- 9degree. No result is statistically significant. Conclusion(s): 1) Different widths of shoulder and pelvic girdles could theoretically influence pelvic tilt of patients in lateral decubitus on surgical table. 2) But actually most patients present a minor pelvic tilt. 3) The average radiographic valgus of cups is near 45degree, but the standard deviation is great and an important number is out of recommended range.",Excluded
3069,"A single-institution phase I feasibility study of dose-escalated IMRT for non-operative locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background and purpose: Radiation dose escalation to improve poor outcomes with chemoradiation in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is limited in part by increased toxicity. This Phase I study investigates the use of IMRT to improve tolerability of dose escalation. Material(s) and Method(s): A single-institution, prospective study was conducted between 2007 and 2013 for individuals with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. Gross disease received 60 Gy in 30 fractions and at-risk sites received 54 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost. Concurrent chemotherapy primarily consisted of cisplatin/5-FU. The primary objective was to assess feasibility (<15% rate of grade 4-5 toxicity). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrence. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were enrolled with median follow up of 17.6 months (range 0.1 to 152.0). The majority were AJCC 7th edition Stage III (54%), distal esophagus primary (81%), and adenocarcinoma histology (85%). Twenty-one patients (81%) completed their course of radiation therapy, while only 55% received 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin/5-FU. One grade 5 and one grade 4 cardiac event occurred, both during chemoradiation and before receiving 50 Gy. The 3-year OS was 48.6% (95% CI: 32.5 to 72.2%) and PFS was 28.5% (95% CI: 14.6 to 55.5%). Half developed distant failure with LRR occurring in 10 patients (38%), isolated in 5 patients. Conclusion(s): While feasibility was demonstrated, toxicity and compliance remained limiting factors with outcomes similar to historical controls. There remains an uncertain role for dose escalation in definitive management of locally advanced esophageal cancer.Copyright © 2021 The Author(s)",Excluded
1875,"Chemoradiotherapy and Increased Prescription Dose in Esophageal Squamous Cell Cancer: A Retrospective Study To analyze the outcomes and adverse events of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiation with modified radiotherapy volume and increased radiation dose. This was a retrospective analysis of patients with ESCC treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (02/2015 to 02/2017). The dose to the planning gross tumor volume (PGTV) and planning clinical tumor volume (PTV1) was 66-68 Gy (2.0-2.2 Gy/fraction). The dose to the planning regional lymph node drainage area volume (PTV2) was 46 Gy (2.0 Gy/fraction). Treatment response, adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and locoregional failure-free survival (LRFFS) were analyzed. Twenty-six patients were included. The median follow-up was 31 (range, 4.3-51.3) months. Sixteen (61.5%) patients had a complete response, and four (15.4%) achieved a partial response. The objective response rate was 76.9%, and the disease control rate was 80.8%. The median PFS and OS were not achieved. The 4-year PFS was 63.9%, and the 4-year OS was 71.0%. Grade 1-2 and 3-4 radiation-related esophagitis was observed in 15 (57.7%) and one (4.5%) patients, respectively. Grade 1-2 and 3-4 radiation-related pneumonitis was observed in 12 (46.2%) and one (4.5%) patients, respectively. No patients developed radiation-related heart or skin damage. The modified target volume definition and increased dose of definitive radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy in patients with ESCC had low toxicity and might improve survival, but additional trials are necessary to prove the superiority of this strategy.Copyright © 2021 Xiaofen Pan et al.",Excluded

1878,"[Technique and radiation dose of conventional X-rays and computed tomography of the sacroiliac joint] Anterior-posterior (a.p.) or posterior-anterior X-rays of the sacroiliac joint, sometimes supplemented by a transverse view, have been the method of choice for diagnosis of patients suspected of having sacroiliitis. The sensitivity and specificity of conventional X-rays are relatively low, which can delay the diagnosis of sacroiliitis. Computed tomography (CT) is superior to conventional X-rays for diagnosis of sacroiliitis, but does emit a relatively higher dose of radiation. For this reason, particularly for females, CT should be optimized by employing semi-coronal planes which require a lower radiation dose than axial planes. CT in a semi-coronal plane causes minimal radiation to the ovaries, and the effective radiation dose for women might even be lower than with conventional AP X-rays. Therefore, for suspected sacroiliitis in young women, CT in the semi-coronal plane is the preferred imaging method with respect to diagnostics and radiation protection when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not available. Male gonads can be protected from radiation doses in conventional X-rays, and CT as the primary imaging method can only be justified in these cases because of its better diagnostic capabilities. Due to the lack of inherent risk factors, MRI is superior to CT for diagnostics since it provides images of inflammatory signs in addition to joint destruction. Thus, when available, MRI should be given preference for diagnosis of sacroiliitis.",Excluded
1551,"Factors affecting anxiety among administrative officers working within the urgent protective action planning zone of a nuclear power station The aim of this study was to clarify the factors affecting anxiety among administrative officers working within the urgent protective action planning zone of a nuclear power station to establish an effective education program on radiation and its health effects to help reduce anxiety in residents. We included 1,181 officers who worked at local authorities within the urgent protective action planning zone of Sendai Nuclear Power Station in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex (odds ratio = 2.33), working more than 21 years as an administrative officer (odds ratio = 1.49), lack of participation in training on nuclear disasters (odds ratio = 1.42), and not knowing the three principles of radiation protection (odds ratio = 1.36) were independently associated with anxiety among administrative officers working within the urgent protective action planning zone.

2527,"Ionizing radiation regulates the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in epithelial cancer cells: modulation of cellular signals regulating cell cycle and survival PURPOSE: To analyze the (i) expression of AMPK in a variety of epithelial cancer cells, (ii) regulation of AMPK subunit expression by ionizing radiation (IR) and (iii) impact of AMPK on signaling pathways regulating cell cycle and survival., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human lung, prostate, and breast normal and cancer cells were treated with 0 or 8 Gy IR and mRNA and protein levels of AMPK were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting 24 or 48 h later. Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKalpha(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR., RESULTS: AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays., CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKalpha knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.

216,"Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification (Astro-CHARM) Coronary Calcium Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk Calculator BACKGROUND: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a powerful novel risk indicator for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Currently, there is no available ASCVD risk prediction tool that integrates traditional risk factors and CAC., METHODS: To develop a CAC ASCVD risk tool for younger individuals in the general population, subjects aged 40 to 65 without prior cardiovascular disease from 3 population-based cohorts were included. Cox proportional hazards models were developed incorporating age, sex, systolic blood pressure, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension treatment, family history of myocardial infarction, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and CAC scores (Astro-CHARM model [Astronaut Cardiovascular Health and Risk Modification]) as dependent variables and ASCVD (nonfatal/fatal myocardial infarction or stroke) as the outcome. Model performance was assessed internally, and validated externally in a fourth cohort., RESULTS: The derivation study comprised 7382 individuals with a mean age 51 years, 45% women, and 55% nonwhite. The median CAC was 0 (25th, 75th [0,9]), and 304 ASCVD events occurred in a median 10.9 years of follow-up. The c-statistic was 0.784 for the risk factor model, and 0.817 for Astro-CHARM ( P<0.0001). In comparison with the risk factor model, the Astro-CHARM model resulted in integrated discrimination improvement (0.0252), and net reclassification improvement (0.121; P<0.0001), as well. The Astro-CHARM model demonstrated good discrimination (c=0.78) and calibration (Nam-D'Agostino chi2, 13.2; P=0.16) in the validation cohort (n=2057; 55 events). A mobile application and web-based tool were developed to facilitate clinical application of this tool ( www.AstroCHARM.org )., CONCLUSION: The Astro-CHARM tool is the first integrated ASCVD risk calculator to incorporate risk factors, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and family history, and CAC data. It improves risk prediction in comparison with traditional risk factor equations and could be useful in risk-based decision making for cardiovascular disease prevention in the middle-aged general population.",Excluded

Results were stratified on the basis of self-reported occupational exposure to procedures that involve radiation., RESULTS: There were 1,543 employees (mean age 43 +/- 11.3 years, 33% male) who responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), and 1,042 (67.5%) reported being involved with procedures utilizing radiation. These employees reported experiencing work-related pain more often than the control group before (54.7% vs. 44.7%; p < 0.001) and after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions, years in profession, and job description (odds ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.32 to 2.11; p < 0.001). Musculoskeletal pain varied significantly by job description, with the highest incidence reported by technicians (62%) and nurses (60%) followed by attending physicians (44%) and trainees (19%; p < 0.001). There was no difference in cancer prevalence between groups (9% vs. 9%; p = 0.96)., CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal pain is more common among healthcare workers who participate in interventional procedures and is highest in nonphysician employees. The diagnosis of cancer in employees who participate in procedures that utilize radiation was not elevated when compared to controls within the same departments, although any conclusion regarding causality is limited by the cross-sectional nature of the study, as well as the low overall prevalence of malignancy in our study group.

2934,"In vivo dosimetry during DSA of the carotid and renal arteries. Deriviation of local DRLs The Euratom directive 97/43 recommends the use of patient dose surveys in diagnostic radiology and the establishment of diagnostic reference dose levels (DRLs). The aims of this study are to perform measurements of the entrance surface dose (ESD) during diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the renal and carotid arteries using thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs), extraction of local DRLs, and calculation of the effective dose. Dose measurement for the staff was also performed. Dose measurements were performed on 48 participating patients. The mean effective dose was calculated to be 15.9 mSv and 8.9 mSv, for the renal and carotid DSA, respectively. The effective dose of the radiologist was calculated to be 0.022 mSv and 0.023 mSv per procedure for renal and carotid DSA respectively, when wearing a protective apron and using a movable ceiling mounted shield. Radiation dose variation depends on the physical characteristics of the patient, on the procedure preferences by radiologists and on the difficulties in conducting the procedures. The lack of DRLs for the specific examinations lead the research team to choose the DRL for DSA of the renal arteries to be 169 mGy for ESD at the pelvic region and for DSA of the carotid arteries to be 313 mGy for ESD at the region of the aortic arc.",Excluded
2763,"A comparison of leg length discrepancy with function and satisfaction scores after cemented total hip replacement Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side. There was no significant association between LLD and other independent variables.",Excluded

Six of the 8 subjects were able to tolerate 2 min at peak +2 Gz, 2-5 min at +3 Gz, and 1-2 min at +4 Gz. Heart rate (HR) at any given level of upright LBNP regularly exceeded supine levels. HR change at -50 mm Hg in upright subjects (+47.7 bpm from 74.1 +/- 1.9 (M +/- S.E.) bpm, control) was 2.6 times greater than in supine subjects (+18.3 bpm from 64.8 +/- 2.8 bpm, control).

1401,"Dose escalation of gemcitabine concomitant with radiation and cisplatin for nonsmall cell lung cancer: A phase 1-2 study BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to evaluate the maximum tolerable dose of weekly gemcitabine administered simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin in patients with locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHOD(S): Patients with stage IIIA/B NSCLC received concurrently 63 grays radiation and 20 mg/m2 cisplatin Day 1 to 3 in Weeks 1 and 5, plus weekly gemcitabine at escalating doses (150-700 mg/m2) on Fridays after radiation to avoid radiosensitization. The authors assessed dose-limiting toxicities according to Common Toxicity Criteria. The primary endpoint was maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of gemcitabine. Tumor resectability, survival, and disease-free survival (DFS) were also determined. RESULT(S): Forty-two patients were accrued, of whom 95% received radiation and 66% cisplatin as above. Weekly doses of gemcitabine were escalated to 700 mg/m 2. Grade 3 dysphagia and 1 case of fatal, probably treatment-related pulmonary deterioration established the MTD of gemcitabine at 550 mg/m2 weekly. Twenty-five patients underwent surgery, and histopathological complete regression was documented in 26% of these patients. Overall, median actuarial survival and DFS were 23.8 and 12.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSION(S): Gemcitabine at doses up to 550 mg/m2 weekly can be given simultaneously with radiation and cisplatin to patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Radical resection thereafter is feasible.

705,"Assessment of radiation-induced liver injury with computed tomography OBJECTIVE: To review the appearance of radiation-induced liver injury on computer tomography for quantitative assessment of dosimetric changes in different radiological reactions and the influence of time-effect. METHOD(S): The focal liver reactions of 35 patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) for liver malignancies were evaluated, with the applied doses of 36-65 Gy in 4-28 fractions completed in 8-41 days. All patients received nonenhanced CT scan and arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scan 1-6 months after therapy. The liver tissue density in irradiated and nonirradiated liver was compared, and the reaction type and the threshold dose determined radiologically. RESULT(S): On at least one follow-up examination, 51.4% of patients were found to have a focal radiation reaction in the liver. The radiation reaction was hypodense in 43.75% of the follow-up nonenhanced CT examinations and in 19.23% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. It was hyperdense in 42.31% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. The median threshold dose inducing a radiation reaction was 30.8 Gy (range 18-42.8 Gy). The detected threshold dose was positively correlated with the time of detection of the reaction (P=0.041), with a correlation coefficient of -0.473. On arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans, the threshold dose was significantly higher for hyperdense than for hypodense changes (P=0.017). In additional follow-up, the reaction volume decreased and the reaction types changed on arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. CONCLUSION(S): The threshold dose can be different in different radiological reaction types on multiphase CT scans. The detected threshold dose is inversely correlated with the time of detection of the early reaction. Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT is helpful to distinguish radiation reactions from recurrent tumors.",Excluded
3090,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded
2673,"Phase I dose-escalation study of endoscopic intratumoral injection of OBP-301 (Telomelysin) with radiotherapy in oesophageal cancer patients unfit for standard treatments PURPOSE: OBP-301 (Telomelysin) is an attenuated type-5 adenovirus that contains the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter to regulate viral replication. OBP-301 sensitises human cancer cells to ionising radiation by inhibiting DNA repair, and radiation enhances coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor-mediated OBP-301 infection on the contrary. We assessed OBP-301 with radiotherapy in oesophageal cancer patients unfit for standard chemoradiation treatments., METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study of OBP-301 with radiotherapy was conducted in 13 histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer patients deemed unfit to undergo surgery or chemotherapy. Study treatment consisted of OBP-301 administration by intratumoural needle injection using a flexible endoscope on days 1, 18 and 32. Radiotherapy was administered concurrently over 6 weeks, beginning on day 4, to a total of 60 Gy., RESULTS: Of the 13 patients, 7, 3 and 3 patients were treated with 1010, 1011 and 1012 virus particles, respectively. Study group comprised 10 males and 3 females, with a median age of 82 years (range, 53-91 years). All patients developed a transient, self-limited lymphopenia. Distribution studies revealed transient virus shedding in the plasma. Eight patients had local complete response (CR); all of them exhibited no pathologically viable malignant cells in biopsy specimens, and 3 patients had a partial response. The objective response rate was 91.7%. The clinical CR rate was 83.3% in stage I and 60.0% in stage II/III. Histopathological examination revealed massive infiltration of CD8+ cells and increased PD-L1 expression., CONCLUSION: Multiple courses of endoscopic intratumoural OBP-301 injection with radiotherapy are feasible and provide clinical benefits in patients with oesophageal cancer unfit for standard treatments.

Material(s) and Method(s): 320-row CTP was performed in 30 patients, and analyses were conducted independently by three different blinded readers by the use of two recent software releases (version 4.6 and novel version 4.71GR001, Toshiba, Tokyo, Japan). Analysis times were compared, and automated epi- and endocardial contour detection was subjectively rated in five categories (excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor). As semi-quantitative perfusion parameters, myocardial attenuation and transmural perfusion ratio (TPR) were calculated for each myocardial segment and agreement was tested by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Conventional coronary angiography served as reference standard. Result(s): The analysis time was significantly reduced with the novel automated software version as compared with the former release (Reader 1: 43:08 +/- 11:39 min vs. 09:47 +/- 04:51 min, Reader 2: 42:07 +/- 06:44 min vs. 09:42 +/- 02:50 min and Reader 3: 21:38 +/- 3:44 min vs. 07:34 +/- 02:12 min; p < 0.001 for all).

The purpose of this study was to examine effects of gamma radiation on Wolbachia and reproduction in Brugia malayi adult worms. Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included
1383,"Potential benefits and pitfalls of respiratory-gated radiotherapy in the treatment of thoracic malignancy Aim: Despite advances in radiotherapy delivery, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor. Higher doses of radiation have been associated with improved outcomes but may result in higher toxicities. Respiratory gated radiotherapy (RGRT) has the potential to reduce pulmonary toxicity but there are significant limitations and pitfalls to its use. The aim of this article is to (i) describe the RGRT technique currently employed at Nepean and Westmead Hospitals; (ii) discuss the practical issues of implementing such a program; (iii) present the results of our RGRT program and (iv) review the potential uncertainties in using this technique and the methods we have used to overcome these. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients who had a 4D-computed tomography (4D-CT) scan was undertaken. Records from treatment planning systems were used to assess the prospective gating program. Result(s): Between September 2007 and June 2011, 53 patients at Nepean and 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a 4D-CT. Between April and August 2011, 26 patients at Westmead Hospital underwent a prospective 4D-CT scan as treatment verification. Two of the 26 patients (7.7%) were found to have incomplete coverage of the planning target volume. Both patients underwent respiratory re-coaching, alleviating the need for replanning. Conclusion(s): RGRT may reduce doses to organs at risk with the potential for dose escalation. However its implementation requires significant staff training, treatment time and resources. Treatment verification with image guided radiation therapy are essential for safe delivery. © 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded

Background: Multidetector-row computed tomography is often used as a first-line test in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiovascular diseases including aortic dissection, coronary artery disease and pulmonary embolism. This study evaluated the impact of reducing the tube potential from 120 kVp to 100 kVp in a selected group of patients presenting to the Emergency Room with acute chest pain. The primary end point was how the reduction of radiation dose affected image quality. Method(s): The current study was performed over a period of 2 years between July, 2016 and July, 2018. This study included patients who presented to the Emergency Room or to an outpatient clinic and were suspected to have a coronary, a pulmonary (pulmonary embolism), or an aortic (aortic dissection) etiology. Suspicion was determined by the medical provider based on clinical picture, EKG, and lab results when available. All patients were referred for computed tomography angiography (CTA) testing as part of their diagnostic evaluation. A total of 84 patients were involved in the study. Seventy of the patients underwent the low acquisition Kvp technique (100 Kvp - Group I). In the remaining 14 patients, the standard acquisition technique (120-140 Kvp - Group II) was utilized. Result(s): This study showed the feasibility of using low energy CTA to significantly reduce the patient's radiation exposure without markedly affecting the image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion(s): The use of low energy CTA protocols in cases of acute chest pain revealed no major difference regarding the image quality with marked reduction of the radiation dose received by the patient.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2287,"Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of radiation-associated and sporadic meningiomas Ionizing irradiation to the skull is a known risk factor for meningioma development. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms that underlie radiation-associated meningioma (RAM), we characterized the somatic genetic alterations in 16 RAMs by using comparative genomic hybridization and compared the pattern of alterations with 17 nonradiation-associated meningiomas (non-RAM). Most tumors (29/33;87.9%) displayed at least one DNA copy number alteration, and 11 out of 33 (33%) exhibited four or more changes. The mean number of DNA copy number changes was similar in RAMs (2.4+/-1.9) and in non-RAMs (2.5+/-1.9). The most common DNA losses were noted in chromosome 22 (56.2% in RAM, and 47% in non-RAM) and chromosome 1 (37.5% in RAM and 35.3% in non-RAM), with no significant differences between the two groups. Noteworthy, gain in DNA copy number of chromosomes 8 and 12 was detected in two RAM tumors only. In conclusion, no significant differences were noted between RAMs and non-RAMs regarding the number of genetic changes and the extent and frequency of chromosomes 1 and 22 losses. These preliminary data suggest that the tumorogenic pathways of meningioma formation are similar, regardless of previous skull irradiation.",Included

1314,"Utility of cone beam computed tomography verification after stereoscopic kV localization in head and neck tumors treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for tumors of the head and neck is an emerging technique gaining popularity as literature regarding its efficacy and safety continues to grow. At our institution, we utilize an x-ray 6D image-guided radiation therapy system (combined infrared-based optical positioning and stereoscopic kV pair localization) for patient positioning followed by soft tissue verification with cone beam CT (CBCT). Here, we identify the magnitude of correction based on CBCT verification after stereoscopic kV pair localization for various anatomic sites of the head and neck and identify subsites in which planning target volume (PTV) margins may be reduced or CBCT may be eliminated. Materials/Methods: The retrospective record was reviewed for patients undergoing SBRT for head and neck tumors between the dates of 6/1/15 and 12/31/15. Patients who received intra-fraction image guidance by stereoscopic kV pair imaging followed by CBCT verification were identified. The magnitude and direction of applied shifts based on CBCT imaging in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions were recorded, from which the vector magnitude of each shift in three dimensions was calculated. Result(s): Thirty-three patients were treated with SBRT for head and neck pathology in the 6-month time period, of which 19 received stereoscopic kV pair localization followed by CBCT verification. For each of the 69 treatments delivered by this method, the vector magnitude was calculated for each shift. The average of these magnitudes was 1.77 mm >=1.75 mm (mean >= standard deviation). For skull base and cervical spine treatments (n = 41), the mean isocenter shift was 1.53 mm >= 1.41 mm, compared to 2.12 mm >= 2.12 mm for non-skull base, non-spine head and neck treatments (n = 28). Conclusion(s): Shifts based on soft tissue localization by CBCT after positioning by stereoscopic kV imaging were typically less than 2 mm for the head and neck treatments in this series, particularly in those treatments directed towards the skull base or cervical spine. For head and neck tumors treated with SBRT near bony anatomy, CBCT verification may not be necessary after stereoscopic kV localization provided that an additional 2 mm margin is added to the PTV in quadrature.",Excluded

To investigate whether it is possible to obtain adequate images at uniform image noise levels and reduced radiation exposure with our automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technique for 64-detector CT. The study population consisted of 64 patients with known or suspected lung or abdominal disease. We used a 64-detector CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a combined angular and longitudinal tube current modulation technique (Smart mA, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) to examine 34 patients. The scanning parameters were identical; the minimum and maximum tube current thresholds were 50 and 800 mA, respectively. For study of the constant tube current technique, 30 additional patients were examined at 350 mA. The CT number and image noise (SD of the CT number) were measured in the 64 patients at six levels, i.e., the center of the left ventricle, the liver dome, the porta hepatis, the center of the spleen and the right and left renal pelvis. When we used the ATCM technique, the mean image noise ranged from 8.40 at the center of the left ventricle to 11.31 at the porta hepatis; the mean tube current ranged from 105.9 mAs at the center of the left ventricle to 169.6 mAs at the center of the spleen.

Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed the records (April 1991 - May 2004) of patients with non-small-cell carcinoma, with no extrabronchial spread on computed tomography scans, who underwent HDR brachytherapy because of contraindications to surgery and external beam radiation therapy. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared by the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were analyzed by multivariate analysis. Result(s): 226 patients (223 men, 3 women, mean age: 62.2 years (range, 40-84)) were included. Of those, 217 (97%) had squamous cell carcinoma (Tis/T1/T2/Tx: 60/153/9/4). Dose was prescribed at 1 cm from the radius (24-35 Gy in 4-6 fractions). Mean follow-up was 30.4 months (range, 9-116). Complete endoscopic response rate was 93.6% at 3 months. One hundred twenty-eight patients (56%) died of intercurrent disease (n = 45), local failure (n = 36), metastasis (n = 10), local failure and metastasis (n = 11), complications (n = 13), and other causes (n = 12). The 2-year and 5-year survival rates were, respectively, 57% and 29% (overall) (median, 28.6 months), 81% and 56% (cancer-specific), and 68% and 50% (local disease-free). Acute toxicity included pneumothorax (1.5%) and mucosal inflammation (10%). Late complications were hemoptysis (6.6% with 5% of fatalities), bronchitis (19.5%), and necrosis (3.5%). In multivariate analysis, a distal tumor location and the use of two catheters were associated with improved local disease-free survival (p = 0.003 and p = 0.007, respectively) and a distal tumor location with improved overall survival (p = 0.0001).

2961,"Induction of high-frequency oscillations in a junction-coupled network Rhythmic oscillations of up to 600 Hz in grouped neurons frequently occur in the brains of animals. These high-frequency oscillations can be sustained in calcium-free conditions and may be blocked by gap junction blockers, implying a key role for electrical synapses in oscillation generation. Mathematical theories have been developed to demonstrate oscillations mediated by electrical synapses without chemical modulation; however, these models have not been verified in animals. Here we report that oscillations of up to 686 Hz are induced by paired spikes of short spike intervals (SIs) in a junction-coupled network. To initiate oscillations, it was essential that the second spike was elicited during the relative refractory period. The second spike suffered from slow propagation speed and failure to transmit through a low-conductance junction. Thus, at the spike initiation site, paired spikes of short SIs triggered one transjunctional spike in the postsynaptic neuron. At distant synaptic sites, two transjunctional spikes were produced as the SI increased during spike propagation. Consequently, spike collision of these asymmetrical transjunctional spikes occurred in the interconnected network. The remaining single spike reverberated in a network serving as an oscillator center. Paired-spike-induced oscillations were modeled by computer simulation and verified electrophysiologically in a network that mediates the tail-flip escape response of crayfish.",Excluded
3219,"An optimized test bolus for computed tomography pulmonary angiography and its application at 80kV with 10ml contrast agent Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is usually used for pulmonary embolism (PE) detection. However, the determination of scan timing remains a challenge due to the short scan duration of CTPA. We aimed to develop an optimized test bolus to determine scan delay in CTPA. The time-enhancement curves were obtained by measuring the enhancement within a region of interest in the main pulmonary artery and vein. A total of 70 patients were randomly divided into two groups (n=35 each): the control group underwent CTPA using the test bolus approach and the test group underwent CTPA using the biphasic time-enhancement curves approach. Tube voltages of 100 kVp and 80 kVp and 20ml and 10ml contrast agent were adopted in the control and test groups, respectively. The CT numbers, image quality, PE detection was evaluated. There was a point of intersection between the pulmonary artery and vein test bolus enhancement curves. The scan delay time (TDELAY) was obtained based on the time at intersection (TCROSS) and the scan duration (TSD): TDELAY=TCROSS - TSD. The mean CT numbers for pulmonary vein in the control were higher than those in the test group (all p<0.001). The image quality for the pulmonary arteries in the test group was better than that in the control group (p<0.01), with artifact reduction in the superior vena cava. Segmental PE could be detected using the optimized protocol. The radiation dose and iodine load in the test group were all lower than those in the control (p<0.01). We established an approach to calculate the scan delay of CTPA, and this approach could be used for CTPA at 80 kVp with 10ml contrast agent.",Excluded

Patients and Methods Patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC, performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were accrued in 2 strata, low- and high-risk (squamous histology, hemoptysis, tumor with cavitation and/or adjacent to a major vessel). Cohort 1 patients received cisplatin 50 mg/m2 days (d) 1 and 8, etoposide 50 mg/m2 (d 1-5) for 2 cycles concurrent with radiotherapy (64.8 Gy) followed by docetaxel (D) 75 mg/m2 and B 15 mg/kg for 3 cycles. If safety was established, then accrual would continue to cohort 2 (B, d 15, 36, 57) and then subsequently to cohort 3 (B, d 1, 22, 43). Results Twenty-nine patients (17 low- and 12 high-risk) registered to cohort 1. Twenty-six patients (including 4 squamous, 1 adenosquamous) were assessable. Twenty-five completed CRT. Grade 3/4 toxicities during CRT included acceptable rates of hematologic toxicity, esophagitis, and pneumonitis. Of 21 assessable for safety with D/B consolidation, major adverse events were pneumonitis (2 Grade 3) and 2 episodes of fatal hemoptysis in the high-risk group, resulting in closure of this stratum. The low-risk stratum subsequently closed because of slow accrual. Median overall survival was 46 months for low-risk and 17 months for high-risk strata. Conclusion Bevacizumab was not safely integrated into CRT for stage III NSCLC in patients considered at high risk for hemoptysis. In lower risk patients, data are insufficient to determine safety or efficacy.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded

To characterize the kinetics of recovery from pulmonary injury in long term survivors we collected data on 138 (78 male, 60 female) subjects surviving >5 years after SCT from their HLAmatched siblings. The median age at transplant was 36 years. Transplant indications were CML (63), AML (31), MDS (19), ALL (12) and others (14). 126 subjects received mu1200 cGy TBI-based conditioning with or without lung shielding, 3 received 400 cGy TBI-based conditioning and 9 patients received no irradiation. Ex vivo T cell depleted grafts were given to 131 recipients, except for six who received a nonmyeloablative SCT. Of the 138 long term survivors, 26 had no cGvHD, 70 had cGvHD lasting less than 3 years; and 42 had prolonged cGvHD requiring systemic immunosuppression for > 3 years. Among the 17 patients who died after 5 years, 4 died of pulmonary causes, including two with lung cancer. Pre-transplant abnormalities (< 80% predicted) in PFTs were found in 15.9% of subjects in the following declining frequency: FVC%, VC, TLC, FEV1, DLCO Adj (adjusted for hemoglobin and alveolar ventilation) Hb/VA and FEV1/FVC. Baseline (BL) PFTs served as the reference for all subsequent measurements at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years for each survivor. The only parameter showing a clinically significant decline post transplant was DLCO Adj which reached a nadir at 5 years, with subsequent normalization at the 10 year mark [paired ttest]. An abnormal (<80% of baseline) DLCO Adj was found in 19.6, 21.0, 0.7 and 0% of survivors at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years. The mean DLCO Adj at 3, 5, 10 and 15 years were 91% (P = .003), 88% (P < .001), 98% (p=NS) and 100% (p=NS) of BL, respectively. Multivariable modeling (forward-stepwise multiple regression) identified the presence of chronic GVHD (P = .017) and abnormal Baseline DLCO Adj (P = .023) as the only significant factors associated with the decline in DLCO Adj at 5 years but excluded smoking, conditioning intensity, baseline C-reactive protein level, TBI dose to the lungs and demographic variables. In conclusion, DLCO Adj is the only PFT marker associated with pulmonary injury in our TBI-conditioned transplant population. DLCO Adj nadirs at 5 years post-SCT, and normalizes by 10 years. Chronic GVHD and pre-transplant DLCO Adj are important contributory factors to the decline in DLCO Adj. (Figure presented).",Excluded

Method(s): Eight patients with stage III NSCLC who were candidated for 3DCRT were enrolled. All the patients had PET-CT scans and SPECT scans. The imagings were accurately co-registered in the planning system. The PET-CT images were used to define the gross tumor volume, and the SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused ""functioning"" lung (FL). The planning objective was to minimize the dose to FL. Statistical analysis was made for the difference between the two sets of 3DCRT plans. Result(s): After 3DCRT was optimized, both the percentage of whole lung volume received dose >=xGy (WLVx) and the percentage of functional lung volume received dose >=xGy (FLVx) were decreased.

The dose delivered was 45 Gy (1.80 Gy per fraction) in IMRT technique. Concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy at 225 mg/m(2) was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. Primary endpoints were acute gastrointestinal toxicity (CTC 4.0) and technical feasibility of IMRT in regard to dose planning and radiation delivery., RESULTS: Early acute events were defined as clinical and chemical adverse effects of IMRT and concurrent chemotherapy during treatment. By definition, 90 days after the end of IMRT has been evaluated as acute-phase toxicity. No patient had grade 4 or higher acute adverse events. Clinical grade 3 toxicity occurred in two patients (8%) with diarrhea and in one case (4%) with nausea. Hematological changes with grade 3 occurred in three cases (12%) with hemoglobin decrease, in five cases (25%) as leukopenia, and in one case (4%) with thrombocytopenia. The mean dose for liver was 16 Gy and the percentage volume exceeding 30 Gy (V30) was 21%. Mean dose for right and left kidney was 9 and 13 Gy, respectively, and V20 was 9% and 13%, respectively. Heart received a median dose of 15 Gy and V40 was 17%. The mean dose to the bowel was 11 Gy and V40 was 6%. Spinal cord had at maximum 33 Gy in median. Specifics of dose distribution, including the coverage, for the target region were as follows: minimum was 33 Gy, maximum 48.6 Gy, and mean dose 44.6 Gy. The prescribed dose (45 Gy) covered 99% and 95% of planning target volume (OTV) in 66% and 92% of cases, respectively. Median PTV was 15.77 ml (range, 805-3,604 ml)., CONCLUSIONS: The data support the practical feasibility of IMRT in adjuvant treatment in high-risk gastric cancer in the postoperative setting as a proof of principle.

Median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.7-10.3); corresponding PFS rates were 30.8%, 8.2%, and 6.1%. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year local (primary tumor) control rates were 78.8%, 57.7%, and 55.4%. Multivariate analysis showed that delivery of 63 Gy to the primary tumor (PZ.014), having a primary tumor volume <134 cm3 (PZ.008), and having a stable or higher KPS score after treatment (PZ.01) were independent predictors of better OS. The most common severe (grades 3-4) acute toxicities were hematologic: leukopenia (37.9%), thrombocytopenia (10.1%), and anemia (6.9%). No patients experienced grade 4 or 5 radiationrelated toxicity; 2.5% had acute grade 3 pneumonitis, and 6.6% had acute grade 3 radiation esophagitis. Conclusion(s): Thoracic 3D-RT to the primary tumor with concurrent chemotherapy led to satisfactory survival outcomes with acceptable toxicity. Radiation dose, primary tumor volume, and PFS after treatment all predicted survival in these patients with limited-metastasis NSCLC.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
2301,"Magnetic navigation in left-sided AV reentrant tachycardias: Preliminary results of a retrograde approach Introduction: A novel magnetic navigation system allows remote guidance of floppy radiofrequency (RF) ablation catheters. We evaluated the feasibility of mapping and ablation of left-sided accessory pathways (APs) using the retrograde transaortic approach with this system. This might open the gate to retrograde ablation of left atrial arrhythmias. Methods and Results: Twenty consecutive patients were included. A Helios II was used in five and in 15 a Celsius RMT RF catheter with higher magnetic mass and different flexibility was used. Mapping and ablation were attempted. The learning curve was analyzed. Ablation was acutely successful in 60% of the patients using the Helios II and in 80% using the Celsius RMT. Median procedure time was 158 minutes, with median patient and physician fluoroscopy times of 26 and 4 minutes. In the last 10 patients, procedure times became significantly shorter (median 122 minutes, only Celsius RMT catheters) and standard catheters had to be used only twice. No complications occurred. Conclusion(s): Remote retrograde transaortic RF ablation of left-sided APs is feasible, safe, and reduces the physician's fluoroscopy exposure. There is a very steep initial learning curve, with the success rate increasing from 50% in the first 10 cases to 80% in the last 10 cases. Different catheter configurations may influence the outcome. © 2007 by Futura Publishing Company, Inc.",Excluded
294,"Radiation-induced apoptosis varies among individuals and is modified by sex and age Purpose: Although there are considerable data on mechanisms of radiation-induced apoptosis in vitro and in animal models, little is known about functional variation in these pathways in humans. We sought to develop a tractable system to evaluate this. Material(s) and Method(s): Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 90 healthy volunteers, divided into two aliquots, one irradiated with a 5 Gy dose and the other sham-treated (0 Gy), and assessed for damage-induced apoptosis after 24 hours. To investigate reproducibility, 10 individuals spanning the entire radiation-induced apoptotic range were tested three times each, with 3-6 months between replicates. Result(s): We observed surprising heterogeneity in apoptosis among individuals, ranging from 21-62%. Biological replicates from a single individual, however, were completely concordant, suggesting the variability observed across individuals is not the result of stochastic or short-term effects. We found significantly higher radiation-induced apoptosis in males than in females (Mean: 41.0% vs. 30.7%; p < 3.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>). Moreover, advancing age was associated with decreasing radiation-induced apoptosis in males (p = 0.01) but not females (p = 0.82). Conclusion(s): Our results provide evidence that the function of cellular pathways crucial for stress-induced apoptosis varies by sex and could decline with age in humans.

2055,"Optimization of acquisition time for ultrafast parathyroid SPECT imaging using a solid state CZT camera Objective: To determine the optimal acquisition time for parathyroid SPECT imaging on a dedicated solid state camera (SSC). Method(s): A Discovery 570c SPECT/CT device (GE Healthcare) was used for fast imaging of parathyroid adenomas. Six females and 2 males suspected of having parathyroid adenoma were injected with 740 MBq Tc99m-MIBI and SPECT/CT was performed using a standard camera (Infinia Hawkeye 4, GE Healthcare) for an 18 minute SPECT acquisition time. An additional 5 minute SPECT acquisition was performed on the SSC with the detector orientation modified from the standard <> (for cardiac imaging) to <> to position the thyroid in the field-of-view with the highest sensitivity and resolution. No attenuation correction was applied. To optimize acquisition time, SSC list-mode data were reframed to provide equivalent acquisition times at 15 s and at every 30 s interval up to 5 minutes. For semi-quantitative assessment of image quality, lesion-to-background ratios were calculated for parathyroid adenomas diagnosed on the standard SPECT/CT study. Reconstructed ultrafast SPECT studies with various acquisition times were compared for image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Result(s): Diagnosis based on results of the two cameras concurred: 4 patients were positive for parathyroid adenoma, 2 were negative, and 2 were equivocal requiring further confirmation. The average lesion-to-background ratio measured on SSC for the 4 positive parathyroid adenomas increased from 1.3 at a 15 s acquisition time to 2.8 at 3 min and 3.1 at 5 min, compared to 1.9 for the standard SPECT. The incremental increase in average lesion-to-background ratio was <3% for each additional 30 s SSC acquisition time beyond the first 3 min. The visually assessed quality of SSC images showed only moderate incremental improvement for additional acquisition times above 3 min. Conclusion(s): Fast parathyroid SPECT acquisition with the Discovery 570c showed the same diagnostic results as the standard SPECT with similar or superior image quality. Reduction of SSC acquisition time from 5 to 3 min had only a moderate effect on image quality assessed visually and by the semi-quantitative lesion-to-background ratio. The fast acquisition times and the linearity in sensitivity of SSC at clinical count rates support the value of additional studies to determine whether in future the injected dose of the radiopharmaceutical could be significantly reduced for an optimal acquisition without adversely affecting image quality. This may potentially decrease radiation exposure to the patient, improve clinical throughput and provide a partial solution in times of Tc-99m shortage.",Excluded
3409,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included
1950,"Effect of low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy on the sexual health of men with optimal sexual function before treatment: Analysis at >=7 years of follow-up OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy on the sexual health of men with >=7 years of prospective evaluation and optimum sexual function before treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 223 patients with T1b to T3a prostate cancer and a median (range) age of 66 (50-82) years were treated with permanent seed implantation from November 1990 to March 1998. They were followed for a median (range) of 8.2 (7-14.1) years using prospective quality-of-life measures. Erectile function (EF) was assessed using a physician-assigned score and beginning in June 2000; the validated International Index of EF (IIEF-5) was used as a complementary method to quantify late EF. No adjustment was made to differentiate sexual function with or with no pharmacological intervention for EF. Pearson's chi-square test and Student's t-test were used to compare the groups. RESULT(S): Of the 223 men, 131 (59%) had optimal EF before their brachytherapy; of these, 51 (40%) at the last follow-up evaluation were using either a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (44, 86%), yohimbine (two, 4%) or alprostadil (five, 10%). The age at implantation was highly predictive of current EF; 23 of 25 (92%) men aged 50-59 years had a current EF of >=2; those aged 60-69 and 70-78 years had an EF of >=2 in 48/75 (64%) and 18/31 (58%) (P = 0.01). A current IIEF-5 score of >=16 also correlated highly with age at implant, i.e. 50-59, 16/25 (64%); 60-69, 20/75 (27%) and 70-78 years, 6/31 (19%) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION(S): Patients aged <60 years and with optimal EF before low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy have a very high probability of long-term EF. © 2007 THE AUTHORS.",Excluded
752,"Randomized trial of 90Sr/90Y beta-radiation versus placebo control for treatment of in-stent restenosis BACKGROUND: After conventional treatment of in-stent restenosis, the incidence of recurrent clinical restenosis may approach 40%. We report the first multicenter, blinded, and randomized trial of intracoronary radiation with the use of a 90Sr/90Y beta-source for the treatment of in-stent restenosis., METHODS AND RESULTS: After successful catheter-based treatment of in-stent restenosis, 476 patients were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary catheter containing either 90Sr/90Y (n=244) or placebo (n=232) sources. The prescribed dose 2 mm from the center of the source was 18.4 Gy for vessels between 2.70 and 3.35 mm in diameter and 23.0 Gy for vessels between 3.36 and 4.0 mm. The primary end point, ie, clinically driven target-vessel revascularization by 8 months, was observed in 56 (26.8%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 39 (17.0%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.015). The incidence of the composite including death, myocardial infarction, and target-vessel revascularization was observed in 60 (28.7%) of the patients assigned to placebo and 44 (19.1%) of the patients assigned to radiation (P=0.024). Binary 8-month angiographic restenosis (> or =50% diameter stenosis) within the entire segment treated with radiation was reduced from 45.2% in the placebo-treated patients to 28.8% in the 90Sr/90Y-treated patients (P=0.001). Stent thromboses occurred in 1 patient assigned to placebo <24 hours after the procedure and in 1 patient assigned to 90Sr/90Y at day 244., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that beta-radiation using 90Sr/90Y is both safe and effective for preventing recurrence in patients with in-stent restenosis.",Included
1308,"High dose rate brachytherapy in the management of lung transplant airway stenosis BACKGROUND: Airway complications after lung transplantation remain a major cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Interventional bronchoscopic management continues to be the main modality in the management of these problems., METHODS: Four patients with airway stenoses after lung transplantation received high dose rate brachytherapy for management of recurrent stenosis. All 4 patients had been treated with various bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation and stenting, electrocautery ablation, and neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser therapy. High dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy was subsequently used in all 4 patients for management of recurrent airway obstruction. The radiation dose for all 4 patients was 3 Gy at a distance of 1 cm from the center of the catheter., RESULTS: All four patients have had routine follow-up after endobronchial brachytherapy treatments. Of the 4 patients, 2 treated with this modality showed a significant response to therapy in that the bronchus remained free of obstruction after treatment; 1 patient had partial improvement, and 1 patient failed to show significant improvement and expired from the sequelae of persistent airway obstruction., CONCLUSIONS: Endobronchial brachytherapy can be an effective modality for managing recurrent stenoses caused by hyperplastic granulation tissue at the bronchial anastomosis. The optimal timing and ideal candidate for intraluminal radiation therapy for this problem remains a challenge and warrants further investigation.",Excluded
444,"A comparison of thoracic CT and abdominal CT for the identification of thoracic blunt trauma BACKGROUND: In light of current trends to limit radiation exposure and costs, as well as increased traffic safety, computed tomography (CT) may have decreasing value for evaluating patients with blunt trauma. The authors examined the utility of chest x-ray and abdominal CT for identifying clinically significant thoracic blunt trauma., METHODS: In this prospective study, findings on thoracic CT, abdominal CT, and chest x-ray from trauma patients were compared to assess injury prevalence and relevance to treatment outcomes., RESULTS: Four hundred forty-four patients were identified, of whom 76% had no findings. Occult findings had significantly lower Injury Severity Scores. All clinically relevant pneumothoraces and most other injuries could be identified without thoracic CT. Two of 3 aortic abnormalities were suspected from chest x-ray., CONCLUSIONS: Clinically significant injuries can be identified with abdominal CT and chest x-ray, safely allowing reductions in radiation exposure, hospital stays, and costs by limiting the use of thoracic CT.

1215,"Brachytherapy in lip carcinoma: Long-term results Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose-rate brachytherapy for local control and relapse-free survival in squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas of the lips. We compared two groups: one with tumors on the skin and the other with tumors on the lip. Patients and Methods: All patients had been treated at Claudius Regaud Cancer Centre from 1990 to 2008 for squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma. Low-dose-rate brachytherapy was performed with iridium 192 wires according to the Paris system rules. On average, the dose delivered was 65 Gy. Result(s): 172 consecutive patients were included in our study; 69 had skin carcinoma (squamous cell or basal cell), and 92 had squamous cell mucosal carcinoma. The average follow-up time was 5.4 years. In the skin cancer group, there were five local recurrences and one lymph node recurrence. In the mucosal cancer group, there were ten local recurrences and five lymph node recurrences. The 8-year relapse-free survival for the entire population was 80%. The 8-year relapse-free survival was 85% for skin carcinoma 75% for mucosal carcinoma, with no significant difference between groups. The functional results were satisfactory for 99% of patients, and the cosmetic results were satisfactory for 92%. Maximal toxicity observed was Grade 2. Conclusion(s): Low-dose-rate brachytherapy can be used to treat lip carcinomas at Stages T1 and T2 as the only treatment with excellent results for local control and relapse-free survival. The benefits of brachytherapy are also cosmetic and functional, with 91% of patients having no side effects. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
93,"Cervical lymphatic metastases from occult primary tumor. A nation-wide 20-year study from the Danish society of head and neck oncology INTRODUCTION: The management of patients with cervical lymph node metastases from unknown primary tumours is a major challenge in oncology. This study presents data collected from all five oncology centres in Denmark. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 352 consecutive patients with squamous cell or undifferentiated tumours seen from 1975 to 1995, a total of 277 (79%) were treated with radical intent. Most patients received radiotherapy to both sides of the neck as well as elective irradiation of the mucosal sites in nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx (81%). Irradiation of the ipsilateral neck only was done in 26 patients (10%). Radical surgery was the only treatment in 23 N1-N2 patients (9%). RESULT(S): The five-year estimates of neck control, disease-specific survival and overall survival for radically treated patients were 51%, 48% and 36%, respectively. The emergence of the occult primary was observed in 66 patients (19%). About half of the emerging primaries were within the head and neck region with oropharynx, hypopharynx and oral cavity being the most common sites. Emerging primaries outside the head and neck region were primarily located in the lung (19 patients) and oesophagus (five patients). The most important factor for neck control was nodal stage (5-year estimates 69% [N1], 58% [N2] and 30% [N3]). Other important parameters for neck control and disease-specific survival included haemoglobin, gender and overall treatment time. Patients treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy had a relative risk of recurrence in the head and neck region of 1.9 compared to patients treated at both neck and mucosa. At five years, the estimated control rates were 27% (ipsilateral) and 51% (bilateral; p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-specific survival estimates were 28% and 45%, respectively (p = 0.10). DISCUSSION: Extensive irradiation to both sides of the neck and the mucosa in the entire pharyngeal axis and larynx resulted in significantly fewer loco-regional failures compared to patients treated with ipsilateral techniques, but only a trend towards better survival. Determination of the optimal strategy in terms of loco-regional control, survival and morbidity requires a prospective randomized trial.",Excluded
2091,"Association of clinical response and long-term outcome among patients with biopsied orbital pseudotumor receiving modern radiation therapy Purpose: To retrospectively evaluate institutional outcomes for patients treated with modern radiation therapy (RT) for biopsied orbital pseudotumor (OP). Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (26 affected orbits) with OP were treated with RT between January 2002 and December 2011. All patients underwent biopsy with histopathologic exclusion of other disease processes. Sixteen patients (80%) were treated with intensity modulated RT, 3 (15%) with opposed lateral beams, and 1 (5%) with electrons. Median RT dose was 27 Gy (range 25.2-30.6 Gy). Response to RT was evaluated at 4 months post-RT. Partial response (PR) was defined as improvement in orbital symptoms without an increase in steroid dose. Complete response (CR) 1 and CR 2 were defined as complete resolution of orbital symptoms with reduction in steroid dose (CR 1) or complete tapering of steroids (CR 2). The median follow-up period was 18.6 months (range 4-81.6 months). Result(s): Seventeen patients (85%) demonstrated response to RT, with 7 (35%), 1 (5%), and 9 (45%) achieving a PR, CR 1, and CR 2, respectively. Of the 17 patients who had >=PR at 4 months post-RT, 6 (35%) experienced recurrence of symptoms. Age (>46 years vs <=46 years, P=.04) and clinical response to RT (CR 2 vs CR 1/PR, P=.05) were significantly associated with pseudotumor recurrence. Long-term complications were seen in 7 patients (35%), including 4 with cataract formation, 1 with chronic dry eye, 1 with enophthalmos, and 1 with keratopathy. Conclusion(s): RT is an effective treatment for improving symptoms and tapering steroids in patients with a biopsy supported diagnosis of OP. Older age and complete response to RT were associated with a significantly reduced probability of symptom recurrence. The observed late complications may be related to RT, chronic use of steroids/immunosuppressants, medical comorbidities, or combination of factors. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
1650,"Increased protoporphyrin IX accumulation does not improve the effect of photodynamic therapy for actinic keratosis: a randomized controlled trial Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with methyl aminolaevulinate (MAL) is highly effective for treating actinic keratosis (AK) on the face/scalp, but less effective on the extremities. Insufficient accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) may cause these inferior efficacy rates. However, it is possible to increase PpIX accumulation by extending the MAL application time and/or pretreating the skin with curettage. Objective(s): To investigate whether increased PpIX accumulation improves the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs in a randomized intra-individual study. Method(s): Twenty-two patients with 533 AKs on both hands were treated with MAL-PDT. To obtain different concentrations of PpIX, four symmetrical areas on each patient were randomly allocated to different regimens: (i) 3-h MAL application without prior curettage (3hC-); (ii) 3 h with curettage (3hC+); (iii) 21 h without curettage (21hC-); and (iv) 21 h with curettage (21hC+). Treatment efficacy was evaluated after 3 months, whereas PpIX fluorescence, pain and erythema were assessed during and after PDT. Result(s): Extended MAL application with and without curettage increased PpIX accumulation significantly compared with the standard 3hC+ regimen (P = 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). However, the median total clearance rates did not improve accordingly: 3hC+ (55.0%), 21hC- (55.0%) and 21hC+ (53.6%). Conversely, insufficient PpIX accumulation in the 3hC- regimen led to a significantly lower clearance rate (33.3%) than the other regimens (P < 0.045). Furthermore, pain and erythema were correlated to PpIX accumulation. Conclusion(s): Increased PpIX accumulation does not improve the effect of MAL-PDT for AKs on the hands, but leads to worse adverse events. Different strategies are needed to improve PDT on the extremities.Copyright © 2016 British Association of Dermatologists",Excluded
1539,"Predictors of Radiotherapy Induced Bone Injury (RIBI) after stereotactic lung radiotherapy Background: The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and dosimetric factors associated with radiotherapy induced bone injury (RIBI) following stereotactic lung radiotherapy. Method(s): Inoperable patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer, treated with SBRT, who received 54 or 60 Gy in 3 fractions, and had a minimum of 6 months follow up were reviewed. Archived treatment plans were retrieved, ribs delineated individually and treatment plans re-computed using heterogeneity correction. Clinical and dosimetric factors were evaluated for their association with rib fracture using logistic regression analysis; a dose-event curve and nomogram were created. Result(s): 46 consecutive patients treated between Oct 2004 and Dec 2008 with median follow-up 25 months (m) (range 6 - 51 m) were eligible. 41 fractured ribs were detected in 17 patients; median time to fracture was 21 m (range 7 - 40 m). The mean maximum point dose in non-fractured ribs (n = 1054) was 10.5 Gy +/- 10.2 Gy, this was higher in fractured ribs (n = 41) 48.5 Gy +/- 24.3 Gy (p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, age, dose to 0.5 cc of the ribs (D0.5), and the volume of the rib receiving at least 25 Gy (V25), were significantly associated with RIBI. As D0.5 and V25 were cross-correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.57, p < 0.001), we selected D0.5 as a representative dose parameter. On multivariate analysis, age (odds ratio: 1.121, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.21, p = 0.003), female gender (odds ratio: 4.43, 95% CI: 1.68 - 11.68, p = 0.003), and rib D0.5 (odds ratio: 1.0009, 95% CI: 1.0007 - 1.001, p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with rib fracture.Using D0.5, a dose-event curve was constructed estimating risk of fracture from dose at the median follow up of 25 months after treatment. In our cohort, a 50% risk of rib fracture was associated with a D0.5 of 60 Gy. Conclusion(s): Dosimetric and clinical factors contribute to risk of RIBI and both should be included when modeling risk of toxicity. A nomogram is presented using D0.5, age, and female gender to estimate risk of RIBI following SBRT. This requires validation. © 2012 Taremi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
2811,"Correlation of factors affecting correction of meniscal extrusion and outcome after medial meniscus root repair Introduction: Meniscus extrusion in medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRT) is a consistent MRI finding and correction of extrusion is a primary objective of the meniscal root repair. The purpose of the study is to evaluate feasibility of correction of extrusion and correlation of various factors affecting the postoperative extrusion correction and outcomes in all degenerative medial meniscus posterior roots (MMPRTs). Method(s): A retrospective study of patients who presented with degenerative MMPRTs following trivial incident (Jun 2014 and Aug 2018) and included isolated Laprade type 2 root tear with extrusion in MRI. Patients with ligament injuries, tricompartmental arthritis, malalignment (> 50) and irreparable meniscal tears excluded. All patients underwent arthroscopic trans-tibial tunnel suture pull-out repair. A screening MRI was taken at a 6-month follow-up and functional scores (IKDC and Lysholm's) at final follow-up. The effects of age, gender, duration of symptoms, hip-knee-ankle angle on weight-bearing X-rays, ICRS grading of cartilage status, and MRI data (extrusion distance, tunnel location and healing status of meniscus) on outcomes were analysed. Result(s): MMPRT (n = 54) with a mean follow-up of 34.6 months (24-48). Mean functional outcomes improved postoperatively IKDC (43.40 +/- 5.16-78.65 +/- 5.11, p < 0.001) and Lysholm's (65.27 +/- 4.28-83.16 +/- 4.83, p < 0.001) scores at final follow-up. 57.4% (31) had good correction of extrusion, 3.7% (2) no correction and 38.8% (21) showed increase in extrusion postoperatively. Of all the factors we explored, age, ICRS (low grade) and knee varus (less 2.5 degree) affected extrusion correction. Patients with healed (41 patients), partially healed (9 patients) and anatomic tunnel placement (46 patients) had better extrusion correction than those with non-healing (4 patients) and non-anatomical tunnel (8 patients). Conclusion(s): Patients younger than 50 years, with low grade cartilage damage (ICRS 1, 2), lower KL grade and varus alignment (< 2.50) had good correction of extrusion. Correction of extrusion/progression of extrusion did not influence the clinical outcome at the short-term. The progression of meniscal extrusion is inevitable even after successful repair in elderly and high-risk patients.
