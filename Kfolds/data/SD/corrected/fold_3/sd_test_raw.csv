4221,"Neoadjuvant radiotherapy combined with capecitabine and sorafenib in patients with advanced KRAS-mutated rectal cancer: A phase I/II trial (SAKK 41/08) Background KRAS mutation occurs in ~40% of locally advanced rectal cancers (LARCs). The multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has radiosensitising effects and might improve outcomes for standard preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC. Methods Adult patients with KRAS-mutated T3/4 and/or N1/2M0 LARC were included in this phase I/II study. The phase I dose-escalation study of capecitabine plus sorafenib and radiotherapy was followed by a phase II study assessing efficacy and safety. Primary end-points were to: establish the maximum tolerated dose of the regimen in phase I; determine the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in phase II defined as Dworak regression grade 3 and 4. Results Fifty-four patients were treated at 18 centres in Switzerland and Hungary; 40 patients were included in the single-arm phase II study. Recommended doses from phase I comprised radiotherapy (45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) with capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily x 33 plus sorafenib 400 mg/d. Median daily dose intensity in phase II was radiotherapy 100%, capecitabine 98.6%, and sorafenib 100%. The pCR rate (Dworak 3/4) was 60% (95% CI, 43.3-75.1%) by central independent pathologic review. Sphincter preservation was achieved in 89.5%, R0 resection in 94.7%, and downstaging in 81.6%. The most common grade 3 toxicities during phase II included diarrhoea (15.0%), skin toxicity outside radiotherapy field (12.5%), pain (7.5%), skin toxicity in radiotherapy field, proctitis, fatigue and cardiac ischaemia (each 5%). Conclusions Combining sorafenib and standard chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine is highly active in patients with KRAS-mutated LARC with acceptable toxicity and deserves further investigation. www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00869570.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
3546,"Memory CD4 T-cell subsets discriminated by CD43 expression level in A-bomb survivors PURPOSE: Our previous study showed that radiation exposure reduced the diversity of repertoires of memory thymus-derived cells (T cells) with cluster of differentiation (CD)- 4 among atomic-bomb (A-bomb) survivors. To evaluate the maintenance of T-cell memory within A-bomb survivors 60 years after radiation exposure, we examined functionally distinct memory CD4 T-cell subsets in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of the survivors., METHODS: Three functionally different subsets of memory CD4 T cells were identified by differential CD43 expression levels and measured using flow cytometry. These subsets consist of functionally mature memory cells, cells weakly responsive to antigenic stimulation, and those cells functionally anergic and prone to spontaneous apoptosis., RESULTS: The percentages of these subsets within the peripheral blood CD4 T-cell pool all significantly increased with age. Percentages of functionally weak and anergic subsets were also found to increase with radiation dose, fitting to a log linear model. Within the memory CD4 T-cell pool, however, there was an inverse association between radiation dose and the percentage of functionally mature memory cells., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the steady state of T cell memory, which is regulated by cell activation and/or cell survival processes in subsets, may have been perturbed by prior radiation exposure among A-bomb survivors.",Included
4422,"Significance of surgical resection for the treatment of multiple brain metastases Background: We investigated the role of surgery in the treatment of multiple brain metastases when performed with radiation therapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and thirty-eight patients who underwent resection for brain metastases and received 30 Gy or more of adjuvant radiation therapy were entered into this study. Seventy-seven of the 138 patients (56%) had single brain metastases (Single Group), while the remaining 61 patients (44%) had multiple foci (Multiple Group). The 138 patients were divided into four subgroups; patients in Single Group treated with total or subtotal resection (Group A), those in Multiple Group who underwent total or subtotal resection and had remaining tumors smaller than 2 cm (Group B), those in Single Group treated with partial resection (Group C), and the other patients in Multiple Group (Group D). Result(s): The median survival was 8.7 and 9.2 months for the Single Group and the Multiple Group, respectively (not statistically different). The median survival was 9.6, 12.4, 3.7, and 4.5 months for Groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. Survival duration differed significantly between GroupsA/B and Groups C/D (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): Surgical reduction of tumor volume which is approximately larger than 2 cm improves the efficacy of adjuvant radiation therapy and contributes to survival even in the patients with multiple, brain metastases.",Excluded
3785,"Efficacy of RADPAD R protection drape in reducing radiation exposure to the primary operator during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) BACKGROUND: The efficacy of RADPAD R (a sterile, lead-free drape) has been demonstrated to reduce the scatter radiation to the primary operator during fluoroscopic procedures. However, the use of the RADPAD R during TAVI procedures has not been studied. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is now an established treatment for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis who are deemed inoperable or at high risk for conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR). Consequently the radiation exposure to the patient and the interventional team from this procedure has become a matter of interest and importance. Methods to reduce radiation exposure to the interventional team during this procedure should be actively investigated. In this single center prospective study, we determined the radiation dose during this procedure and the efficacy of RADPAD R in reducing the radiation dose to the primary operator., METHODS: Fifty consecutive patients due to undergo elective TAVI procedures were identified. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo the procedure with or without the use of a RADPAD R drape. There were 25 patients in each group and dosimetry was performed at the left eye level of the primary operator. The dosimeter was commenced at the start of the procedure, and the dose was recorded immediately after the end of the procedure. Fluoroscopy times and DAP were also recorded prospectively., RESULTS: Twenty-five patients underwent transfemoral TAVI using a RADPAD R and 25 with no-RADPAD R. The mean primary operator radiation dose was significantly lower in the RADPAD group at 14.8 mSv vs. 24.3 mSv in the no-RADPAD group (P=0.008). There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy times or dose-area products between the two patient groups. The dose to the primary operator relative to fluoroscopy time (RADPAD: slope=0.325; no RADPAD: slope=1.148; analysis of covariance F=7.47, P=0.009) and dose area product (RADPAD: slope=0.0007; no RADPAD: slope=0.002; analysis of covariance F=7.38; P=0.009) was smaller in the RADPAD group compared to no-RADPAD group., CONCLUSIONS: Use of a RADPAD R significantly reduces radiation exposure to the primary operator during TAVI procedures.",Excluded
4449,"Change of cathepsin K activity in human skin in vivo after chronic ultraviolet damage Objective: Photoaging is histologically characterized by the accumulation of abnormal elastin-containing material and disorganization of decreased bundles of collagen fibers. The fundamental mechanisms are still poorly understood. So far, most of the photoaging studies are focused on matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It was described that cathepsin K (catK) might play an important role in mediating intracellular elastin degradation.We hypothesize that catK may be related to ECM homeostasis in photoaging. We therefore studied the activity of catK in human skin in response to chronic SSR. Method(s): Eight healthy Chinese volunteers (4 males and 4 females) were enrolled in the study after signing an informed consent that was approved by the medical ethics committee in our hospital ([2009]2-2). They were 21 to 26 years old with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes III or IV. The untanned upper buttock region was used as the site for exposure. The random side of upper buttock region was exposed to 1 MED of SSR (spectrum of 290-400 nm, 30% UVA + 70% UVB) per exposure every day for 5 successive days/week for 6 weeks. The other side of the upper buttock received no irradiation as control.The specific cathepsin K substrate, z-Leu-Arg-7-amido-4-methyl coumarin, was used. The fluorescence which the cleavage product emitted was recorded at 360 nm. The activity of catK was determined by the intensity of the fluorescence. All measurements were done in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined by using the paired samples t test. Calculations were performed using SPSS 17.0. Statistical significance was set at P<.05. Result(s): Chronic SSR exposure for 6 weeks induced a significant clinical and histologic change of chronic photodamage. The result showed that the average activity of the SSR-induced group was (8.09 +/- 5.22) 3 10-3 (nmol/mg * min) while that of the control group was (117.54 +/-39.01) x10-3 (nmol/mg * min). These data suggest that catK activity of the SSR-induced skin was obviously decreased compared to the normal control skin (P<.001). Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that catK is related to photoaging, probably the process of solar elastosis.We propose that the decrease of catK activity might lead to a decline of elastin degradation and subsequent accumulation of elastin in the extracellular space.",Excluded
4376,"A mouse radiation-induced liver disease model for stereotactic body radiation therapy validated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma PURPOSE: Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses that result in radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) as well as to determine dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice; these parameters are still undefined in HCC SBRT., METHODS: This study consisted of two phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy-based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. The pathological differences, signs [such as mouse performance status (MPS)], and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of the OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in humans, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiotherapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in a mouse study., RESULTS: The evaluation criteria of the mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs were as follows: MPS >= 2.0 +/- 0.52, AST/ALT >= 589.2 +/- 118.5/137.4 +/- 15.3 U/L, serum albumin <= 16.8 +/- 2.29 g/L. The preliminary dose constraints of the OARs were also obtained, such as those for the liver (average dose <= 26.36 +/- 1.71 Gy) and gastrointestinal tract (maximum dose <= 22.63 Gy). Mouse RILD models were able to be developed when the livers were irradiated with average doses of >=31.76 +/- 1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice have also been validated in HCC patients., CONCLUSIONS: Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for the OARs and evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiotherapy-related signs, and the authors' results favor the study of further approaches to treat HCC with SBRT.",Included
4135,"Efficacy of three-dimensional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (3D CE-MRA) in the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome Objective: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of various upper extremity positions (adduction-abduction) on vascular structures in contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MR angiographic studies performed in patients with thoracic outlet syndrome. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-two consecutive patients with clinical symptoms of neurovascular thoracic outlet syndrome were examined by 1.0 T MR unit. Examinations were studied by three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography with the arms positioned in abduction and adduction in the same patients. Result(s): In twenty-one of 44 subclavian arteries, impingement or stenosis with different degrees were found. Majority of lesions were localized in the costoclavicular region. Venous phase sequences of contrast-enhanced MR angiography showed compression of the subclavian vein in the 17 areas. Conclusion(s): Thoracic outlet syndrome remains controversial in both diagnosis and treatment, particulary in patients with no muscle atrophy, hand ischemia findings or venous stasis symptoms. Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced MR angiography is noninvasive and requires neither ionizing radiation nor administration of iodinated contrast material- and may be used to diagnose early compression findings and stenosis of the subclavian vessels. © Trakya University Faculty of Medicine.",Excluded
4028,"Comparing different analysis methods for quantifying the MRI amide proton transfer (APT) effect in hyperacute stroke patients Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is a pH mapping method based on the chemical exchange saturation transfer phenomenon that has potential for penumbra identification following stroke. The majority of the literature thus far has focused on generating pH-weighted contrast using magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry analysis instead of quantitative pH mapping. In this study, the widely used asymmetry analysis and a model-based analysis were both assessed on APT data collected from healthy subjects (n = 2) and hyperacute stroke patients (n = 6, median imaging time after onset = 2 hours 59 minutes). It was found that the model-based approach was able to quantify the APT effect with the lowest variation in grey and white matter (<= 13.8 %) and the smallest average contrast between these two tissue types (3.48 %) in the healthy volunteers. The model-based approach also performed quantitatively better than the other measures in the hyperacute stroke patient APT data, where the quantified APT effect in the infarct core was consistently lower than in the contralateral normal appearing tissue for all the patients recruited, with the group average of the quantified APT effect being 1.5 +/- 0.3 % (infarct core) and 1.9 +/- 0.4 % (contralateral). Based on the fitted parameters from the model-based analysis and a previously published pH and amide proton exchange rate relationship, quantitative pH maps for hyperacute stroke patients were generated, for the first time, using APT imaging.

4404,"Feasibility and Safety of Ultrasonography Guidance and Flank Position during Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Purpose: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is generally performed using fluoroscopy, which is associated with exposure to radiation. Another drawback of fluoroscopic guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the prone position, which is not suitable for all patients. In this study we evaluated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 603 patients with a mean +/- SD age of 50.9 +/- 13 years were included in this study from December 2010 to July 2016. Access to the collecting system and tract dilation were performed under ultrasound guidance. Perioperative data on the stone-free rate, operative time, length of stay and complication rates were recorded. Result(s): Successful access was achieved in all but 1 patient. Mean operative time was 56.6 +/- 6.5 minutes. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 529 patients (87.7%) and Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications were noted in 17 (2.8%). Blood transfusion was necessary in 43 patients (7.1%). However, bleeding was self-limited in all cases and did not require angioembolization. Conclusion(s): To our knowledge this is the largest series of ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy with the patient in the flank position. Unlike in other studies we used this procedure in all patients irrespective of stone burden, renal anomaly and body habitus. Ultrasound guided percutaneous nephrolithotomy has outcomes comparable to those of conventional percutaneous nephrolithotomy and it is not associated with radiation exposure. Furthermore, anesthesia while in the flank position might be less harmful in some patients, including those with obesity or cardiopulmonary comorbidities.Copyright © 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.",Excluded
3776,"Radiation exposure among patients with the highest CT scan utilization in the emergency department The risk of cancer from computed tomography (CT) scan radiation is a rising concern in the medical field. Our objectives were to determine how many patients received more than ten CT scans in an academic emergency department (ED) over the course of 7 years and to quantify their radiation exposure and lifetime attributable risk of cancer. An electronic chart review was performed at our urban academic institution with an annual census of 110,000 patients. All patients who underwent a CT scan performed during ED management between the dates of January 2001 and December 2007 were identified. Specific predetermined data elements (e.g., subject demographics, type of CT scan) were extracted by two researchers blinded to hypothesis, using a preformatted data form. After identifying patients with more than ten CTs performed during the study period, radiation exposure was calculated based on accepted and reported radiation doses for the respective anatomic CTs, and lifetime attributable cancer risk was calculated based on the seventh report of the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR VII) projections. Over the 7-year study period, 24,393 patients received 34,671 CT scans. The vast majority of patients (17,909) received a single CT. Twenty-six (0.1 %) patients received more than ten CTs totaling 374 scans with an average radiation exposure of 83.4 mSv. The maximum lifetime attributable risk for any individual in this cohort was 1.7 % above the baseline cancer risk. Among those undergoing CT imaging in our ED, high-exposure patients (greater than ten scans) constituted a significant minority, while more than one in four patients underwent more than one CT scan during the study period. While the presumed overall risk of radiation-induced cancer continues to be low, it is important for the emergency physician to use clinical knowledge as well as concern for the patient when utilizing radiographic imaging. Increasing attributable cancer risk may have important public health implications in the future, regardless of the low individual risk.",Excluded

Method(s): We inspected the results of 106 patients with the diagnoses of idiopathic neuralgia that treated with percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy retrospectively. The scores of visual analog scale(VAS) were noted preoperative and postoperative periods at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months and were used for statistical analysis. Result(s): Mean age of 106 patients was 67.31+/-8.85 years. Duration of symptoms was 19.1+/-13.1 months. Duration of symptoms did not change significantly according to gender (p=0.755), or site of trigeminal pain (p=0.158). There was not any statistical significance between gender, effected branch of trigemial nerve and side of the pain. Preoperative mean VAS score was 9.6+/-0.75. Postoperative mean VAS score values were 3.25+/-2.44 at first month, 3.23+/-2.43 at third months, 3.12+/-2.78 at sixth months and 2.59+/-3.18 at postoperative twelfth months. We found statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months VAS scores (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): Percutaneous radiofrequency trigeminal rhizotomy is the minimally invasive treatment modality with lower complication rates and it has a high rate of efficacy when compared with invasive methods. It is most cost-effective procedure to choose if the pain recurs.Copyright © 2018, AVES Ibrahim KARA. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3838,"Selective brain responses to acute and chronic low-dose X-ray irradiation in males and females Radiation exposure is known to have profound effects on the brain, leading to precursor cell dysfunction and debilitating cognitive declines [Nat. Med. 8 (2002) 955]. Although a plethora of data exist on the effects of high radiation doses, the effects of low-dose irradiation, such as ones received during repetitive diagnostic and therapeutic exposures, are still under-investigated [Am. J. Otolaryngol. 23 (2002) 215; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 97 (2000) 889; Curr. Opin. Neurol. 16 (2003) 129]. Furthermore, most studies of the biological effects of ionizing radiation have been performed using a single acute dose, while clinically and environmentally relevant exposures occur predominantly under chronic/repetitive conditions. Here, we have used a mouse model to compare the effects of chronic/repetitive and acute low-dose radiation (LDR) exposure (0.5Gy) to ionizing radiation on the brain in vivo. We examined the LDR effects on p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/ERK2), CaMKII, and AKT signaling-the interconnected pathways that have been previously shown to be crucial for neuronal survival upon irradiation. We report perturbations in ERK1/2, AKT, and CREB upon acute and chronic/repetitive low-dose exposure in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice. These studies were paralleled by the analysis of radiation effects on neurogenesis and cellular proliferation. Repetitive exposure had a much more pronounced effect on cellular signaling and neurogenesis than acute exposure. These results suggest that studies of single acute exposures might be limited in terms of their predictive value. We also present the first evidence of sex differences in radiation-induced signaling in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. We show the role of estrogens in brain radiation responses and discuss the implications of the observed changes.",Included

Aim - Evaluate two RT schedules and two different CT durations by a retrospective comparison of the CRT regimens used by two centres between 1 994 and 2000. Methods - In centre I (regimen I), patients received 2 CT concomitantly to a continuous RT (50 Gy/25 fractions/5 weeks). In centre II (regimen II), patients received 6 CT, 3 were concomitant to a split course RT (20 Gy/10 fractions x 3 courses) and 3 CT were delivered after CRT. Results - A total of 129 patients were included, 74 in centre I and 55 in centre II respectively. Main patient characteristics were similar between the two groups. Clinical complete response to CRT was significantly more frequent in regimen I (83.8% vs 65.4%; P = 0.02). The median overall survival (OS) was 20 months in regimen I and 22 months in regimen II (NS). During follow-up, responder patients to CRT in regimen II experienced significant fewer metastasis (51.6% vs 27.8%; P = 0.03) with a trend to an increased 5-year survival (19.4% vs 11.3%) and OS (26.5 vs 21.0 months) (NS). Grade 3-4 toxicities were not different. Conclusion - Clinical complete response to CRT was significantly more frequent with a continuous RT whereas additional CT after CRT significantly reduced metastasis occurrence. CRT regimen in esophageal carcinoma may be more effective using a continuous RT schedule and additional CT courses after CRT completion. © Masson, 2006.",Excluded
3624,"Therapeutic effect of linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy with a micro-multileaf collimator for the treatment of patients with brain metastases from lung cancer Objective: To assess the efficacy of hypofractionated linac-based stereotactic radiotherapy with a micro-multileaf collimator (mMLC) in lung cancer patients with brain metastases. Method(s): Seventy-eight lesions of brain metastases in 49 lung cancer patients treated by stereotactic radiotherapy between September 2003 and December 2006 were analyzed. In the treatment planning, the planning target volume (PTV) was defined as an enhanced lesion plus 3 mm margin. A total dose of 39-42 Gy in three fractions was delivered to the isocenters of the PTV. Result(s): The median survival time after stereotactic radiotherapy was 17.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 61% and 32%, respectively. The presence of extracranial tumors, the pre-treatment performance status, and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class were significant prognostic factors. The 1-and 2-year local recurrence rates were 14% and 17%, respectively, with no serious acute toxic effect. Injuries involving brain necrosis were observed in six patients. New brain metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis was seen in more than half of the patients following treatment with stereotactic radiotherapy.

BALB/c mice are susceptible to gamma-ray induction of lymphomas. The CcS-13 strain is one of 20 CcS/Dcm (CcS) series of recombinant congenic strains, and the CcS-13 mice are resistant to gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas [1, 8]. Our preliminary tests show 50% (6/12) frequency of allelic loss at the D5Mit143 locus in thymic lymphomas induced by gamma-irradiation of the mice from (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x BALB/c backcross. Yet, in gamma-radiation-induced lymphomas from the backcross made in opposite direction, namely, (BALB/c x CcS-13)F1 x CcS-13, the analysis with the DSMit143 marker revealed low incidence of the loss of heterozygosity, 6.7% (15).

4117,"Does hyperbaric oxygen administration before or after irradiation decrease side effects of irradiation on implant sites? One of the main limitations of implant-based breast reconstruction is the high rate of complications such as capsular contracture and poor aesthetic outcome, due to adjuvant radiotherapy. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) has been used to assist wound healing in the prevention and treatment of the side effects of irradiation. We aimed to investigate this effect of HBOT on the capsule reaction and skin, applied before and after irradiation, following the placement of an implant under the dorsal skin of the rat. Fifteen Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups. A 18-mL smooth testicular implant was introduced into a subcutaneous pocket located on the dorsum of each rat. A single dose of 17-Gy irradiation was given to the implanted area of each rat at the third week. HBOT which lasted 3 weeks was administered to group I before irradiation, group II after irradiation. The control group did not receive HBOT. All of the rats were killed at the ninth week (6 weeks after irradiation). The dorsal skin with the capsule overlying the implant were excised for histopathological processing. The thickness of the capsule reaction of each group was evaluated statistically. Our histopathological examination revealed changes due to radiation in the control group. Many of these findings were found to be more subtle in group I and nearly absent in the group II. There was not any statistical difference between the thickness of the capsule reactions of the control group and group I, or group I and group II, but the capsular thickness of the control group was statistically higher than group II. It can be predicted that the use of HBOT following irradiation is an effective tool to reduce the capsule reaction of the implanted area and the tissue damage seen in radiodermatitis.",Excluded

Method(s): This phase III trial comprises two cohorts of patients deemed fit to receive cisplatin (100 mg/m2 Q3W) (cohort 1) or unfit to cisplatin (cohort 2). The SOC was Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) with cisplatin in cohort 1 (arm A) and with weekly cetuximab in cohort 2 (arm D). In both cohorts, experimental arms (arms B and C) were IMRT with cetuximab and avelumab (10 mg/kg day 7 and every 2 weeks) followed by avelumab every two weeks for 12 months. A safety phase was planned among the first 41 patients in experimental arms by monitoring grade >=IV adverse events (AEs) with an unacceptable rate of 35%. Result(s): Between September 2017 and August 2018, 82 patients with LA-SCCHN were randomised including 41 patients in experimental arms. All patients of experimental arms except one (arm C) received entire radiotherapy as planned. Most common grade >=III AEs were mucositis, radio-dermatitis, and dysphagia. Grade >=IV AEs occurred in 5/41 (12%) patients, all in arm C (no grade V). This rate was acceptable according to the hypotheses of the safety phase. In the SOC arms, grade >=IV AEs occurred in 3/21 patients (14%) in arm A and 2/20 (10%) in arm D. One grade V haemorrhage occurred in arm A.

3466,"Low-dose ultraviolet exposure early in development can lead to widespread melanoma in the opossum model Suckling young of opossums (Monodelphis domestica) were exposed to ultraviolet radiation (UVR, predominantly UVB: 290-320 nm) in part to determine an optimal protocol for induction and progression of melanoma in this species. In all, 620 litters were introduced to one of seven protocols. The lowest dose (175 J/m2) administered three times a week for almost three weeks led to the highest incidence of melanotic lesions with melanoma potential (8.1%) among young (5-month-old) adults. Among 101 much older animals (> 17 months at necropsy), 43% showed metastatic melanoma to the lymph nodes and almost one-third of these had progressed to widespread dissemination. Three of the latter animals, from a total of 13 obtained so far, were selected for detailed histological examination of disseminated disease. At necropsy, all three showed widespread metastases beyond the lymph nodes to the spleen, lungs, and other distant sites. Histological changes typical of malignant melanoma included junctional activity, mitotic figures, and nerve and vessel invasion. This novel finding leads us to conclude that UVR can act as a complete carcinogen for progression to widely disseminated disease and that exposure of sucklings can lead, in old age, to widespread metastatic melanoma in this model. The results are thus not inconsistent with the view that, in humans, early exposure to sunlight might act as an initiating factor in a later progression to malignant melanoma.",Excluded

Result(s): 77 cases were followed up for 6-132 months with an average of 50.5 months. Achilles tendon subcutaneous lengthening was performed in 2 cases, posterior tibial tendon and Achilles tendon simultaneous released for 31cases, subtalar joint arthrodesis 25 cases, calcaneus osteotomy 5 cases, triple osteotomy 28 cases, ankle arthrodesis 19 cases, internal rotation osteotomy of tibia was performed in 1 case and 1 case in external rotation osteotomy. There were 67 cases using Ilizarov fixators and 10 cases using Hybrid fixators for immobilization and correction. Stable feet were obtained and ulcers healed simultaneously when all deformities of foot and ankle had been corrected. The healing time of ulcer was average 26.5 days ranging 7-36 days, and there was no infection or delayed healing occurred in any case. Ankle ankylosis in 25 cases, 3 cases of pin tract infection, 2 wires were broken. The AOFAS score significantly increased from 70.5 +/- 4.5 preoperative to 81.6 +/- 3.9 postoperative; based special table evaluating, Excellent 28 cases, Good 42 cases, Fair7 cases. Conclusion(s): The patients with foot & ankle deformity and ulceration suffered from spinal bifida can be treated by improved Ilizarov method in one stage, and the results are satisfactory with short treatment period and decreased complications. Translational potential of this article: The characteristics of foot and ankle deformity with ulceration inpatients with spina bifida have been analyzed and the experiences on management with improved Ilizarovmethod in one stage have been summarized in this study, which updated treatment concept of neurogenic deformity with ulceration on foot and ankle joint.Copyright © 2021 The Authors",Excluded
3450,"A prospective study of 18FDG-PET with CT coregistration for radiation treatment planning of lymphomas and other hematologic malignancies Purpose This prospective single-institution study examined the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of 2-[18F] fluoro-2-deoxyglucose and computed tomography (CT) scan radiation treatment planning (TP) on target volume definition in lymphoma. Methods and Materials 118 patients underwent PET/CT TP during June 2007 to May 2009. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured on CT-only and PET/CT studies by radiation oncologists (ROs) and nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) for 95 patients with positive PET scans. Treatment plans and dose-volume histograms were generated for CT-only and PET/CT for 95 evaluable sites. Paired t test statistics and Pearson correlation coefficients were used for analysis. Results 70 (74%) patients had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10 (11%) had Hodgkin lymphoma, 12 (10%) had plasma-cell neoplasm, and 3 (3%) had other hematologic malignancies. Forty-three (45%) presented with relapsed/refractory disease. Forty-five (47%) received no prior chemotherapy. The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by ROs in 38 patients (median, 27%; range, 5%-70%) and decreased GTV in 41 (median, 39.5%; range, 5%-80%). The addition of PET increased GTV as defined by NMPs in 27 patients (median, 26.5%; range, 5%-95%) and decreased GTV in 52 (median, 70%; range, 5%-99%). The intraobserver correlation between CT-GTV and PET-GTV was higher for ROs than for NMPs (0.94, P<.01 vs 0.89, P<.01). On the basis of Bland-Altman plots, the PET-GTVs defined by ROs were larger than those defined by NMPs. On evaluation of clinical TPs, only 4 (4%) patients had inadequate target coverage (D95 <95%) of the PET-GTV defined by NMPs. Conclusions Significant differences between the RO and NMP volumes were identified when PET was coregistered to CT for radiation planning. Despite this, the PET-GTV defined by ROs and NMPs received acceptable prescription dose in nearly all patients. However, given the potential for a marginal miss, consultation with an experienced PET reader is highly encouraged when PET/CT volumes are delineated, particularly for questionable lesions and to assure complete and accurate target volume coverage. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

4389,"Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP regimen) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus cisplatin in treating locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma Background and Objective: Clinical trials on docetaxel plus cisplatin (DDP) (TP regimen) in treating nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are still uncertain due to limited samples. This study was to compare the short-term efficacy and toxicity of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen versus DDP in treating locally advanced NPC. Method(s): Fifty-seven patients with stage T3-4N2-3M0 NPC diagnosed pathologically from December 2005 to December 2006 were randomized into TP group (30 patients) and DDP group (27 patients). Both groups received TP regimen as induction chemotherapy with docetaxel (70 mg/m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2, repeating every 21 days for two cycles. For concurrent chemotherapy, TP group were administered docetaxel (60 mg/ m2) on Day 1 and DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 2; DDP group were administered DDP (80 mg/m2) on Day 1. Both schedules were repeated every 21 days for two cycles. Linear accelerator was used as radioactive source. Irradiation field was designed with CT-simulation and conventional fractions. Result(s): The 57 patients received 111 cycles of induction chemotherapy, and 53 of them received 103 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy; four patients ceased induction chemotherapy and three ceased concurrent chemotherapy. All patients completed radiotherapy. The major toxicity of induction chemotherapy was hematologic toxicity; the main toxicities of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were hematologic toxicity and mucositis. The occurrence rates of Grade 3-4 leucopenia and Grade 3-4 neutropenia were significantly higher in TP group than in DDP groups (p < 0.05). In concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the application rate of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) was significantly higher in TP group than in DDP group (100% vs. 72.0%, p < 0.05). After concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the complete remission (CR) rates of the nasopharynx and regional lymph nodes were 93.3% and 92.9% in TP group, and were 96.3% and 91.3% in DDP group (p > 0.05). Conclusion(s): The short-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen on locally advanced NPC is similar to that of TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with DDP. The toxicity of the former schedule is severer than that of the latter, but it is tolerable with the use of G-CSF. The long-term efficacy of induction chemotherapy with TP regimen followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy with TP regimen need to be further studied. © 2009 Landes Bioscience.",Excluded
3837,"Establishing the European diagnostic reference levels for interventional cardiology Interventional cardiac procedures may be associated with high patient doses and therefore require special attention to protect the patients from radiation injuries such as skin erythema, cardiovascular tissue reactions or radiation-induced cancer. In this study, patient exposure data is collected from 13 countries (37 clinics and nearly 50 interventional rooms) and for 10 different procedures. Dose data was collected from a total of 14,922 interventional cardiology procedures. Based on these data European diagnostic reference levels (DRL) for air kerma-area product are suggested for coronary angiography (CA, DRL = 35 Gy cm2), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, 85 Gy cm2), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, 130 Gy cm2), electrophysiological procedures (12 Gy cm2) and pacemaker implantations. Pacemaker implantations were further divided into single-chamber (2.5 Gy cm2) and dual chamber (3.5 Gy cm2) procedures and implantations of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (18 Gy cm2). Results show that relatively new techniques such as TAVI and treatment of chronic total occlusion (CTO) often produce relatively high doses, and thus emphasises the need for use of an optimization tool such as DRL to assist in reducing patient exposure. The generic DRL presented here facilitate comparison of patient exposure in interventional cardiology.Copyright © 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Excluded
4189,"The role of barium swallow in the management of the globus pharyngeus Globus pharyngeus is a common benign condition with controversial management. Patients with globus pharyngeus are usually investigated to exclude the possibility of upper aerodiagestive malignancies. There is a great debate about the role of barium swallow in the management of this condition. Review of 1,145 barium swallow repourts of patients presented with globus pharyngeus between 1999 and 2004 has failed to diagnose any patient with pharyngeal or oesophageal cancer. We conclude that barium swallow should not be requested systematically as part of management of globus pharyngeus patients.

3743,"Serial MR Imaging Post Trigeminal Radiosurgery - Identifying Radiosurgical Shot Accuracy in Euclidean Space Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate imaging changes at DREZ target zone post-image guided radiosurgery for medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Materials/Methods: 15 pts. ( 12 male, 3 female) with medically refractory primary TN having BNI class III B & Class IV pain level & history of no prior neurosurgical intervention underwent double reinforced face mask immobilization, 0.625mm slice thickness CT,0.625mm thickness 3D-SPACE, postcontrast VIBE, Diffusion weighted MR sequences. Median dose of 82 gray (80-86gy) was planned on retrogasserian target close to pars triangularis using single isocenter multiarc non-coplanar beams on a Monte-Carlo optimizer. Treatment was delivered using 5mm stereotactic cones with FFF beams at dose rate of 1200mu/mt, 3-D CBCT image guidance, intrafraction imaging and 6-DOF couch. All patients underwent serial MR imaging at time points 72 hrs, 1 week, 1 mo, 3 mo, 6 mo, & 12 mo post SRS. Targeting accuracy was assessed from deviation of the coordinates of the intended target compared with the center of enhancement on 1 month post-SRS MRI. Radiation dose delivered at the borders of contrast enhancement was evaluated. ""Favorable"" responders were patients rendered free of pain, either with or without medications. Complications were defined as lasting neurologic deficits attributable to treatment, and included anesthesia, paresthesia or dysesthesia. Result(s): At median follow-up of 14 mo. pain relief was complete in 13 patients with BNI class 1 response (no medication) and 2 patients BNI had class 2 response (occasional pain not requiring medication). The actuarial rate of obtaining complete pain relief was 93.3%. Imaging changes were same in all the patients post radiosurgery. Nerve edema is seen at 72 hrs post treatment, minimal brainstem edema (nearby DREZ) is noted at 7 days post treatment. Focal enhancement corresponding to SRS shot is seen at 1 month. The enhancement persisted through 6mon. scan but the brainstem edema decreased to pretreatment levels. At 12mo. MR the enhancement faded in intensity. The median deviation of the coordinates between the intended target and the center of contrast enhancement was 0.5 mm (0.3-0.7mm) in Euclidean space. The median radiation doses fitting within the borders of the contrast enhancement of the shot ranged from 78gy. Conclusion(s): Warping original treatment doses on the 1 month post SRS postcontrast MRI gives the clinical team an idea about the accuracy of the treatment and accordingly the errors in treatment. This is the first study reported in literature where serial MR imaging was done post trigeminal radiosurgery.Copyright © 2019",Excluded
3780,"Is there a role for Ytrrium-90 in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma? Background: Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Ytrrium-90 (Y-90) has been used to treat hepatic malignancies with success. This study focuses on the efficacy and safety of Y-90 in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Method(s): A single-institution retrospective case review was performed for patients with unresectable and metastatic ICC treated with Y-90 between 2006 and 2016. Result(s): Seventeen patients with ICC underwent 21 Y-90 treatments. Four patients had undergone prior liver resection, and six patients had extrahepatic disease at the time of treatment. Five year overall survival was 26.8%, with a median survival of 33.6 months. One patient underwent margin negative liver resection after a single treatment. Complications were appreciated in two cases. Ninety-day mortality was 0%. Conclusion(s): Treatment of ICC using Y-90 is a safe and promising procedure. Further research is needed to clarify its role in the treatment of unresectable and metastatic ICC.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4069,"Phase II clinical trial of preoperative combined chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer: preliminary results PURPOSE: Although preoperative chemoradiation for high-risk rectal cancer may improve survival and local recurrence rate, its adverse effects are not well defined. This prospective study evaluated the use of preoperative chemoradiation for T3 and T4 resectable rectal cancer, with special emphasis on treatment morbidity, pathologic remission rate, quality of life, and anorectal function., METHODS: Forty-two patients (30 men, 12 women) were enrolled in the study. Median distance of the distal tumor margin from the anal verge was 6.5 cm. Preoperative staging was based on digital rectal examination, endorectal ultrasound, and computed tomography. None of the patients had distant metastases. All patients had 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/day in 25 fractions) over five weeks, plus 5-fluorouracil (350 mg/m(2)/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/m(2)/day) bolus on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 33. Quality of life was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item quality-of-life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and its colorectal cancer-specific module (QLQ-CR38) questionnaires. Objective anorectal function was assessed by anorectal manometry and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency. Surgery was performed 46 (range, 24-63) days after completion of adjuvant therapy., RESULTS: Nineteen patients (45 percent) had Grade 3 or 4 chemoradiation-induced toxic reactions. Four patients developed intercurrent distant metastases or intraperitoneal carcinomatosis at completion of chemoradiation. Thirty-eight patients underwent surgical resection: abdominoperineal resection, anterior resection, and Hartmann's procedure were performed in 55 percent, 39 percent (11 of 15 patients had a diverting stoma), and 5 percent, respectively. Major surgical complications occurred in 7 patients (18 percent) and included anastomotic leak (n = 1), pelvic abscess (n = 1), small-bowel obstruction (n = 3), and wound breakdown (n = 2). Final pathology was Stage 0 (no residual disease), I, II, and III in 6 (16 percent), 7 (18 percent), 9 (24 percent), and 16 (42 percent) patients, respectively. There was a deterioration, after chemoradiation and surgery, in the quality of life on all subscales assessed, with physical, role, and social function being most severely affected. The symptoms most adversely affected were micturition, defecation, and gastrointestinal problems. Body image and sexual enjoyment deteriorated in both men and women. Chemoradiation alone led to prolonged pudendal nerve terminal motor latency in 57 percent of 7 patients assessed., CONCLUSION: Preliminary results have identified defined costs with preoperative chemoradiation, which included treatment-induced toxicity, a high stoma rate, and adverse effects on quality of life and anorectal function.",Excluded
4182,"Effect of Amifostine to prevent radiotherapy-induced acute and late toxicity in head and neck cancer patients who had normal or mild impaired salivary gland function BACKGROUND: Amifostine has a potential role for salivary gland protection in head and neck cancer patients who had radiotherapy., MATERIAL AND METHOD: Sixty-seven head and neck cancer patients were randomized to receive radiotherapy or radiotherapy plus Amifostine. The efficacy of the treatment was determined by a questionnaire evaluating dryness of mouth and the oral comfort, the RTOG/EORTC acute/late radiation morbidity scoring criteria, collection of the whole saliva and the 99mTc-pertecnetate scintigraphy of the salivary glands., RESULTS: Amifostine significantly reduced the mean questionnaire scores from 6.49 to 3.73, the incidence of grade > or = 2 mucositis from 75% to 36% and acute xerostomia from 82% to 39%. The salivary gland function returned to normal at a rate of 36.3% in the Amifostine group versus 9.1% in the control group., CONCLUSION: Amifostine is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of acute mucositis, acute and late xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients.",Excluded

4108,"Radiation exposure associated with dedicated renal mass computed tomography protocol: impact of patient characteristics BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Renal mass protocol CT (RMP-CT) using multiphase abdomen and pelvis CT imaging is the mainstay for diagnosis, characterization, and follow-up for renal masses; however, it is associated with ionizing radiation to the patient. We sought to quantify the effective dose associated with RMP-CT and to determine how patient factors affect radiation exposure., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 247 patients undergoing management of a small renal mass (cT1a) between 2005 and 2011 at our institution. Body mass index (BMI) was categorized as normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese (<=25, 25.1-30, 30.1-35 and >35, respectively). Effective dose of RMP-CT was calculated through the dose-length-product multiplied by a factor coefficient (0.015). Effective doses in milliSieverts (mSv) were correlated to patient characteristics., RESULTS: Patients' median age was 61 years, and median BMI was 28.7 kg/m(2); 72% were Caucasian and 56% were male. Median effective dose was 26.1 mSv (interquartile range 20.6-35.3). When stratified by BMI, the median effective doses were 18.9, 25.2, 27.7, and 36.2mSv for normal weight, overweight, obese, and morbidly obese patients, respectively. On multivariable analyses, BMI and male sex were significantly associated with increased radiation dose., CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the median effective dose for RMP-CT was 26.1 mSv. Obesity was independently associated with markedly increased radiation exposure, with morbidly obese patients being exposed to almost twice the amount of radiation compared with normal weight persons. These findings should be considered when devising management strategies in patients with a renal mass and strategies should be developed to reduce medical ionizing radiation exposure.",Excluded
3587,"A forgotten moment in physiology: the Lovelace Woman in Space Program (1960-1962) In 1959, Brigadier General Donald Flickinger and Dr. W. Randolph Lovelace II suggested that it would be more practical from an engineering standpoint to send women rather than men into space due to their lower body weights and oxygen requirements. When the Air Force decided not to pursue this project, Dr. Lovelace assumed leadership of the Woman in Space Program and began medical and physiological testing of a series of accomplished women aviators at the Lovelace Medical Clinic in Albuquerque, NM, in 1960. The tests that these women underwent were identical to those used to test the original Mercury astronauts, with the addition of gynecological examinations. Thirteen of the nineteen women tested passed these strenuous physiological exams (for comparison, 18 of 32 men tested passed); a subset of these pilots was further tested on a series of psychological exams that were similar to or, in some instances, more demanding than those given to male Mercury candidates. Despite these promising results, further testing was halted, and the Woman in Space Program was disbanded in 1962. Although the Woman in Space Program received a great deal of publicity at the time, the story of these women was somewhat lost until they were reunited at the 1999 launch of the shuttle Columbia, commanded by Colonel Eileen Collins.",Excluded

Relationships between specific NF-kappaB gene networks, leukemogenesis, and radiation exposure are still unknown. Our aim was to study the expression levels of the NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes in hematological malignancies in the post-Chernobyl period. Material(s) and Method(s): We analyzed gene expression levels of NFkappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel in 49 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 8 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3 acute myeloid leukemia, 3 chronic myeloid leukemia, 2 hairy cell leukemia, 2 myelodysplastic syndrome, and 2 T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia patients using realtime polymerase chain reaction. Result(s): Expression levels of NF-kappaB1, NF-kappaB2, and Rel genes were found to be deregulated.

4170,"Incidence of pseudoprogression in low-grade gliomas treated with radiotherapy Background: As the incidence of pseudo-progressive disease (psPD), or pseudoprogression, in low-grade glioma (LGG) is unknown, we retrospectively investigated this phenomenon in a cohort of LGG patients given radiotherapy (RT)., Methods: All MRI scans and clinical data from patients with histologically proven LGG treated with radiation between 2000 and 2011 were reviewed. PsPD was scored when a new enhancing lesion occurred after RT and subsequently disappeared or remained stable for at least a year without therapy, including dexamethasone., Results: Sixty-three out of 71 patients who received RT for LGG were deemed eligible for evaluation of psPD. The median follow-up was 5 years (range 1-10 y). PsPD was seen in 13 patients (20.6%). PsPD occurred after a median of 12 months with a range of 3-78 months. The median duration of psPD was 6 months, with a range of 2-26 months and always occurred within the RT high dose fields of at least 45 Gy. The area of the enhancement at the time of psPD was significantly smaller compared with the area of enhancement during ""true"" progression (median size 54mm2 [range 12-340mm2] vs 270mm2 [range 30-3420mm2], respectively; P = .009)., Conclusions: PsPD occurs frequently in LGG patients receiving RT. This supports the policy to postpone a new line of treatment until progression is evident, especially when patients have small contrast enhancing lesions within the RT field.

Method(s): We retrospectively evaluated the outcome of nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NMA) in patients with multiple myeloma treated at the Department of Haematology of the University Medical Centre Utrecht. Thirty-six patients received NMA as part of the first-line treatment; 23 patients as part of salvage therapy. Conditioning regimen was low-dose total body irradiation (TBI, 2 Grays) only; fludarabine was added in patients without previous autologous stem cell transplantation and patients with matched unrelated donors received antithymocyte globulin in addition to fludarabine and TBI. Result(s): Following NMA overall response increased from 84 to 90%, complete remission rate from 15 to 32%. As part of first-line treatment NMA induced complete remission in 50% of patients vs one patient (4%) treated for relapsed multiple myeloma. Median progression-free survival was 26 months (13 months for the salvage group, 38 months for the 'upfront' patients). Median overall survival has not been reached yet. The achievement of complete remission following NMA as part of first-line treatment was associated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival. Major toxicities were acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease occurring in 64% (23% grade 3-4) and in 54% (49% extensive) patients, respectively. Seven patients (12%) died from nonrelapse mortality, five patients (9%) directly related to toxicity of NMA. Conclusion(s): NMA in multiple myeloma is feasible, is associated with acceptable nonrelapse mortality and may induce prolonged complete remission. In pretreated patients the result of NMA is disappointing which urges new strategies. © 2007 Van Zuiden Communications B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3490,"Value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by diffusion-weighted MRI for predicting pathological stages and therapeutic responses to chemoradiotherapy in lower rectal cancer Aim: Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has the potential to reveal intra-tumor structural heterogeneity consisting of stroma through an evaluation of uniformity on DWI. In present study, we examined the diagnostic value of intra-tumor heterogeneity evaluated by DWI in lower rectal cancer (LRC). Patients and Methods: A total of 172 LRC patients underwent radical surgery between 2009 and 2017. T1 tumors and cases without pre-operative MRI were excluded. Twenty-nine primary resection cases (PR) and 37 pre-operative chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery cases (pCRT) were targeted. Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI was quantified using a specific formula (HSD). Structural heterogeneity was objectively quantified by an image analysis of resected specimens using a digital microscope (HSP). The relationships between HSD and HSP, pathological factors, and tumor regression grades (TRG) of pCRT were evaluated. Result(s): The relationship between HSD and HSP was analyzed by a linear regression model in PR cases, revealing a positive correlation (R2=0.43). PR cases were divided into HSD-high and HSD-low according to the median. There were more pT3 or N(+) cases in HSD-high (p=0.038, 0.095). HSD before pCRT correlated with TRG (grade 1 versus 2/3) in pCRT cases (p=0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of HSD for predicting T and N stages and therapeutic grades was evaluated by cut-off values calculated using a ROC curve and revealed that each factor may be accurately diagnosed. Conclusion(s): Intra-tumor heterogeneity on DWI corresponded with stromal pathological heterogeneity. It is useful for predicting T3 or deeper tumor invasion, pathological N(+), and the therapeutic effects of pCRT.Copyright © The author(s).",Excluded
4362,"Endovascular Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Obstruction: Comparison of Efficacy Between Stent Alone and Stent Combined With Linear Radioactive Seeds Strand Objectives: To investigate the safety and efficacy of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds to treat malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed the data of 57 patients with malignant cancer-associated venous obstruction. Nineteen patients underwent the placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds (group A), and 38 patients underwent the placement of a bare stent (group B). The following parameters were compared between the 2 groups of patients: symptom relief rate, duration of venous patency, survival time, quality of life, and adverse events. Result(s): A total of 34 stents and 527 seeds were implanted in group A, while a total of 57 stents were implanted in group B. The surgery success rate was 96.5%, and no serious complication related to the surgery was reported. Symptoms of venous obstruction improved significantly after surgery. The score of group A decreased from 14.74 +/- 0.562 points before surgery to 2.79 +/- 1.357 points after surgery(P <.001), and the score of group B decreased from 13.79 +/- 1.398 points before surgery to 5.55 +/- 3.674 points after surgery (P <.001). The patency rate of group A was significantly higher than that of group B at 1 to 6 months after surgery (100%, 84.2%, 68.4%, 63.2%, 36.8%, 21.1% vs 68.4%, 23.7%, 18.4%, 7.9%, 5.3%, 2.6%, respectively; P <.05). Before treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score between the groups (P =.791). After 1 to 6 months of treatment, the KPS score was significantly higher in group A than in group B (P =.013). The median patency duration in groups A and B was 125 days (95% CI: 80.018-169.982) and 35 days (95% CI: 20.501-49.499), respectively (P <.001). The median survival time of group A was 155 days (95% CI: 110.406-199.594), and that of group B was 98 days (95% CI: 55.712-140.288; P =.325). Multivariate analysis showed that the implantation of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds and the KPS score (>=80 points) were independent factors of long-term patency after stent placement. Conclusion(s): The placement of a stent combined with a linear strand of 125I seeds is a safe and effective treatment for venous obstruction caused by malignant tumors. This treatment provides prolonged patency compared with the placement of bare stent, and while it does not significantly improve the survival time of patients, it can improve their quality of life.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.",Excluded
3850,Postoperative X-ray chest after supracostal puncture: Mandatory after every case of percutaneous nephrolithotomy? Introduction and Objective: It is a routine practice to get postoperative X-ray done after supracostal access in PCNL. Although the incidence of hydro-pneumothorax is very less and routine X-ray chest unnecessarily increase the radiation exposure to patients. The aim of our study was to assess the role of postoperative X-ray chest after supra costal puncture in PCNL for the detection and management of pneumothorax and/or hydrothorax. Material(s) and Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 347 patients who underwent PCNL at our institute between Jan. 2007 and February 2011. 66.6% were male and 33.4% were female. Out of 347 PCNL supracostal upper calyceal puncture was done in 102 patients: 54 on right side and 48 on left side. In 23 patients three punctures were made and 31 patients required two tracts for complete stone clearance. Result(s): All punctures were done between 11-12th intercostal space and all patients underwent a post operative X-ray chest. In 1 patient hydro pneumothorax was detected which improved after intercostal chest tube drainage. One patient had mild pleural effusion which was managed conservatively. Both these patients had complaint of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period. In rest of the patients chest X-rays were normal and had no respiratory discomfort in post operative period. Conclusion(s): Routine post operative X-ray chest is not mandatory after every PCNL with supracostal access. When intra-operative pneumothorax is suspected or patient complain of respiratory difficulty in postoperative period then X-ray chest should be done.,Excluded
4284,"Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and dosimetry of 99Tcm(V)DMSA in humans with squamous cell carcinoma Technetium-99m (99Tcm)(V) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour imaging agent which has been used to evaluate squamous carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 99Tcm(V)DMSA in patients with SCC and calculated the bone mass of a New Zealand White (NZW) rabbit. This data was then used to calculate the effective dose equivalent in man. A total of 16 patients were studied (5 with no tumour, 11 with tumour). 99Tcm(V)DMSA had a fast bi-exponential blood clearance in patients with no tumour (30 and 401 min) and patients with tumour (30 and 387 min) with no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) between the two groups. 99Tcm(V)DMSA had a fast cumulative urine excretion with mean half-times in non-tumour and tumour patients of 183 min and 244 min respectively. There was no significant difference (p greater than 0.05) between these two latter groups. The effective dose equivalent of 99Tcm(V)DMSA in man is 5.1 microSv/MBq.",Excluded
4314,"A randomized trial comparing levothyroxine with radioactive iodine in the treatment of sporadic nontoxic goiter A randomized clinical trial was performed in consecutive patients with sporadic nontoxic nodular goiter to compare efficacy and side effects of iodine-131 (131I) therapy with suppressive levothyroxine (L-thyroxine) treatment. Sixty-four patients were randomized after stratification for sex and menopausal age to receive 131I (4.44 MBq/g thyroid; group A) or suppressive L-thyroxine treatment aiming at TSH values between 0.01 and 0.1 mU/L (group B). The main outcome measurements after 2 yr were goiter size by ultrasound, serum thyroid function tests, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density (BMD). Fifty-seven patients completed the trial. Goiter size was reduced after 2 yr by 44% in group A and by 1% in group B (P < 0.001). Nonresponders (goiter reduction < 13%)were 1 of 29 patients in group A and 16 of 28 patients in group B (P = 0.00001). In responders, goiter reduction in group A (46%) was greater than in group B (22%; P < 0.005). In group A, 45% of patients developed hypothyroidism. In group B, 10 patients experienced thyrotoxic symptoms, requiring discontinuation of treatment in 2 (in 1 because of atrial fibrillation). Markers of bone formation and bone resorption increased significantly in group B, related to a mean decrease of 3.6% of BMD at the lumbar spine after 2 yr (from 1.09 +/- 0.22 to 1.05 +/- 0.23 g/cm2; P < 0.001), both in pre- and postmenopausal women. No changes in BMD were observed in group A. In conclusion, 131I therapy is more effective and better tolerated than L-thyroxine treatment in patients with sporadic nontoxic goiter. Suppressive L-thyroxine treatment results in significant bone loss.",Excluded
4173,"Early clinical outcomes for 3 radiation techniques for brain metastases: Focal versus whole-brain Purpose: To present our novel technique for brain metastases (low-dose whole brain radiation therapy [WBRT] with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) and focal, frameless stereotactic intensity modulated radiotherapy [IMRT]) in the context of patterns of failure, dosimetry, acute toxicity, and overall survival for 3 different radiation techniques. Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 92 patients undergoing radiation for brain metastases via the following: (1) ""prophylactic"" WBRT to a low dose (median 30 Gy) with an SIB to the gross tumor volume plus 2-3 mm margin (median dose 45 Gy) in 10-15 fractions; (2) focal, frameless image-guided stereotactic IMRT (S-IMRT) in 5 fractions to tumor only (median 30 Gy); or (3) conventional (c)WBRT using 2 lateral opposed beams in 10-15 fractions (30-37.5 Gy). The primary endpoints were local (LBC), distant (DBC), and total brain control (TBC) for each of the 3 types of brain radiation. Survival, toxicity, and dosimetry were reported as secondary endpoints. Result(s): LBC was achieved in 72%, 78%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. DBC (ie, no new brain metastases) was observed in 92%, 67%, and 81% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. TBC (LBC + DBC) was 72%, 67%, and 56% for SIB, S-IMRT, and cWBRT, respectively. No statistical difference in overall survival was observed (P = .067), and only 1 patient experienced biopsy proven radionecrosis. Conclusion(s): TBC after low-dose WBRT with SIB was acceptable and at least comparable to S-IMRT and cWBRT. SIB seems to be a safe and effective treatment strategy for patients with brain metastases and may efficiently combine the benefits of cWBRT and stereotactic radiosurgery. © 2011 American Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
3990,"Neoadjuvant gemcitabine-based accelerated hyperfractionation chemoradiotherapy for patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma Objective: We report the response to pre-operative gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Method(s): Thirty-five consecutive patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma of UICC Stage II or III with portal vein invasion or tumor abutment of artery received radiotherapy (twice daily fractions of 1.5 Gy, 5 days/week, total dose: 36 Gy; 30 Gy for Phase I Level 1) with weekly intravenous infusions of gemcitabine (400, 600 and 800 mg/m2) at Days 1 and 8 forPhase I and 800 mg/m2 for Phase II. Restaging was repeated after completion of chemoradiotherapy. Result(s): Twenty-six of the 35 (74.3%) patients underwent resection. The dose-limiting toxicities were Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. The recommended regimen was total radiation dose of 36 Gy with gemcitabine 800 mg/m2. Surgical resection was conducted in 11 of the 15 (73.3%) patients in Phase I study and 15 of the 20 (75.0%) in Phase II. After recommended dose chemoradiotherapy and surgical resection, the median disease-free survival was 17.4 months (5-year survival rate = 14.3%). The median overall survival time and 5-year survival rate were 41.2 months and 28.6%, respectively, for the 21 patients who underwent resection and 10.0 months and 0%, respectively, for those 5 who did not (P = 0.004). Conclusion(s): Our pre-operative gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy was well tolerated and safe.Copyright © The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3576,"Novel mutation in keratin 10 causing autosomal dominant epidermolytic ichthyosis Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI; OMIM 113800), previously termed bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma or epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, is a clinically heterogeneous disorder of keratinization caused by mutations in either of the KRT1 or KRT10 genes, which encode the suprabasal keratins K1 and K10, respectively. The condition is usually characterized clinically by severe neonatal erythroderma, blistering and fragile skin, with the subsequent development of generalized hyperkeratosis. Usually mutations are missense substitutions in the highly conserved alpha-helical rod domains of these keratins, which play a critical role in filament formation. The presence of palmoplantar keratoderma is suggestive of KRT1 mutations, whereas KRT10 mutations are associated with palmoplantar sparing. We report a seven-generation kindred with EI due to a novel mutation in KRT10. A 32-year-old woman presented with widespread ichthyosis and erythema affecting her trunk and limbs. She gave a history of scaling and erythroderma since birth but no blistering, erosions or collodion membrane. She had been maintained on oral isotretinoin 20-40 mg once daily from the age of 13 years, but had recently developed lower-back and hip pain. Examination revealed widespread fine scaling and erythema over the trunk and limbs with more significant hyperkeratosis at the elbows, knees and ankles. There was relative sparing of the palmoplantar skin. Her father, uncle and grandmother were more severely affected, but none was receiving oral retinoids. Four further generations were recorded as affected. Histology of affected elbow and upper-arm skin demonstrated acanthosis, marked overlying hyperkeratosis, vacuolar change of the upper epidermal cells in the upper epidermis with prominent clumping of keratohyaline granules and abnormal eosinophilic cytoplasm. X-rays of the lower lumbar spine and left hip demonstrated bridging osteophytes T11-L1 and flattening of the left femoral head, with magnetic resonance imaging confirming the presence of avascular necrosis. This required treatment with a left core decompression of the left hip, with good results. Mutation screening of KRT10 identified a novel heterozygous deletion extending from intron 5 into exon 6 (designated K10 c.1156-79- 1243del), abolishing the exon 6 acceptor splice site, resulting in a shorter aberrant K10 protein lacking a sequence motif critically important for keratin filament assembly. The mutation was present in her affected father. This finding adds to the evidence that K10 mutations are the principal cause of autosomal dominant EI with palmoplantar sparing. It also highlights the possible side-effects of long-term oral retinoid treatment in these inherited conditions.",Excluded
4228,"Radiosurgery of vestibular schwannoma: prognostic factors for hearing outcome using 3D-constructive interference in steady state (3D-CISS) Purpose: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an effective treatment for vestibular schwannoma (VS). Three-dimensional (3D) constructive interference in steady state (CISS) is the preferred magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence for evaluating signal changes in the inner ear endolymph. Previous studies demonstrated a correlation between pretreatment cochlear signal intensity in 3D-CISS and posttherapeutic hearing outcomes. The purpose of our study was to compare 3D-CISS sequences before and after primary SRS of unilateral VSs to evaluate the effect of radiosurgery on the 3D-CISS signal intensities of cochlea and sacculus/utriculus. Method(s): We retrospectively reviewed 47 patients with unilateral VS treated with SRS. The neuroradiological MRI datasets were analysed to evaluate the signal intensity of the inner ear structure, tumour size, Koos grade, tumour volume, and infiltration of the cochlear aperture before therapy and at follow-up. The differences in these signal intensities before SRS and at follow-up were correlated with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume and infiltration of the cochlear aperture. Result(s): No differences were found between signal intensities in cochlea and utriculus/sacculus before and after SRS and no correlation with clinical symptoms, cochlear radiation dose, tumour volume, Koos grade or infiltration of the cochlear aperture (all p> 0.05). Conclusion(s): Our study supports the theory of a complex interaction causing alteration of the endolymph protein concentration and not a direct dependency on the SRS. Use of modern dosing schemes will have a positive impact on clinical outcome with preservation of hearing in patients with VS.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
4145,"Optic Nerve Sheath Meningioma: Visual Improvement During Radiation Treatment Purpose: To describe four patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma in whom visual improvement began to occur even before completion of a standard course of radiation therapy. Design(s): Retrospective case review. Method(s): A review was conducted of 35 patients who received stereotactic three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for optic nerve sheath meningioma from 1990 to 2005. Result(s): Four patients with radiographic confirmation of optic nerve sheath meningioma were identified who had neuro-ophthalmologic assessment, which included perimetry, either while radiation treatment was underway or immediately afterwards. All of the patients showed improvement in visual acuity and visual fields. Conclusion(s): A rapid response to radiation therapy may occur in some patients with optic nerve sheath meningioma. In such patients, it may be possible to customize the radiation dose by assessing of visual function during the course of therapy. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4573,"Epidemiological features of brain tumors Brain tumors account for 1.4% of all cancers and 2.4% of all cancer-related deaths. The incidence of brain tumors varies and it is higher in developed countries of Western Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. In Serbia, according to data from 2009, malignant brain tumors account for 2.2 of all tumors, and from all cancer-related deaths, 3.2% is caused by malignant brain tumors. According to recent statistical reports, an overall incidence of brain tumors for benign and malignant tumors combined is 18.71 per 100,000 persons/year. The most common benign brain tumor in adults is meningioma, which is most present in women, and the most common malignant tumor is glioblastoma, which is most present in adult men. Due to high mortality, especially in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma and significant brain tumor morbidity, there is a constant interest in understanding its etiology in order to possibly prevent tumor occurrence in future and enable more efficient treatment strategies for this fatal brain disease. Despite the continuously growing number of epidemiological studies on possible factors of tumor incidence, the etiology remains unclear. The only established environmental risk factor of gliomas is ionizing radiation exposure. Exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields via cell phone use has gained a lot of attention as a potential risk factor of brain tumor development. However, studies have been inconsistent and inconclusive, so more definite results are still expected.",Excluded
4368,"Treatment and prognosis of brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer: A retrospective study Background and objective: Now the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with brain metastasis is not a standard program. The aim of this study is to summarize the factors related to survival of patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. Method(s): A total of 111 NSCLC patients with brain metastases (from September 1995-May 2004) were defined as symptomatic group (37 patients) and asymptomatic group (74 patients) according to central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. The patients in the symptomatic group were given whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT, DT 30-40 Gy/20 f) first, and then received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The patients in the asymptomatic group were given cisplatin-based chemotherapy first, and then received WBRT. During the treatment, 49 patients received chemotherapy of BCNU or VM-26 irregularly. Result(s): The median survival time was 11 months. The 1- and 2-year survival rate was 40.79% and 13.26% respectively. The survival time was not significantly different between the symptomatic group and asymptomatic group. Median chemotherapy of asymptomatic group was 3 cycles (1-6 cycles) before WBRT. Those patients who received 3 or 4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT had better survival (P = 0.0188, P = 0.0035). The treatment of BCNU or VM-26 was a benefit factor for survival (P = 0.0219) in asymptomatic group. The hematologic toxicity of grade III or IV was not significantly different between the two groups (P>0.05). The number of brain metastasis (P = 0.000), extracranial metastasis (P = 0.022) and WHO performance status (P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion(s): The patients with asymptomatic brain metastases receive 3-4 cycles of chemotherapy before WBRT may be reasonable. During the therapy, the patients with administration of BCNU or VM-26 may have survival benefit.",Excluded
3631,"Impacts of antibiotics on in vitro UVA-susceptibility of human skin fibroblasts Many studies of UVA-induced cell damage use skin cells obtained during plastic surgery. As the skin is contaminated by micro-organisms, antibiotics need to be added to primary skin cell culture media. This study analysed the impact of the most widely used agents, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin B deoxycholate (amB), on UVA-irradiated human skin fibroblasts. The results show that the presence of amB in cell culture media increases the susceptibility of fibroblasts to UVA and the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species, even when cells are irradiated in amB-free saline. This photosensitising effect of amB can be prevented if the antifungal agent is removed from the culture medium at least 24 hours before irradiation. Moreover, the use of streptomycin during cell culture partly protects cells against the UVA-induced mortality linked to amB. Acellular tests on lipid micelles suggest that this protective effect could result from an inhibition of lipid peroxidation by the antibacterial agent. In conclusion, antibiotics should be used with care in cell culture media if the cells are to be used in physiological studies of fine mechanisms in UVA-susceptibility of skin cells. In other cases, cells should be maintained in antibiotic-free media for 24 hours before irradiation.",Excluded
4323,"SAR values of mobile phones. Safety evaluation and risk perception The specific absorption rate (SAR) is a prominent topic in the discussion about precautionary health protection. An experimental study investigated the effect of information about various SAR values (below the existing partial body limit value of 2 W/kg) on safety judgments of potential mobile phones users. It turns out that about 94% of the participants do not know the SAR value of their own mobile phone. SAR values below existing limits are not perceived as equally safe. Rather, the lower the SAR value, the higher the perceived safety. However, a majority of the participants does not consider these SAR values to be 100% safe, even if they are clearly below the existing limits. Explicitly indicating a precautionary limit value (referring to the Federal Office for Radiation Protection or to consumer organizations) does not change this safety evaluation. As expected, safety evaluation of the SAR values is also related to the perception of mobile phone risks. Those who are concerned about mobile phone communication give lower safety judgments than the unconcerned-independent of the level of the SAR values. Irrespective of that, our results suggest that establishing the SAR value as a criterion for mobile phones depends first of all on making it known to the public.",Excluded
4273,"Long-term quality of life and tumour control following gamma knife radiosurgery for vestibular schwannoma Introduction: Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) has for the last decades been an established treatment option for patients with small- or medium-sized vestibular schwannomas (VS), although little data is reported on long-term outcome regarding quality of life (QOL) and tumour control in this patient category. The objective of this study was to investigate long-term QOL and tumour control in GKRS-treated VS patients at our institution. Method(s): Data was reviewed from a consecutive cohort of 128 patients, 62 men and 66 women, diagnosed with VS and treated with GKRS at Karolinska University Hospital between 1997 and 2003. Patients previously treated for VS, patients from abroad, and patients with neurofibromatosis were excluded from the study. Median age at the time of treatment was 66 years (range 23-89), with a median follow-up time of 104 months (range 11-165) and radiological median follow-up of 86 months (range 5-170). Five patients were lost to follow-up. Result(s): Data on QOL (EQ-5D score) was obtained in 90 % (98/109) of all cases at the end of follow-up, showing low morbidity and a high QOL with median index of 0.91 (max. score 1.0) in these patients. Tumour control was achieved in 92 % (118/128) of patients after a single GKRS treatment. Ten patients had loss of tumour control, either radiologically seen as growth progression, or due to the need for salvage treatment. Neither pre-treatment growth of the vestibular schwannoma, or a large tumour size (Koos grade 3 & 4) was correlated with a higher degree of treatment failure (p = 0.695 and p = 0.647, respectively). There was no difference in tumour control in young (<60 y/o) vs. elderly (>=60 y/o) patients (p = 0.167). Conclusion(s): We report a high QOL and low morbidity at long-term follow-up after GKRS treatment in VS patients. Furthermore, a high tumour control rate was achieved independent of tumour size, patient age or pre-treatment evidence of tumour growth. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded
4466,"Radiation-dose response of glycophorin A somatic mutation in erythrocytes associated with gene polymorphisms of p53 binding protein 1 Information on individual variations in response to ionizing radiation is still quite limited. Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4329,"Individually adapted examination protocols for reduction of radiation exposure in chest CT RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To develop a simple directive for the reduction of radiation exposure without loss of diagnostic information in routine chest CT examinations., METHODS: Two hundred fifty adult patients (164 male, 86 female) were entered into a prospective trial. All examinations were performed with a multislice CT technique (Somatom Volume Zoom, Siemens). Four groups of 50 patients each were scanned with patient-related specific parameters: individual mA-s values were derived from the estimated body weight: kilograms + 10, +/- 0, - 10, and - 20 mAs. The results were compared with those of 50 patients who were examined by a standard chest protocol by using the parameters 120 mAs and 140 kV. All other parameters including the tube voltage were kept constant. Subjective image quality was rated on a three-point scale: 1 = excellent, 2 = fair, 3 = nondiagnostic. In addition, objective criteria based on signal-to-noise measurements were assessed by using a region-of-interest methodology., RESULTS: Image quality was sufficient in all cases. Mean subjective gradings of image quality, based on soft-tissue window settings, were 1.1 for the 120-mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] + 10) mAs protocol, 1.1 for the (body weight [kg] +/- 0) mAs protocol, 1.3 for the (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs protocol, and 1.2 for the (body weight [kg] - 20) mAs protocol. Objective criteria based on noise measurements showed mean +/- standard deviation values of 5.7 +/- 0.8 Hounsfield units (HU) for the 120-mAs protocol. For the reduced-dose protocols, values were calculated as 7.6 +/- 1.2 HU (group + 10), 7.9 +/- 1.3 HU (group +/- 0), 8.7 +/- 1.2 HU (group - 10), and finally 9.1 +/- 1.3 HU (group - 20). The best correlation for an entire subgroup was achieved with the - 10 protocol (body weight [kg] - 10) mAs, with nearly constant noise related to body weight in all patients., CONCLUSIONS: By deriving mAs values from body weight estimation, an individually adapted protocol for chest CT can be recommended and easily employed in a clinical setting. With an adaptation of the tube current-time product based on the estimated body weight of the patient - 10 (body weight [kg] - 10 mAs), a well-balanced examination without significant loss of information, even in soft-tissue window settings, can be performed with this particular scanner. For this adapted mAs protocol, a mean reduction of radiation exposure of 45% was achievable, compared with the standard protocol. A maximum decrease per case down to 31 mAs was obtained, without relevant loss of image quality. Therefore, for other types of CT scanners, analogous protocols may be adapted.",Excluded
4418,"Optimal scan parameters for ct fluoroscopy in lung interventional radiologic procedures: Relationship between radiation dose and image quality Purpose: To evaluate the relationship between radiation doses and lung computed tomographic (CT) fluoroscopic scan parameters and to determine optimal scan parameters for performance of lung interventional radiologic (IR) procedures. Material(s) and Method(s): The institutional review board approved this prospective study, which included 32 patients with a single lung tumor;written informed consent was obtained. CT fluoroscopic images were obtained with three tube voltages (80,120,135 kV) and three tube currents (10, 20, 30 mA) in each patient. The signal-to-noise ratios(SNRs) and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were measured quantitatively. To evaluate the feasibility of performing lung IR procedures, four readers visually scored the image quality. Acceptable CT fluoroscopic images were determined by using agreement of at least three of the four readers. The weighted CT dose index for each CT scan parameter was measured. A piecewise linear regression equation was obtained from the relationship between radiation doses and visual image scores. Result(s): Both the SNR and the CNR improved as the radiation dose increased, leading to improvement in the image quality. Acceptable image quality was achieved in 94% (30 of 32) of patients when the radiation dose was 1.18 mGy/sec (120 kV, 10 mA) and in all patients when it was greater than 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). The piecewise linear curve showed rapid improvement in image quality until the radiation dose increased to 1.48 mGy/sec (135 kV, 10 mA). When the radiation dose was increased greater than 1.48 mGy/sec, improvement in the image quality became more gradual. Conclusion(s): Results of this study can be used to guide the determination of optimal scan parameters in lung CT fluoroscopy. © RSNA, 2010.",Excluded
4147,"Patient-reported voice and speech outcomes after whole-neck intensity modulated radiation therapy and chemotherapy for oropharyngeal cancer: Prospective longitudinal study Purpose To describe voice and speech quality changes and their predictors in patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated on prospective clinical studies of organ-preserving chemotherapy-intensity modulated radiation therapy (chemo-IMRT). Methods and Materials Ninety-one patients with stage III/IV oropharyngeal cancer were treated on 2 consecutive prospective studies of definitive chemoradiation using whole-field IMRT from 2003 to 2011. Patient-reported voice and speech quality were longitudinally assessed from before treatment through 24 months using the Communication Domain of the Head and Neck Quality of Life (HNQOL-C) instrument and the Speech question of the University of Washington Quality of Life (UWQOL-S) instrument, respectively. Factors associated with patient-reported voice quality worsening from baseline and speech impairment were assessed. Results Voice quality decreased maximally at 1 month, with 68% and 41% of patients reporting worse HNQOL-C and UWQOL-S scores compared with before treatment, and improved thereafter, recovering to baseline by 12-18 months on average. In contrast, observer-rated larynx toxicity was rare (7% at 3 months; 5% at 6 months). Among patients with mean glottic larynx (GL) dose <=20 Gy, >20-30 Gy, >30-40 Gy, >40-50 Gy, and >50 Gy, 10%, 32%, 25%, 30%, and 63%, respectively, reported worse voice quality at 12 months compared with before treatment (P=.011). Results for speech impairment were similar. Glottic larynx dose, N stage, neck dissection, oral cavity dose, and time since chemo-IMRT were univariately associated with either voice worsening or speech impairment. On multivariate analysis, mean GL dose remained independently predictive for both voice quality worsening (8.1%/Gy) and speech impairment (4.3%/Gy). Conclusions Voice quality worsening and speech impairment after chemo-IMRT for locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer were frequently reported by patients, underrecognized by clinicians, and independently associated with GL dose. These findings support reducing mean GL dose to as low as reasonably achievable, aiming at <=20 Gy when the larynx is not a target. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3753,"Lower urinary tract function after intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy for invasive bladder cancer BACKGROUND: Intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy as a bladder-sparing regimen for invasive bladder cancer is highly promising for selected patients. However, lower urinary tract function after this treatment has not been fully investigated. METHOD(S): The urodynamic effects of intra-arterial chemotherapy with concurrent pelvic radiotherapy were retrospectively evaluated in 14 patients with organ-confined invasive bladder cancer. The post-treatment urodynamic findings were compared with the pretreatment ones (n = 7), and a comparison was made between the serial urodynamic findings after the treatment in another seven patients who were able to undergo the pretreatment urodynamic study (UDS). RESULT(S): The median follow-up period up to the latest UDS was 34 months. Of the 14 patients, the latest UDS revealed some storage dysfunctions in 11 (79%) and some emptying dysfunctions in three (23%). Uninhibited detrusor contraction and decreased bladder compliance were recorded in 29 and 43% at the pretreatment UDS and approximately 50-60 and 20-60% in the serial follow-up studies, respectively (n = 7). Impaired detrusor contractility lasted in one patient. In the seven patients without the pretreatment UDS, decreased maximum cystometric capacity and decreased compliance were recorded in approximately 50-60 and 20-60% at the serial UDS, respectively. Detrusor contractility was aggravated in one patient and completely lost in one with time. CONCLUSION(S): The urodynamic findings indicate that the bladder-sparing regimen might result in perpetuating the lower urinary tract dysfunctions due to invasive bladder cancer itself and/or transurethral surgery and might injure the infrasacral autonomic nerves and the bladder itself.",Excluded

Result(s): The patients showed normal baseline test results (IQ = 101 +/- 14, attention = 54 +/- 28) and no decrease in test results after 1.2 Gy TBI. Attention functions improved (66 +/- 25) corresponding to a practice effect of repeated testing that was seen in the control group, although alternate versions of the tests were used (IQ = 104 +/- 10, attention before = 42 +/- 29, attention after = 52 +/- 31). Conclusion(s): Our data show no deterioration of neuropsychologic test results acutely after 1.2 Gy whole body exposure in adult patients without CNS disease receiving antiemetic medication.",Excluded
3854,"Mean or median values of acoustic radiation force impulse elastography: Which one to use in clinical practice? Background: Acoustic radiation force impulse elastography (ARFI) is a new ultrasound based method for the non-invasive evaluation of liver fibrosis. The aim of our paper was to find out which one, the mean or then median values of ARFI measurements, is the most accurate for liver stiffness (LS) evaluation. Patients and Methods: Our study included 179 subjects (92 females and 87 males, mean age 46.9+/-15.9): 69 subjects without fibrosis (healthy volunteers - considered F0 Metavir), 8 subjects with F1, 25 subjects with F2, 24 patients with F3 (all patients underwent liver biopsy) and 53 patients with liver cirrhosis (16 with liver biopsy and 37 with clinically, ultrasonographic and/or endoscopic signs of cirrhosis). In each patient we performed ARFI (by using a Siemens Acuson S2000TM ultrasound system) and: 10 measurements (mean and median values were calculated, measured in meters/second). We compared the diagnostic performance of ARFI mean and median values. Result(s): A direct, strong, linear correlation (Spearman rho=0.663) was found between median ARFI measurements and fibrosis (p<0.0001), as well as between mean ARFI measurements and fibrosis (rho=0.655) (p<0.0001). There were not statistically significant differences between the predictive values of mean and median values of ARFI measurements for significant fibrosis (F>=2 Metavir), severe fibrosis (F>=3 Metavir) and cirrhosis, as seen in the following table: Conclusion(s): For ARFI evaluation of liver fibrosis, mean or median values can probably be used with the same diagnostic performances.

3497,"The relative frequency in which empiric dosages of radioiodine would potentially overtreat or undertreat patients who have metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer The dosage of (131)I for the treatment of metastatic well-differentiated thyroid cancer is typically selected empirically. Benua and Leeper implemented a method to estimate the maximum dosages of (131)I that could be administered to a patient so as not to exceed a maximum tolerated radiation absorbed dose (MTD), which was defined as 200 rads (cGy) to the blood. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of (131)I treatments in which the patient (1) would have exceeded the MTD (i.e., overtreatment) or (2) would have been able to receive higher dosages of (131)I thereby delivering a potentially higher radiation absorbed dose to their metastases (i.e., undertreatment) had the patient been administered various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. The dosimetrically-determined maximum tolerated radioactivities (MTA) to deliver 200 rads to the blood (MTD) were tabulated at our facility. Data were then grouped to determine the percentage of patients who would have received less than or more than the MTD for various assumed empiric dosages of (131)I. A total of 127 dosimetries were performed. For assumed empiric dosages of (131)I (100 mCi, 150 mCi, 200 mCi, 250 mCi, and 300 mCi), the percentage of treatments for which patients would have exceeded the MTD were less than 1%, 5%, 11%, 17%, and 22%, respectively, and could have received a higher dosage of (131)I were more than 99%, 95%, 89%, 83%, and 78%, respectively. A significant number of patients receiving various empiric dosages of (131)I may exceed 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential overtreating). Likewise, the majority of patients may be able to receive much higher dosages of (131)I relative to empiric dosages thereby delivering potentially higher radiation absorbed doses to the metastases without exceeding 200 rads (cGy) to the blood (potential undertreating).",Excluded
3821,"Multifaceted applications of pre-mature chromosome condensation in radiation biodosimetry Background: Biodosimetry with persistent cytogenetic indicators in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) plays crucial role in regulatory/medical management of individuals overexposed to radiation. Conventional methods require ~48 h culture and have limited dose range (0.1-5Gy) applications due to checkpoint arrest/poor stimulation. G0-Phase Premature chromosome condensation (G0-PCC) allows chromosome aberration analysis within hours after blood collection. Due to high skill demand, applications of G0-PCC were not very well explored and being re-visited worldwide. Among all aberrations, analysis of excess chromosomal fragments is quickest. Radiation dose response curve for the fragments has been reported. Purpose(s): In present study, excess fragment analysis has been addressed in detail, in addition to validation of radiation dose response curve, gender variation in the response, dose dependent repair kinetics, minimum detection limit (MDL), duration and accuracy of final dose estimation with 5blindfolded, ex vivo irradiated samples have been studied. In extension, feasibility of multiparametric dosimetry with Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based endpoints were qualitatively explored. Material(s) and Method(s): PBLs were exposed to Gamma-Radiation and G0-PCC was performed at different time points. Decay kinetics and dose response curve were established. Gender Variation of the frequency of the fragments was assessed at 0, 2 and 4 Gy. FISH was performed with G0-PCC applying centromere probe, whole chromosome paints, multi-color FISH and multi-color banding probes. Result(s): Radiation response curve for fragments was found to be linear (Slope 1.09 +/- 0.031 Gy-1). Background frequency as well as dose response did not show significant gender bias. Based on variation in background frequency of fragments MDL was calculated to be ~0.3 Gy. Kinetics of fragment tested at 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h showed exponential decay pattern from 0 to 8 h and without further decay. Final dose estimation of five samples was completed within 13 man-hours. Dicentric chromosomes, translocations, insertions and breaks were identifiable in combination with centromere FISH and WCP. Advanced methods employing multicolor FISH and multi-color banding were also demonstrated with PCC spreads. Conclusion(s): G0-PCC, can be useful tool for high dose biodosimetry with quick assessment of fragment frequency. Further, it holds potential for multi-parametric dosimetry in combination with FISH.© Copyright © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group LLC.",Included

The course of symptoms was documented over 8 instillations at maximum, covering a period of approximately three months. All main symptoms of chronic cystitis declined consistently and statistically significantly (p < 0.0001). Both daytime and nighttime micturition frequencies as well as the score levels of urgency and pain declined significantly during the course of treatment. The functional bladder capacity as indicated by the volume of first morning voiding increased from 157.9 ml +/- 7.5 to 186.7 ml +/- 6.9 (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). The level of urgency decreased from 6.8 +/- 0.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE; numerical rating scale (11-point box scale); p < 0.0001) and nocturia decreased from 4.0 +/- 0.2 to 2.1 +/- 0.1 times (mean +/- SE; p < 0.0001). Chondroitin sulphate instillation was effective and well tolerated in the therapy of chronic forms of cystitis associated with a possible GAG layer deficit (GAG layer: mainly composed of the glycosaminoglycans chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and heparan sulphate), but the results need to be confirmed in a controlled study. © ECV .

In a randomized study, doxepin mouthwash was shown to reduce oral mucositis-related pain. A common mouthwash comprising diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid is also widely used., Objective: To evaluate the effect of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash for the treatment of oral mucositis-related pain., Design, Setting, and Participants: A phase 3 randomized trial was conducted from November 1, 2014, to May 16, 2016, at 30 US institutions and included 275 patients who underwent definitive head and neck radiotherapy, had an oral mucositis pain score of 4 points or greater (scale, 0-10), and were followed up for a maximum of 28 days., Interventions: Ninety-two patients were randomized to doxepin mouthwash (25 mg/5 mL water); 91 patients to diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid; and 92 patients to placebo., Main Outcome and Measures: The primary end point was total oral mucositis pain reduction (defined by the area under the curve and adjusted for baseline pain score) during the 4 hours after a single dose of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash compared with a single dose of placebo. The minimal clinically important difference was a 3.5-point change. The secondary end points included drowsiness, unpleasant taste, and stinging or burning. All scales ranged from 0 (best) to 10 (worst)., Results: Among the 275 patients randomized (median age, 61 years; 58 [21%] women), 227 (83%) completed treatment per protocol. Mucositis pain during the first 4 hours decreased by 11.6 points in the doxepin mouthwash group, by 11.7 points in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group, and by 8.7 points in the placebo group. The between-group difference was 2.9 points (95% CI, 0.2-6.0; P = .02) for doxepin mouthwash vs placebo and 3.0 points (95% CI, 0.1-5.9; P = .004) for diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo. More drowsiness was reported with doxepin mouthwash vs placebo (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-4.0]; P = .03), unpleasant taste (by 1.5 points [95% CI, 0-3.0]; P = .002), and stinging or burning (by 4.0 points [95% CI, 2.5-5.0]; P < .001). Maximum grade 3 adverse events for the doxepin mouthwash occurred in 3 patients (4%); diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash, 3 (4%); and placebo, 2 (2%). Fatigue was reported by 5 patients (6%) in the doxepin mouthwash group and no patients in the diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash group., Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, the use of doxepin mouthwash or diphenhydramine-lidocaine-antacid mouthwash vs placebo significantly reduced oral mucositis pain during the first 4 hours after administration; however, the effect size was less than the minimal clinically important difference.

The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy improves overall survival for metastatic disease. We initiated a phase 2 trial to evaluate preoperative capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab with radiation therapy followed by surgery and postoperative 5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) and bevacizumab for locally advanced rectal cancer. METHOD(S): Fifty-seven patients with resectable T3/T4 rectal adenocarcinoma were enrolled. Preoperative treatment was capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice daily from Monday to Friday), oxaliplatin (50 mg/m2 weekly), bevacizumab (5 mg/kg on days 1, 15, 29), and radiation therapy (50.4 Gy). Surgery was performed by 6 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy. Beginning 8 to 12 weeks after surgery, patients received FOLFOX plus bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for 12 cycles. RESULT(S): Fifty-four of 57 enrolled patients were eligible. Forty-nine (91%) patients completed preoperative therapy and underwent surgery. Nine patients (17%; 90% confidence interval, 9%-27%) achieved pathologic complete response. Thirty-two patients (59%) experienced pathologic tumor downstaging, and 53% and 15% of patients experienced worst grade 3 and grade 4 acute toxicity, respectively. Forty-seven percent of patients who underwent surgery experienced a surgical complication. CONCLUSION(S): The primary endpoint of a 30% pathologic complete response rate was not reached; however, the majority of patients experienced pathologic downstaging with this regimen. Increased wound-healing delays and complications may have been related to the addition of bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, or both. Continued observation of these patients will establish the long-term morbidity and efficacy of this combined modality approach. © 2012 American Cancer Society.",Excluded
4544,"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for tumor staging and definition of tumor volumes on radiation treatment planning in nonsmall cell lung cancer A prospective radiographic cohort study of single center clinical outcome We investigate the impact of magnetic resonance (MR) on the staging and radiotherapy planning for patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 24 patients with NSCLC underwent MRI, which was fused with radiotherapy planning CT using rigid registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated not only according to CT image alone (GTVCT), but also based on both CT and MR image (GTVCT/MR). For each patient, 2 conformal treatment plans were made according to GTVCT and GTVCT/MR, respectively. Dose-volume histograms (DVH) for lesion and normal organs were generated using both GTVCT and GTVCT/MR treatment plans. All patients were irradiated according to GTVCT/MR plan. Median volume of the GTVCT/MR and GTVCT were 105.42cm3 and 124.45cm3, respectively, and the mean value of GTVCT/MR was significantly smaller than that of GTVCT (145.71+/-145.04 vs 174.30+/-150.34, P<0.01). Clinical stage was modified in 9 patients (37.5%). The objective response rate (ORR) was 83.3% and the l-year overall survival (OS) was 87.5%. MR is a useful tool in radiotherapy treatment planning for NSCLC, which improves the definition of tumor volume, reduces organs at risk dose and does not increase the local recurrence rate.Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

4367,"Systematic evaluation of salivary gland damage following I-131 therapy in differentiated thyroid cancer patients by quantitative scintigraphy and clinical follow-up Objectives Radioiodine therapy is a common adjunct to thyroidectomy in papillary thyroid cancer treatment. However, a variety of associated adverse effects have been reported. In this study, we assessed radioiodine-induced salivary gland dysfunction using quantitative scintigraphy, and evaluated the associated complications. Methods Patients were divided into five groups on the basis of the cumulative I-131 dosage received. Scintigraphic dynamic images of the salivary glands were obtained and converted into clinically relevant parameters: uptake index (UI), maximum secretion rate (%SR), and combined gland function scores. Patients were followed up for 3-66 months and interviewed for side effects including xerostomia, taste alteration, bitter taste, dental caries, xerophthalmia, and pain/swelling. Results An increase in I-131 doses resulted in a reduction in the UI and %SR and an increase in the combined scintigraphy score. Parotid glands were more affected than submandibular glands. A cumulative dosage of greater than 600 mCi resulted in complete loss of %SR in the parotid glands. No significant difference in either the UI or the %SR was observed between nontreated patients and patients receiving an I-131 dosage of up to 150 mCi. The occurrence of xerostomia was significantly correlated with the gland scintigraphic score, the number of treatment cycles, and I-131 dosage. The occurrence of pain and swelling was extremely low and only lasted for a short time. Conclusion Although the side effects associated with radioiodine treatment were apparent, they were usually small and temporary. Nevertheless, more consideration should be placed on careful dosing of I-131.Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

Of these, there were 21 persons exposed to ionizing radiation due to the Chemobyl accident with radiation-associated AML and 35 patients with spontaneous leukemia. The aim of this study was to determine if transport proteins (P-glycoprotein, LRP, and MDR1), apoptosis-related proteins (Fas, Bcl-2, Bax, p53, and Bcl-X(L)), and topoisomerase IIalpha expression in AML patients with the history of radiation exposure differed from those in spontaneous AML cases. Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated diseases compared to spontaneous AML more often overexpressed antiapoptotic oncoprotein Bcl-2 (12/21 vs. 6/35, p < 0.005) and less often demonstrated expression of Fas receptor (12/21 vs. 30/35, p < 0.05). Moreover, leukemic cells were simultaneously Fas negative and Bcl-2 positive in 4 out of 21 patients exposed to ionizing radiation but none of spontaneous cases had similar phenotype (p < 0.05). Leukemic cells in patients with radiation-associated AML compared to spontaneous cases more often were P-glycoprotein positive (12/20 vs 9/31, p < 0.05). P-glycoprotein overexpression significantly correlated with resistant disease in patients with radiation-associated AML (r = 0.47, p < 0.05), but was not a prognostic variable for the treatment outcome in terms of overall survival.

The immunogenicity of irradiated blood parasites for intact cattle and splenectomised calves Intraerythrocytic forms of B. bovis were exposed to 350 Grays (Gy) gamma irradiation and were then injected intravenously into intact two and three year old Hereford steers. One of 15 steers died on initial infection and subsequently six steers were given a virulent heterologous challenge three weeks after recovery; all six animals were highly immune. The remaining eight animals were kept under quarantine conditions for 10 months and were then challenged with a different virulent heterologous strain of B. bovis. Seven of eight were highly immune, but one animal died. Subsequently a further 12 steers were injected intravenously with 1 X 10(8) irradiated organisms. All showed only mild transient clinical signs. After 12 months quarantine in a tick-free area these animals were then challenged with a virulent heterologous strain and all 12 were shown to be highly immune. Irradiation reduced the infective dose from 1 X 10(8) to 2.5 X 10(3) parasites. These parasites multiplied at the same rate, and achieved the same maximum parasitaemia as the parent non-irradiated strain, but the disease produced by them was not severe.

However, organ motion during treatment is a challenging issue for this kind of technique. We develop a control system via Bluetooth technology to simulate and correct body motion during SABR. Method(s): Radiation doses were analyzed, and the radiation damage protection capability was checked by external beam therapy 3 (EBT3) films irradiated by a linear accelerator. A wireless signal test was also performed. A validation was performed with 8 previously treated patient respiratory pattern records and 8 healthy volunteers. Result(s): The homemade simulation system consisted of 2 linear actuators, one movable stage with a maximal moving distance of 6.5 cm x 12.5 cm x 5 cm to simulate the respiratory pattern of 8 patients precisely with a median error of 0.36 mm and a maximal motion difference of 1.17 mm, and 3.17 and chipset transited signals to display them as a waveform. From the test with 8 volunteers, the chip could detect deep respiratory movement up to 3 cm. The effect of the chip on a radiation dose of 400 monitor units (MUs) by 6 MV photons and 200 MUs by 10 MV photons showed high penetration rates of 98.8% and 98.6%, respectively. Conclusion(s): We invented a tubeless and wireless respiratory gating detection chip.

4320,"Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in laboratory mice experimentally enclosed in the radioactive Chernobyl environment Mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy using the protein-coding cytochrome b (Mtcyb) gene was assessed in laboratory mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c) exposed to the Chernobyl environment. Subacute to subchronic (30-40 days) exposure resulted in a cumulative radiation dose of 1.2-1.6 Gy ( approximately 0.04 Gy/day). Mice were sampled prior to introduction into the enclosures and again after removal from the enclosures. Nucleotide variation (site heteroplasmy) in 306 pre-exposure Mtcyb gene copies (122400 base pairs) was compared to variation in 354 postexposure gene copies (141600 base pairs). Five mutant copies, each characterized by a single nucleotide substitution, were observed (four in the pre-exposure samples, one in a postexposure sample). The frequencies of mutant gene copies and nucleotide substitutions in pre-exposure and postexposure samples were not significantly different. This suggests that this type of exposure (i.e. low dose rate) does not pose a significant mutation risk to the Mtcyb gene in digit tissue. Furthermore, no significant radiation risk to analogous human tissues may exist when occupational exposures involve low dose rates such as these. Finally, linear, cumulative models of genetic risk currently used to estimate radiation-induced effects are likely to be inappropriate for low-dose-rate exposures and need to be re-evaluated critically.",Included
4365,"An optimized test bolus for computed tomography pulmonary angiography and its application at 80kV with 10ml contrast agent Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is usually used for pulmonary embolism (PE) detection. However, the determination of scan timing remains a challenge due to the short scan duration of CTPA. We aimed to develop an optimized test bolus to determine scan delay in CTPA. The time-enhancement curves were obtained by measuring the enhancement within a region of interest in the main pulmonary artery and vein. A total of 70 patients were randomly divided into two groups (n=35 each): the control group underwent CTPA using the test bolus approach and the test group underwent CTPA using the biphasic time-enhancement curves approach. Tube voltages of 100 kVp and 80 kVp and 20ml and 10ml contrast agent were adopted in the control and test groups, respectively. The CT numbers, image quality, PE detection was evaluated. There was a point of intersection between the pulmonary artery and vein test bolus enhancement curves. The scan delay time (TDELAY) was obtained based on the time at intersection (TCROSS) and the scan duration (TSD): TDELAY=TCROSS - TSD. The mean CT numbers for pulmonary vein in the control were higher than those in the test group (all p<0.001). The image quality for the pulmonary arteries in the test group was better than that in the control group (p<0.01), with artifact reduction in the superior vena cava. Segmental PE could be detected using the optimized protocol. The radiation dose and iodine load in the test group were all lower than those in the control (p<0.01).

A total of 71 patients (41 males and 30 females) were involved in this study from June 2016 to June 2018, and they were divided into a template group (39 patients) and a conventional group (32 patients). The CT-based 3D reconstruction models were analyzed in the template group. From the perspective of the 3D atlas in a coronal view, the pedicle corridor was obtained. Taking the center of the tangential circle of the pedicle as the entry point, we simulated screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane. Then, the individual navigation template was designed and used in surgery. In the conventional group, free-hand pedicle screw placement was performed perpendicular to the coronal plane. The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and screw length of the pedicle corridor were measured in the template group. The surgical time, radiation exposure time, screw grading criteria and so on were evaluated and compared between the two groups after surgery., RESULTS: ;The diameter of the maximum tangential circle and the distance between the entry point and posterior tubercle were significantly greater in males than in females. The operation was successfully completed in all patients, without aggravation of nerve injury, and the follow-up was 12-20 months, with an average of 15.6 months. A total of 78 screws were inserted in the template group, and 64 screws were inserted in the conventional group. The surgical times in the template group and conventional group were 76.47+/-24.44 min and 125.63+/-36.41 min, respectively. The radiation exposure times in the template group and conventional group were 3.51+/-1.77 and 10.15+/-4.95, respectively, and there was a significant difference between the two groups. In the template group, the deviation in the screw entry point and screw angle were 1.92+/-1.67 mm and 2.08+/-1.98degree, respectively. The medial angle deviation between the left and right sides was 2.71+/-1.88degree in the template group, which was significantly less than the deviation of 3.76+/-2.22degree in the conventional group., CONCLUSION: A pedicle screw trajectory perpendicular to the coronal plane can be quickly obtained based on the perspective of 3D models. The technique of screw placement perpendicular to the coronal plane assisted by navigation templates has a shorter operative time, lessintraoperative fluoroscopy and a higher safety of screw placement than traditional surgery.",Excluded
3887,"Chromatic organization of ganglion cell receptive fields in the peripheral retina This study addresses the chromatic properties of receptive fields in the subcortical visual pathway of primates. There is agreement that, in the central visual field, many cells belonging to the parvocellular (PC) division of the subcortical pathway show red-green opponent responses, that a subgroup of cells belonging to the koniocellular (KC) pathway shows blue-yellow opponent responses, and that magnocellular (MC) pathway cells show only weak signs of chromatic input. However, the chromatic properties of ganglion cells in the peripheral retina are poorly understood. Here, we measured the temporal-chromatic properties of ganglion cells in extracellular in vivo recordings from peripheral macaque retina. We show that the chromatic responsivity of peripheral KC (""blue-on"") and MC cells is very similar to that of their counterparts in the foveal retina. Cone-opponent responses are expressed only at low temporal frequencies (<10 Hz) in the majority of peripheral PC cells, and some peripheral PC cells show non-opponent response properties. With these exceptions, the chromatic properties of ganglion cells are essentially preserved throughout the first 50 degrees of visual eccentricity. The main change seen in passing from foveal to peripheral retina is that all ganglion cell classes become more responsive to high temporal-frequency modulation.",Excluded

Hormonal suppression treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues has restored spermatogenesis in irradiated rats, but similar attempts were unsuccessful in irradiated mice, monkeys, and humans. In this study, we tested a stronger hormonal suppression regimen (the GnRH antagonist, acyline, and plus flutamide) for efficacy both in restoring endogenous spermatogenesis and in enhancing colonization of transplanted stem spermatogonia in mouse testes irradiated with a total doses between 10.5 and 13.5 Gy. A 4-week hormonal suppression treatment, given immediately after irradiation, increased endogenous spermatogenic recovery 1.5-fold, and 11-week hormonal suppression produced twofold increases compared with sham-treated irradiated controls. Furthermore, 10-week hormonal suppression restored fertility from endogenous surviving spermatogonial stem cells in 90% of 10.5-Gy irradiated mice, whereas only 10% were fertile without hormonal suppression. Four-and 11-week hormonal suppression also enhanced spermatogenic development from transplanted stem spermatogonia in irradiated recipient mice, by 3.1-and 4.8-fold, respectively, compared with those not given hormonal treatment. Moreover, the 10-week hormonal suppression regimen, but not a sham treatment, restored fertility of some 13.5-Gy irradiated recipient mice from donor-derived spermatogonial stem cells. This is the first report of hormonal suppression inducing recovery of endogenous spermatogenesis and fertility in a mouse model treated with anticancer agents. The combination of spermatogonial transplantation with hormonal suppression should be investigated as a treatment to restore fertility in young men after cytotoxic cancer therapy. © The Author 2010.

Three patients were treated with EBRT, 6 eyes with intravitreal methotrexate (median, 9.5; range, 2-15), and 2 eyes with intravitreal rituximab injections (median, 4; range, 2-6). Two patients developed marked keratitis because of methotrexate toxicity. At median follow-up of 33.5 months (range, 4-96), VRL had resolved in 7 eyes and persistent in 5 eyes. One patient died because of advanced CNS-NHL. Conclusion(s): Intravitreal chemotherapy provided good control rates for VRL patients in our limited series. Patients with associated CNS-NHL had poorer outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3989,"[Progressive mental deterioration after radiotherapy in adult patients with brain tumors] We report a study on changes of mental function in twenty five adult patients with cerebral low-grade gliomas after radiotherapy. None of them had shown mental deterioration before radiotherapy nor tumor recurrence after radiotherapy. Radiation was given at a dose of 48 to 78 Gy (mean: 54.2 Gy). Patients were assigned for mental functional levels according to Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) after radiotherapy. Ten patients (40%) were normal. Seven patients (28%) showed moderate disabilities and 8 (32%) severe disabilities. The median interval time from radiotherapy to the onset of mental deterioration was 2.5 years in the moderate group and 1.6 years in the severe group. CT findings in severe group demonstrated severe brain atrophy and diffuse low density in the white matter after radiotherapy. The risk factors responsible for progressive mental deterioration after radiotherapy may be radiation site and size (whole frontal lobe), total dose (over 60 Gy) and patients age at the time of radiotherapy (over 60 yrs).",Excluded
3816,"Seroprevalence and its impact on radiographic damage in korean rheumatoid arthritis patients starting biologics Background/Purpose: High titers of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACCP) are poor prognostic factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Only few studies have investigated the detailed clinical subtypes or radiographic changes based on serologic status; double (RF/ACCP) positive (+ve), RF or ACCP +ve, double negative (-ve) (seronegative, SN). We aimed to analyze the clinical and radiographic features of RA patients with robust disease activity, based on their serologic status. Method(s): RA patients registered in the Korean College of Rheumatology Biologics Registry (KOBIO), a nationwide inception cohort, were analyzed. Data regarding patient demographics, comorbidity, disease activity, medication, imaging and laboratory exams were utilized. After adjusting for gender, age, disease duration, and smoking history, we analyzed the association of seropositivity and bony erosion (hands and feet X-ray), and the association of the ACCP titer and joint damage, both at baseline (initiation of biologics) presented as odd ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval [95% CI]. Result(s): Data of 1198 RA patients were investigated. Mean age was 57.2 years, and disease duration was 8.3 +/- 7.6 years. Mean DAS28-ESR was 5.71, and erosion were found in 40.1% of patients. Being ACCP+ve was significantly associated with bony erosions (OR 1.69 [95% CI 1.13-2.52], p= 0.0096), compared with RF+ve (OR 1.03 p= 0.83), or RF+ve/ACCP+ve (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.19-4.01], p= 0.012). Of note, being ACCP+ve/RF-ve was strongly associated with radiographic damage (OR 4.93 [95% CI 2.29-10.61], p< 0.0001) in our analysis (figure). In contrast, a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ACCP titers were not positively associated with joint damage; a multivariate linear regression model revealed disease duration (estimate -3.95, p< 0.0001) and RF titer (estimate +0.0665, p= 0.0157) were associated with ACCP titers. Conclusion(s): Our data demonstrate the significance of ACCP in predicting radiographic damage in established Korean RA patients with persistently high disease activity. Longitudinal studies would be needed to clarify the impact of ACCP titers on radiographic progression. (Figure Presented).",Excluded
4378,"Ultraviolet B enhances DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity Background: CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recent studies showed that ultraviolet B (UVB, 290-320. nm) might induce the exacerbation of SLE by decreasing the DNA methylation level. However, the role of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in the UVB-induced CD4+ T cells DNA hypomethylation remains unclear. Objective(s): To elucidate the role of DNMT1 in lupus CD4+ T cells global DNA hypomethylation enhanced by UVB. Method(s): 35 SLE patients and 15 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. CD4+ T cells from SLE patients and healthy controls exposed to different dosages of UVB were analyzed. The global DNA methylation measurement, real-time PCR, Western blotting and DNMT1 catalytic activity detection were employed. Result(s): The level of global DNA methylation and DNMT1 mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients were significantly lower than those from the control group. DNA methylation was decreased after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner in SLE patients, but not in the control group. DNMT1 mRNA and protein expression level were not affected by UVB exposure in both SLE patients and healthy controls. DNMT1 catalytic activity was significantly decreased in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients after UVB exposure in a dosage-dependent manner. DNMT1 catalytic activity was lower and more sensitive to UVB exposure in CD4+ T cells from active SLE patients that from stable ones. Conclusion(s): UVB enhanced DNA hypomethylation of CD4+ T cells in SLE via inhibiting DNMT1 catalytic activity in a dosage-dependent manner. © 2013 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.",Excluded

This study was also designed to describe the clinical characteristics, treatment, and outcome of MCS to provide a better understanding of its clinical management. Method(s): A total of 27 patients with MCS were treated in Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China from October 1997 to March 2011. Demographic information and follow-up data were obtained and statistically analyzed. Result(s): Among the 27 patients, 9 were males and 18 were females with a mean age of 30.4 years (ranging from 14 years to 51 years). The median follow-up time was 42.6 months (ranging from 6 months to 104 months). Among the total number of tumor cases, 22 and 5 were detected in bone tissues and extra-skeletal sites, respectively. A total of 25 patients underwent surgery, but only 17 achieved the standard surgical margin of wide excision. Among these patients, 16 and 13 were subjected to chemotherapy and irradiation. The threeand five-year survival rates were 65% and 49.5%, respectively. Conclusion(s): MCS is a rare tumor resulting in morbidity with local recurrences and long-term metastases. In this study, standard multimodal regimens were proposed to treat MCS. The results recommended wide resection with suitable surgical margins as the preferred treatment. However, further studies should be conducted because the information about the benefits of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the control of local or systemic symptoms of MCS remains insufficient.",Excluded
3803,"Dosimetric comparison of lateral opposing fields in moderate-to-severe active TAO retro-orbital irradiation Background: To evaluate and compare the dosimetric advantages of lateral opposing fields (LOF) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in moderate-to-severe active thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) retroorbital irradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty-eight TAO patients who underwent radiotherapy from 2012 to 2018 were chosen. LOF and IMRT plans were separately developed for each patient. The independent samples t-test was used to compare the differences among conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), dose received by the maximal 95% of the target (D95), and organs-at-risk (OAR) doses between the two groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyze the relationship between exophthalmos and OAR dose. Result(s): CI and HI in the IMRT group were better than those in the LOF group, but crystal, eyeball, and optic nerve dose were higher than those in the LOF group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in D95 (P=0.261). In the LOF group, exophthalmos was negatively correlated with crystal and eyeball dose (P= 0.000). However, there was no correlation between these indicators in the IMRT group (P>0.05). In the LOF group, the median observation time was 26 months; the CT value of post-ball adipose tissue, exophthalmos, and clinical activity score was lower than those before treatment (P=0.000), and eyesight was better than that before treatment (P=0.000); 10% (2/20) had dry eyes and 5% (1/20) had decreased vision. Conclusion(s): LOF is safer than IMRT and can make full use of the high exophthalmos of TAO patients to reduce OAR dose.Copyright © 2021 Novin Medical Radiation Institute.

4175,"Mayak worker dosimetry study: an overview The Mayak Production Association (MPA) was the first plutonium production plant in the former Soviet Union. Workers at the MPA were exposed to relatively large internal radiation intakes and external radiation exposures, particularly in the early years of plant operations. This paper describes the updated dosimetry database, ""Doses-2005."" Doses-2005 represents a significant improvement in the determination of absorbed organ dose from external radiation and plutonium intake for the original cohort of 18,831 Mayak workers. The methods of dose reconstruction of absorbed organ doses from external radiation uses: 1) archive records of measured dose and worker exposure history, 2) measured energy and directional response characteristics of historical Mayak film dosimeters, and 3) calculated dose conversion factors for Mayak Study-defined exposure scenarios using Monte Carlo techniques. The methods of dose reconstruction for plutonium intake uses two revised models developed from empirical data derived from bioassay and autopsy cases and/or updates from prevailing or emerging International Commission on Radiological Protection models. Other sources of potential significant exposure to workers such as medical diagnostic x-rays, ambient onsite external radiation, neutron radiation, intake of airborne effluent, and intake of nuclides other than plutonium were evaluated to determine their impact on the dose estimates.",Excluded

Limited data are available regarding long-term vision-targeted health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of adult retinoblastoma survivors. OBJECTIVE To examine vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire for overall and specific scale scores among adult survivors of retinoblastoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Retinoblastoma Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort of adult retinoblastoma survivors treated at 3 academic medical centers in New York between 1932 and 1994. Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire between April 2008 and June 2010. Items were scored in January 2013 and preliminary analyses were performed in July 2015. Models were finalized in May 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported vision-targeted HRQoL as reported on the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Field Questionnaire. Items are scored from 0 to 100, with 100 representing the highest quality of life. RESULTS Among 470 adult retinoblastoma survivors (53.6% with bilateral disease; 52.1% female; 86.4% white and non-Hispanic; mean age at study, 43.3 years; range, 18.0-77.0 years), 86% had at least 1 eye removed (1 eye, 74.5%; both eyes, 11.5%); 56.5% were previously treated with radiotherapy; and 61.3% rated their eyesight as excellent/good while 16.2% reported complete blindness. The overall mean (SD) VFQ composite score for all survivors was 81.1 (17.2) (mean [SD] score for unilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 91.4 [7.7]; bilateral retinoblastoma survivors, 72.3 [18.2]; difference between survivors with unilateral and bilateral disease, 19.1 [95% CI, 16.5-21.7; P < .001]). Prior exposure to radiotherapy was not associated with decreased overall VFQ (s = -0.08; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.002; P = .06) but was related to a few specific subdomains of visual functioning.

4104,"What are the clinical and technical factors that influence the kerma-area product in percutaneous coronary intervention? The purpose of the paper is to define predictors of the kerma-area product (KAP) in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Two new digital X-ray interventional cardiology systems recently installed were included. A total of 398 PCI procedures were carried out by 6 board-certified senior interventional cardiologists with more than 15 years' experience and good knowledge of radiation protection measures. Clinical, radiation and procedural data were collected based on a detailed protocol developed by the SENTINEL cardiology subgroup. Correlation with clinical and procedure factors was then investigated. A significant correlation was found between fluoroscopy time and (i) lesion classification, (ii) the level of tortuosity and (iii) the number of vessels treated. No statistically significant differences were observed in the complexity of the case between operators. However, large differences were found in the KAP among operators, which were mostly attributed to the different number of frames taken by each operator. There was no statistically significant correlation between complexity and the total number of frames. The study showed that, in certain circumstances, the clinical need to successfully perform PCI takes precedence over radiation safety concerns.",Excluded
3954,"The Use of Public Health Indicators to Assess Individual Happiness in Post-Disaster Recovery PURPOSE: Very few studies have examined the influential factors of survivors' feelings of happiness in the context of nuclear accidents. This paper aims to fill this gap with reference to the recovery process in Fukushima City following the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami in Japan., METHODS: Open access data were sourced from the 2015 Social Survey on Living and Disaster Recovery (SSLDR) (N = 1439) of Fukushima citizens. Pearson's Chi-square Test and the t-test were employed to examine gender differences with regard to happiness and exploratory variables. Following this, a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the determinants of happiness., RESULTS: The results showed that, compared to females, male respondents were unhappier and reported more property loss and less neighborhood connectedness. Individuals' mental and physical health and neighborhood connectedness were found to be significantly correlated with their happiness. However, the disaster-related variables of people's evaluation of recovery achievement, concerns around the health impacts of radiation, property loss in the disaster, and experiences of casualty, had no effects on happiness., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that policies and countermeasures dealing with disaster recovery over the long term should continuously focus on health issues and social relationships.",Excluded

Methods Post-processing software was used to simulate C-arm angulations in two dimensions (oblique, cranial/caudal) for appropriate visualisation of distal landing zones at the iliac bifurcation during EVAR. Retrospectively, 27 consecutive EVAR patients (25 men, mean +/- SD age 73 +/- 7 years) were identified; one group of patients (NEW; n = 12 [23 iliac bifurcations]) was compared after implementation of the new method with a group of patients who received a historic method (OLD; n = 15 [23 iliac bifurcations]), treated with EVAR before the method was applied. Results In the OLD group, a median of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 1-3) digital subtraction angiography runs were needed per iliac bifurcation versus 1.0 (IQR 1-1) runs in the NEW group (p = .007). The median dose area products per iliac bifurcation were 11951 mGy*cm2 (IQR 7308-16663 mGy*cm2) for the NEW, and 39394 mGy*cm2 (IQR 19066-53702 mGy*cm2) for the OLD group, respectively (p = .001). The median volume of contrast per iliac bifurcation was 13.0 mL (IQR: 13-13 mL) in the NEW and 26 mL (IQR 13-39 mL) in the OLD group (p = .007).

3936,"Importance of surveillance and success of salvage strategies after definitive chemoradiation in patients with esophageal cancer Purpose: Patients with esophageal carcinoma (EC) who are treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (bimodality therapy [BMT]) experience frequent relapses. In a large cohort, we assessed the timing, frequency, and types of relapses during an aggressive surveillance program and the value of the salvage strategies. Patients and Methods: Patients with EC (N = 276) who received BMT were analyzed. Patients who had surgery within 6 months of chemoradiotherapy were excluded to reduce bias. We focused on local relapse (LR) and distant metastases (DM) and the salvage treatment of patients with LR only. Standard statistical methods were applied. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 54.3 months (95% CI, 48.4 to 62.4). First relapses included LR only in 23.2% (n = 64), DM with or without LR in 43.5% (n = 120), and no relapses in 33.3% (n = 92) of patients. Final relapses included no relapses in 33.3%, LR only in 14.5%, DM only in 15.9%, and DM plus LR in 36.2% of patients. Ninety-one percent of LRs occurred within 2 years and 98% occurred within 3 years of BMT. Twenty-three (36%) of 64 patients with LR only underwent salvage surgery, and their median overall survival was 58.6 months (95% CI, 28.8 to not reached) compared with those patients with LR only who were unable to undergo surgery (9.5 months; 95% CI, 7.8 to 13.3). Conclusion(s): Unlike in patients undergoing trimodality therapy, for whom surveillance/salvage treatment plays a lesser role,1 in the BMT population, approximately 8% of all patients (or 36% of patients with LR only) with LRs occurring more than 6 months after chemoradiotherapy can undergo salvage treatment, and their survival is excellent. Our data support vigilant surveillance, at least in the first 24 months after chemotherapy, in these patients.Copyright © 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3771,"Radiographic Union Scoring Scale for Determining Consolidation Rates in the Calcaneus The reliable evaluation of osseous consolidation after hindfoot osteotomy can be difficult. Concomitant hindfoot osteotomies often dictate the advancement of weightbearing, and radiographs are the mainstay imaging tool owing to cost, efficiency, and radiation exposure. Understanding the radiographic parameters that can be used to reliably determine osseous healing is paramount. However, currently, no reliable or validated method is available to determine osseous healing of hindfoot osteotomies in irregular bones of the foot. The purpose of the present study was to develop a radiographic healing scoring system that would enhance the diagnostic healing assessment after elective calcaneal osteotomy. We adapted existing orthopedic scales validated for healing in the leg for application in the irregular bones of the foot. A total of 168 cases were evaluated by 6 blinded assessors to test the interrater reliability of subjective healing assessment compared with the proposed scoring system. The radiographs were classified by postoperative period: <=4 weeks, 5 to 12 weeks, and >12 weeks. The proposed scale had high interrater reliability but was burdensome. Using a priori item reduction protocols, a limited 6-item scale further improved internal consistency and reduced the burden. The result was excellent interrater reliability (alpha = 0.98, standard deviation 0.02, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 0.96) among all assessors when using the scoring scale compared with unacceptable reliability (alpha = 0.438) for subjective osteotomy healing. The reliability of our system appeared superior to that of subjective assessment of osseous healing alone, even in the absence of clinical correlates after osteotomy of the calcaneus.

Feature selection was based on the prognostic performance and feature stability in the training cohort. Radscores were generated using the Cox proportional hazards regression model with the selected features in the training cohort and then validated in the internal and external validation cohorts. We also constructed a nomogram for predicting local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Finding(s): Eleven features were selected to construct the Radscore, which was significantly associated with LRFS. For the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts, the Radscore (C-index: 0.741 vs. 0.753 vs. 0.730)outperformed clinical prognostic variables (C-index for primary gross tumor volume: 0.665 vs. 0.672 vs. 0.577; C-index for age: 0.571 vs. 0.629 vs. 0.605)in predicting LRFS. The generated radiomics nomogram, which integrated the Radscore and clinical variables, exhibited a satisfactory prediction performance (C-index: 0.810 vs. 0.807 vs. 0.753). The nomogram-defined high-risk group had a shorter LRFS than did the low-risk group (5-year LRFS: 73.6% vs. 95.3%, P <.001; 79.6% vs 95.8%, P =.006; 85.7% vs 96.7%, P =.005).

3548,"Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor cells produce large quantities of bioactive tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) after radiation exposure PURPOSE: In the present study, we examined human Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cell lines that are able to produce TNF-alpha as part of the response to irradiation. Radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may enhance irradiation efficacy and improve the effect of local tumor irradiation. On the other hand, radiation-induced tumor cell production of TNF-alpha may adversely affect the normal tissue., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twelve different ES/pPNET cell lines were investigated in vitro and (after establishment as tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice) in vivo for their TNF-alpha mRNA expression (real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and TNF-alpha protein production (in vitro: enhanced amplified sensitivity immunoassay; in vivo: immunohistochemistry) after exposure to different irradiation doses (2, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 40 Gy) and after different time intervals (1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, or 72 h after irradiation). The bioactivity of the TNF-alpha protein was evaluated in chromogenic cytotoxicity and neutralization assays., RESULTS: Nine out of 12 ES/pPNET cell lines express constitutively significant quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha in vitro. ES/pPNET cells originating from primary tumors secreted higher TNF-alpha levels than cells derived from metastatic lesions. In 5 of the 9 TNF-alpha-producing cell lines, TNF-alpha mRNA and protein levels were upregulated after irradiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. After establishment of the ES/pPNET cell lines in athymic nude mice, the radiation-induced TNF-alpha release could be demonstrated also in the xenograft tumors in vivo (analogous to the in vitro experiments). Using the same methods for quantitative analysis, it was determined that the TNF-alpha expression of the radiation-responsive tumor cells was up to 2000-fold higher compared to the maximal radiation-induced TNF-alpha release in normal lung tissue measured during the pneumonic phase., CONCLUSION: Certain ES/pPNET cell lines produce extremely large quantities of bioactive TNF-alpha after radiation exposure in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Radiation-induced TNF-alpha production of tumor cells may be of paramount importance in respect to not only tumor behavior, but also to potential damage to normal tissue and the clinical status of the host.",Included
3967,"Dentists' use of digital radiographic techniques: Part I - intraoral X-ray: a questionnaire study of Swedish dentists OBJECTIVE: The present study aims to gain knowledge about the dentist's use and choice of digital intraoral imaging methods., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A questionnaire sent to 2481 dentists within the Swedish Dental Society contained questions about the type of X-ray technique used, problems experienced with digital radiography, and reasons for choosing digital technology, and about indications, clinic size and type of service. Response rate was 53%., RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of the dentists had made the transition to digital radiography; only 2% used film technique, and solid-state detector (SSD) was the most used digital technique. More years in service decreases the likelihood of applying individual indications for performing a full mouth examination. More retakes were done with SSDs compared to storage phosphor plates. Reasons for choosing digital techniques were that work was easier and communication with the patients improved. However, dentists also experienced problems with digital techniques, such as exposure and projection errors and inadequate image quality. The Swedish Radiation Safety Authority states that all radiological examinations should be justified, something not always followed., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that 98% of the respondents, Swedish dentists within the Swedish Dental Society, used digital techniques, and the most used was the solid-state technique.",Excluded

These patients received a 75 mg/m2 (11 patients) or 40 mg/m2 (11 patients) dose of BsmAb and escalating activities of (131)I-di-DTPA-indium 5 d later. Toxicity and tumor response were assessed in 20 patients who received a therapeutic (>2.2 GBq) hapten dose of radioactivity., RESULTS: The percentage of lesions detected by immunoscintigraphy after injection of the therapeutic dose of hapten was 70% on an anatomic-site basis. High bone uptake was relatively frequent. A transient grade I or II hepatic toxicity was observed in 5 patients (45%) injected with 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb and in 1 patient (11%) injected with 40 mg/m2. No other nonhematologic toxicity was observed. With 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb, hematologic toxicity was high: 5 cases of grade III or IV leukopenia (45%) and 5 cases of grade III or IV thrombopenia (45%). With a 40 mg/m2 dose of BsmAb, hematologic toxicity was reduced significantly: 3 cases of grade III or IV leukopenia (33%) and 1 case of grade III or IV thrombopenia (11%) (P = 0.02). Toxicity was significantly higher in MTC patients than in non-MTC patients (P = 0.019). Nine cases of tumor stabilization of 3 mo to more than 12 mo were observed (45%), 6 in the MTC group and 3 in the non-MTC group. The rate of disease stabilization was significantly higher with 75 mg/m2 of BsmAb (64%) than with 40 mg/m2 (22%) (P = 0.04). Human antimouse antibody elevation was observed in 1 patient (8%) and human antihuman antibody in 4 (33%)., CONCLUSION: A BsmAb dose of 40 mg/m2 and a 5-d interval appeared to be a better dose/schedule regimen, with acceptable toxicity. Under these conditions, the maximal tolerated activity was 3 GBq of 131I-di-DTPA-indium in MTC patients. In non-MTC patients, dose escalation should continue.",Excluded
4479,"Eustachian tube dysfunction in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pre- and post-irradiation Eustachian tube function tests were performed in 34 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma before and after irradiation. Tubal dysfunction prior to irradiation in these patients was due to functional impairment. However, tubal dysfunction after irradiation was due to both organic obstruction and functional impairment. Organic obstruction of the tube was found to be severe with higher dosages of irradiation (to 80 Gy) resulting in subsequent otitis media. In our experience, higher doses of irradiation should be avoided if possible, but insertion of a ventilation tube should be done if a high dose of irradiation is planned.",Excluded
4317,"Frequency and etiology of ventilator-associated events in the medical intensive care unit Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed new criteria based on a significant deterioration in oxygenation to identify ventilator-associated events (conditions). The aim of this study was to determine how frequently this happened and what caused these conditions. Method(s): Electronic medical records and x-rays from 281 ventilator episodes in the medical intensive care unit were reviewed to determine the characteristics of patients requiring ventilation and the number of patients meeting the criteria for ventilatorassociated conditions (VACs). Result(s): This cohort included 257 patients (55.4% men) who required 281 episodes of mechanical ventilation. The mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Healthy Evaluation II score was 13.5 +/- 5.9. The initial mean PaO2/FiO2 was 210 +/- 110. The median number of ventilator days was 4 (interquartile range: 3-9). The overall mortality was 32.3%. Nineteen patients (11.7% of eligible episodes) met the CDC criteria for a VAC; 6 met FiO2 criteria (31.6%) and 13 met positive end expiratory pressure criteria (68.4%). Twelve patients (63.2%) had an increased white blood cell count (>12k/muL) during the event. Eleven patients had an increase in temperature (.38degreeC) during this period. The etiology of these conditions included pneumonia (n = 4), atelectasis (n = 4), congestive heart failure (n = 5), acute respiratory distress syndrome (n = 2), and miscellaneous reasons (n = 4). Conclusion(s): VACs occurred in 11.7% of patients in our medical intensive care unit. The etiology of these events was diverse and did not usually reflect complications. These new CDC criteria for institutional reporting of complications during mechanical ventilation do not necessarily identify complications or provide a good method for comparing outcomes in hospitals.© Copyright by the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.",Excluded
3830,"Effects of (12)C(6+) ion radiation and ferulic acid on the zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryonic oxidative stress response and gene expression The effects of carbon ion irradiation and ferulic acid (FA) on the induction of oxidative stress and alteration of gene expression were studied in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos. Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1Gy, 3Gy and 7Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn-sod, Mn-sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.

Methods and Materials: Eligible patients were 18 to 80 years of age, had a Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score 70%, and newly diagnosed stage IV NSCLC with limited metastatic disease (defined as involving 3 organs). Patients received platinum-doublet chemotherapy with concurrent irradiation to the primary tumor. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and acute toxicity. Result(s): From May 2008 to May 2012, 198 eligible patients were enrolled from 7 cancer centers. Most patients died with distant metastasis; only 10% died with isolated primary recurrence. Median OS time was 13.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.7-14.3); OS rates were 53.5% at 1 year, 15.8% at 2 years, and 9.2% at 3 years. Median progression-free survival (PFS) time was 9.0 months (95% CI: 7.7-10.3); corresponding PFS rates were 30.8%, 8.2%, and 6.1%. The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year local (primary tumor) control rates were 78.8%, 57.7%, and 55.4%. Multivariate analysis showed that delivery of 63 Gy to the primary tumor (PZ.014), having a primary tumor volume <134 cm3 (PZ.008), and having a stable or higher KPS score after treatment (PZ.01) were independent predictors of better OS. The most common severe (grades 3-4) acute toxicities were hematologic: leukopenia (37.9%), thrombocytopenia (10.1%), and anemia (6.9%). No patients experienced grade 4 or 5 radiationrelated toxicity; 2.5% had acute grade 3 pneumonitis, and 6.6% had acute grade 3 radiation esophagitis. Conclusion(s): Thoracic 3D-RT to the primary tumor with concurrent chemotherapy led to satisfactory survival outcomes with acceptable toxicity. Radiation dose, primary tumor volume, and PFS after treatment all predicted survival in these patients with limited-metastasis NSCLC.Copyright © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4316,"Effects of irradiation on experimental autoallergic sialadenitis This study was designed to investigate the influence of localizedd irradiation (1000 R) on the time of development and intensity of an immunologically mediated inflammatory lesion. An experimental autoallergic sialadenitis (EAS) of the rat submandibular gland was developed to serve as the standard lesion. Consistently mild or severe lesions of EAS were induced in male Lewis rats when they were immunized with allogeneic submandibular glands from sexually immature or mature female donors, respectively. Neck irradiation alone 7-56 days prior to sacrifice induced only occasional inflammatory lesions in the submandibular glands. The weights of the submandibular glands were seen to decrease progressively while the body weights continued to rise. Neck irradiation 7-56 days prior to sacrifice of animals immunized 7-21 days prior to sacrifice to induce mild or severe EAS did not significantly accelerate development of the lesion nor w,as the intensity of inflammatory lesions significantly modified. In nanimals with mild or severe EAS which were neck irradiated, the weights of the submandibular glands were found to decrease while the body weight remained relatively unchanged.

4445,"Comparison of a safety strategy using transradial access and dual-axis rotational coronary angiography with transfemoral access and standard coronary angiography Objectives We sought to investigate the radiation exposure and contrast utilization associated with using a strategy of transradial access and rotational angiography (radial-DARCA) compared to the traditional approach of transfemoral access and standard angiography (femoral-SA). Background There is an increased focus on optimizing patient safety during cardiac catheterization procedures. Professional guidelines have highlighted physician responsibility to minimize radiation doses and contrast volume. Dual axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) is the most recently investigated type of rotational angiography. This new technique permits complete visualization of the left or right coronary tree with a single injection, and is felt to reduce contrast and radiation exposure. Methods A total of 56 consecutive patients who underwent radial-DARCA were identified. From the same time period, an age- and gender-matched group of 61 patients who had femoral-SA were selected for comparison. Total volume of contrast agent used, fluoroscopy time, and 2 measures of radiation dose (dose area product and air kerma) were recorded for each group. Results Mean contrast agent use and patient radiation exposure of the radial-DARCA group were significantly less than that of the femoral-SA group. There was no significant difference in fluoroscopy time between the 2 groups. Conclusions Physicians can successfully employ an innovative safety strategy of transradial access combined with DARCA that is feasible and is associated with lower radiation doses and contrast volume than femoral artery access and traditional coronary angiography approach. © 2013, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded

4030,"Normal Tissue Complication Probability Modeling of Pulmonary Toxicity After Stereotactic and Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Central Lung Tumors Purpose: To evaluate clinical pulmonary and radiographic bronchial toxicity after stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and hypofractionated radiation therapy for central lung tumors, and perform normal tissue complication probability modeling and multivariable analyses to identify predictors for toxicity. Methods and Materials: A pooled analysis was performed of patients with a central lung tumor treated using <=12 fractions at 2 centers between 2006 and 2015. Airways were manually contoured on planning computed tomography scans, and doses were recalculated to an equivalent dose of 2 Gy per fraction with an alpha/beta ratio of 3. Grade >=3 (>=G3) clinical pulmonary toxicity was evaluated by 2 or more physicians. Radiographic toxicity was defined as a stenosis or an occlusion with or without atelectasis using follow-up computed tomography scans. Logistic regression analyses were used for statistical analyses. Result(s): A total of 585 bronchial structures were studied in 195 patients who were mainly treated using 5 or 8 fractions (60%). Median patient survival was 27.9 months (95% confidence interval 22.3-33.6 months). Clinical >=G3 toxicity was observed in 24 patients (12%) and radiographic bronchial toxicity in 55 patients (28%), both mainly manifesting <=12 months after treatment. All analyzed dosimetric parameters correlated with clinical and lobar bronchial radiographic toxicity, with V130Gy,EQD having the highest odds ratio. Normal tissue complication probability modeling showed a volume dependency for the development of both clinical and radiographic toxicity. On multivariate analyses, significant predictors for >=G3 toxicity were a planning target volume overlapping the trachea or main stem bronchus (P =.005), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P =.034), and the total V130Gy,EQD (P =.012). Radiographic bronchial toxicity did not significantly correlate with clinical toxicity (P =.663). Conclusion(s): We identified patient and dosimetric factors associated with clinical and radiographic toxicity after high-dose radiation therapy for central lung tumors. Additional data from prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4197,"18F-Fluorothymidine radiation dosimetry in human PET imaging studies UNLABELLED: 3'-Deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) is a PET imaging agent that shows promise for studying cellular proliferation in human cancers. FLT is a nucleoside analog that enters cells and is phosphorylated by human thymidine kinase 1, but the 3' substitution prevents further incorporation into DNA. We estimated the radiation dosimetry for this tracer from data gathered in patient studies., METHODS: Time-dependent tissue concentrations of radioactivity were determined from blood samples and PET images of 18 patients after intravenous injection of (18)F-FLT. Radiation-absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRD Committee methods, taking into account variations that were based on the distribution of activities observed in the individual patients. Effective dose equivalent (EDE) was calculated using International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60 tissue weighting factors for the standard man and woman., RESULTS: For a single bladder voiding at 6 h after (18)F-FLT injection, the (18)F-FLT EDE (mean +/- SD) was 0.028 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (103 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard male patient and 0.033 +/- 0.012 mSv/MBq (121 +/- 43 mrem/mCi) for a standard female patient. The organ that received the highest dose was the bladder (male, 0.179 mGy/MBq [662 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.174 mGy/MBq [646 mrad/mCi]), followed by the liver (male, 0.045 mGy/MBq [167 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.064 mGy/MBq [238 mrad/mCi]), the kidneys (male, 0.035 mGy/MBq [131 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.042 mGy/MBq [155 mrad/mCi]), and the bone marrow (male, 0.024 mGy/MBq [89 mrad/mCi]; female, 0.033 mGy/MBq [122 mrad/mCi])., CONCLUSION: Organ dose estimates for (18)F-FLT are comparable to those associated with other commonly performed nuclear medicine tests, and the potential radiation risks associated with (18)F-FLT PET imaging are within accepted limits.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): We studied 30 patients (14 women and 16 men; mean age, 64.5 +/- 13.1 years; range, 39-90 years) with colorectal cancer referred for surgical treatment. All underwent CTC with fecal tagging under a standard 120-kVp protocol in the supine position and a 100-kVp protocol in the prone position. The 120-kVp images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP). The 100-kVp images were postprocessed using FBP and a hybrid type of IR (adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D). The effective radiation dose (ED), image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared among the three protocols. The visual image quality was scored on a four-point scale. Result(s): The mean ED was significantly lower under the 100-kVp protocol than the 120-kVp protocol, resulting in a 27% radiation dose decrease (3.5 +/- 2.0 vs 2.5 +/- 1.5 mSv; P <01). Image noise decreased by 48%, and the mean attenuation of tagged fluid increased from 452 to 558 HU on images acquired at 100 kVp with IR compared to that in the 120-kVp protocol; these differences were significant. The mean CNR was significantly higher under the 100 kVp with IR than the other two protocols. We found no significant differences in the visual scores for diagnostic utility between the 100 kVp with IR and the 120 kVp with FBP protocol (P=10). Conclusion(s): Low-tube-voltage CTC reduced the radiation dose by approximately 27% while maintaining the image quality.Copyright © 2016 AUR.",Excluded

A double-blinded randomised study of two protocols AIM: To evaluate the ultra-lose dose imaging protocol (ULDP), compared to the standard low-dose imaging protocol (LDP), which are used for haemodialysis access, in terms of radiation exposure and image quality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single-centre, institutional review board-approved, prospective, double-blinded randomised controlled study to compare radiation exposure and image quality of the ULDP and LDP. Ten proceduralists, two radiographers, and 11 nurses were enrolled. Radiation exposure during 80 procedures (40 angioplasties and 40 thrombolysis) was recorded (direct radiation to patients from protocol report and scattered radiation to participants from the RaySafe i2 real-time dosimetry system). Baseline characteristics of procedure were recorded. Image quality was assessed subjectively using questionnaires based on the five-point Likert scale after each procedure. RESULT(S): Compared with LDP, the use of ULDP was associated with a significantly lower rate of radiation exposure to proceduralists, patients, and scrub nurses (0.506+/-0.430 versus 0.847+/-0.965 muSv/s, p=0.044; 0.571+/-1.284 versus 1.284+/-1.007 mGy/s, p<0.001; and 0.052+/-0.071 versus 0.141+/-0.185 muSv/s, p=0.005, respectively). No significant difference in image quality or duration of procedure was observed (all p values >0.05).

4233,"The role of vitamin D in the carcinogenesis of breast and ovarian cancer The review evaluates the role of vitamin D in carcinogenesis. Based on ecological studies, the incidence of many cancers has been shown to be higher in northern countries, suggesting an association with latitude and solar radiation. Vitamin D produced in skinunder the influence of sun exposure may play a protective role in the process leading to cancer. Vitamin D deficiency is now recognized as a pandemic, mainly due to lack of knowledge that sun exposure in moderation is the major source of vitamin D for most human. After vitamin D was discovered to be the necessary element of nourishment to prevent rickets at the beginning of the twentieth century, the theory concerning its role has evolved. It is now recognized that vitamin D, and particularly its active form 1.25 (OH)2D, is an important hormone playing a crucial role in human homeostasis. 1.25(OH)2D3 has been shown to inhibit cancer cell growth, inducecancer cell maturation, induce apoptosis, and decrease angiogenesis. Several studies suggested that living at higher geographical latitudes increased the risk of developing and dying of colon, prostate, breast and other cancers. People exposed to sunlight were noted to less likely develop cancer. Several studies evaluated circulating levels of 25(OH)D and its possible association with cancer. Case-control studies and laboratory tests have consistently demonstrated that vitamin D plays an important role in the prevention ofbreast cancer. Vitamin D supplementation is a much needed, low cost, effective, and safe intervention strategy for breast cancer prevention that should be implemented. It has been shown that vitamin D levels are lower in ovarian cancer patients. Low 25(OH) D concentration associated with lower overall survival rate might suggest for the important role of severe deficiency in more aggressive course of ovarian cancer. Testing for 25(OH)D in the standard procedure could help to find ovarian cancer patients with worse prognosis, who would benefit from special attention and supplementation. Vitamin D3 supplementation in moderate doses achieving 25(OH)D concentrations of 30-80ng/ml, can be recommended as many benefits may be expected, including decreased risk of developing cancer.",Excluded
3892,"Comparison of 3D confromal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiotherapy with or without simultaneous integrated boost during concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancers Objective: Radiotherapy techniques have evolved from 3D conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) to intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) where boost fields are delivered either sequentially (IMRTseq) or with a simultaneous integrated boost (IMRT+SIB). Our goal was to compare the outcomes of patients treated with IMRT+SIB to traditional standards. Method(s): We analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT, IMRTseq or IMRT+SIB. Between 1993 and 2012, 379 patients with non-metastatic Stage III-IV head and neck squamous cell cancer were treated with concurrent chemoradiation using 3D-CRT (n = 125), IMRTseq (n = 120) and IMRT+SIB (n = 134). Result(s): Patients treated with any technique had similar rates of 2y local control, 2y regional control, 2y progression free survival and 2y overall survival. Patients treated with IMRT +SIB had lower rates acute toxicity according to Grade 3 or greater mucositis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 36.7% vs. IMRT+SIB: 22.4%; P<.0001), dermatitis (3D-CRT: 44.0% vs. IMRTseq: 20.0% vs. IMRT+SIB: 7.5%; P<.0001) and feeding tube placement during radiotherapy (3D-CRT: 80.0% vs. IMRTseq: 50.8% vs. IMRT+SIB: 44.0%; P<.0001) as well as late toxicity as measured by feeding tube use (P<.0001) and tracheostomy use (P<.0001). On multivariate analysis, IMRT+SIB predicted for less mucositis, dermatitis and feeding tube use compared to 3D-CRT and for less dermatitis compared to IMRTseq. Conclusion(s): Compared to 3D-CRT and IMRTseq, IMRT+SIB provided similar outcomes and potentially less toxicity indicating it is a feasible technique for chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer. © 2014 Spiotto, Weichselbaum.",Excluded

METHOD(S): We recruited consecutive eligible patients with >70% symptomatic carotid stenosis with a complete circle of Willis and normal vertebral arteries to the observational cohort study. We detected changes in the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to peak (TTP) and permeability surface area-product (PS) before and after carotid stenting. We have also compared the absolute differences in the ipsilateral and contralateral CT perfusion markers before and after stenting. The search for regression models of ""36 months after stenting"" results was based on a stepwise analysis with bidirectional elimination method. RESULT(S): A total of 34 patients completed the 36 months follow-up (15 females, mean age of 69.68+/-S.D. 7.61 years). At 36 months after stenting, the absolute values for CT perfusion markers had improved: CBF (ipsilateral: +7.76%, contralateral: +0.95%); CBV (ipsilateral: +5.13%, contralateral: +3.00%); MTT (ipsilateral: -12.90%; contralateral: -5.63%); TTP (ipsilateral: -2.10%, contralateral: -4.73%) and PS (ipsilateral: -35.21%, contralateral: -35.45%).

Another 60 patients considered as the control group underwent only an MRI preoperatively and a pathological examination postoperatively. For the patients in the study group, meningiomas were removed by a hand-held gamma-probe 4-12 h after SRS; these patients were followed up by MRI examination each year for 5 years to monitor the recurrence rate of the meningiomas. For the control group, routine operations without radio guidance were performed and followed up with MRI examination simultaneously., RESULTS: All patients in the study group, comprising 20 with grade I and 10 with grade II meningiomas, showed high Tc-HYNIC-octreotide accumulation with a sensitivity of 100% for SRS; four patients (13.3%) relapsed after a 5-year follow-up, including one (5%) patient with a grade I and three (30%) patients with a grade II meningioma. However, among the 60 control patients, 30 were of grade I and 30 were of grade II; 18 patients (30%) experienced recurrence, including five (16.7%) grade I patients and 13 (43.3%) grade II patients.

3495,"ATM and p53 combined analysis predicts survival in glioblastoma multiforme patients: A clinicopathologic study Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant cancers, with a distinguishing dismal prognosis: surgery followed by chemo- and radiotherapy represents the current standard of care, and chemo- and radioresistance underlie disease recurrence and short overall survival of patients suffering from this malignancy. ATM is a kinase activated by autophosphorylation upon DNA doublestrand breaks arising from errors during replication, byproducts of metabolism, chemotherapy or ionizing radiations; TP53 is one of the most popular tumor suppressor, with a preeminent role in DNA damage response and repair. To study the effects of the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM and p53 in glioblastoma patients, 21 cases were retrospectively examined. In normal brain tissue, p-ATM was expressed only in neurons; conversely, in tumors cells, the protein showed a variable cytoplasmic expression (score: +,++,+++), with being completely undetectable in three cases. Statistical analysis revealed that high p-ATM score (++/+++) strongly correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.022). No difference in overall survival was registered between p53 normally expressed (NE) and overexpressed (OE) glioblastoma patients (P = 0.669). Survival analysis performed on the results from combined assessment of the two proteins showed that patients with NE p53 /low pATM score had longer overall survival than the NE p53/ high pATM score counterpart. Cox-regression analysis confirmed this finding (HR = 0.025; CI 95% = 0.002-0.284; P = 0.003). Our study outlined the immunohistochemical expression of p-ATM/p53 in glioblastomas and provided data on their possible prognostic/predictive of response role. A ""non-oncogene addiction"" to ATM for NEp53 glioblastoma could be postulated, strengthening the rationale for development of ATM inhibiting drugs.Copyright © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4377,"A mice radiation-induced liver disease model for stereotactic body radiation therapy validated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): Lower radiation tolerance of the whole liver hinders dose escalations of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. This study was conducted to define the exact doses resulting in radiation-induced liver diseases (RILD) and dose constraints for the critical organs at risk (OARs) in mice, which are still undefined in HCC SBRT. Materials/Methods: This study was consisted of 2 phases. In the primary phase, mice treated with helical tomotherapy based SBRT were stratified according to escalating radiation doses to the livers. Pathological differences, signs, such as mouse performance status (MPS), and serum aspartate/ alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)/albumin levels were observed. Radiation-induced disease severities of OARs were scored using systematic evaluation standards. In the validation phase in human, 13 patients with HCC who had undergone radiation therapy before hepatectomy were enrolled to validate RILD pathological changes in mice study. Result(s): Evaluation criteria of mouse liver radiation therapy relating signs were as follows: MPS >=2.0+/-0.52, AST/ALT >=589.2+/-118.5/137.4+/-15.3 U/L, serum albumin <=16.8+/-2.29 g/L. Preliminary dose constraints of OARs had also been obtained, such as livers: average dose <=26.36+/-1.71 Gy and gastrointestinal tract: maximum dose <=22.63 Gy. Mouse RILD models could be developed when livers were irradiated with the average doses >=31.76+/-1.94 Gy (single fraction). RILD pathological changes in mice had also been validated in HCC patients. Conclusion(s): Mouse RILD models could be developed with SBRT based on the dose constraints for OARs and evaluation criteria of mice liver radiation therapy relating signs, which will favor the study of further approaches of treating HCC with SBRT.",Excluded
4125,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry Background: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk. Case Description: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy). Conclusion(s): We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
4582,"Vitamin K status in spaceflight and ground-based models of spaceflight Bone loss is a well-documented change during and after long-duration spaceflight. Many types of countermeasures to bone loss have been proposed, including vitamin K supplementation. The objective of this series of studies was to measure change in vitamin K status in response to microgravity under a variety of spaceflight and spaceflight analog (model) conditions, including long-duration spaceflight studies (n = 15), three bed rest studies (n = 15, 49, and 24), and a 14-day saturation dive (n = 6). In crew members who flew 2-6 months on the International Space Station, in-flight and postflight plasma phylloquinone concentrations were unchanged from the preflight mean. Consistent with this finding, urinary I-carboxyglutamic acid (GLA), a measure of vitamin K-dependent protein turnover, did not change in response to flight. Serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%ucOC), a measure of vitamin K function, was generally unchanged in response to flight. Spaceflight findings were corroborated by findings of no changes in phylloquinone, urinary GLA, or %ucOC during or after bed rest in three separate bed rest studies (21-90 days in duration) or after a 14-day saturation dive. The data presented here do not support either a need for vitamin K supplementation during spaceflight or the suggestion of using vitamin K as a bone loss countermeasure in spaceflight. © 2011 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",Excluded
3846,"Utility of postoperative radiographs after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior instrumentation STUDY DESIGN.: Retrospective clinical and radiographical review. OBJECTIVE.: To evaluate the utility of plain radiographical surveillance after anterior lumbar interbody fusion and determine to what extent radiographical findings affect postoperative decision making. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Postoperative radiographical surveillance is a ubiquitous practice among spine surgeons, which lacks evidence and has received growing attention in an environment of increasing health care cost and receding resources. Lumbar interbody fusions are being performed with increasing frequency from numerous approaches; nonetheless, there are no evidence-based guidelines for postoperative radiographical evaluation of patients after these procedures. METHODS.: One hundred forty-six consecutive patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without short segment posterior fusion from 2008 to 2011 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were less than 6 months of follow-up, prior surgery, hybrid constructs with disc arthroplasty, and concurrent posterior fusion of greater than 3 levels. Three hundred fifty-nine radiographical series and 330 clinic notes of the included 67 patients were reviewed. Radiographs were evaluated for abnormalities and clinic notes reviewed for any changes in clinical management by multiple reviewers. Interobserver reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS.: There was no single instance of a change in treatment course based on radiographical findings alone in any of the 330 clinic visits of the 67 included patients during an average 15.8-month postoperative follow-up period. Thirty-four of the 67 patients (51%) had some change in their management on the basis of their clinical symptoms and/or examination. Interobserver agreement for change in management was 0.96 (kappa = 0.918). Sensitivity (6%), specificity (97%), positive predictive value (67%), and negative predictive value (50%) were calculated. CONCLUSION.: Routine postoperative radiographical surveillance has minimal value for asymptomatic patients after anterior lumbar interbody fusion with or without posterior fusion. Obtaining a limited number of postoperative films of these patients in the absence of clinical symptoms or risk factors could significantly reduce health care costs and unnecessary radiation exposure. © 2013, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Excluded
4204,"Weekly 70 Gy thoracic radiotheraphy concurrent with docetaxel or paclitaxel after induction chemotherapy of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: Prospective study of tolerance and efficacy Introduction: Chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) constitute the standard care of patients with inoperable/unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. However, the optimal schedule of treatment remains to be determined. Method(s): A prospective study was conducted in patients with locally advanced stage IIIA or IIIB NSCLC, to determine the tolerability and local control obtained with 7 weekly courses of concurrent chemo-radiotherapy using Docetaxel (D: 20 mg/m2) or Paclitaxel (P: 60 mg/m2) and TRT (2 Gy daily Monday through Friday, totalizing 70 Gy in the seven weeks), after 3 cycles of cisplatinum-based induction chemotherapy (cisplatinum + gemcitabine +/- vinorelbine). Result(s): From December 1999 to December 2004, fifty two out of 129 patients treated with induction chemotherapy and at least with stable disease were considered eligible for analysis. Twenty seven were treated with docetaxel (D) and twenty five with paclitaxel (P). The average of weeks of treatment was 5 for D (range 7-3) and 6 for P (7-1), and 40% and 58% of patients respectively in each group completed 7 weeks and received the programmed doses. Significant toxicity during concurrent therapy included (D/P %): esophagitis (grade I, 22/18; grade II, 25/29; grade III, 30/8), pneumonitis (grades I-II, 14/5), diarrhea (grades I-II, 14/0). The percentage of local progression and median time elapsed were 41% and 180 days in the D group of patients, and 46% and 240 days in the P group. Conclusion(s): No definitive conclusions can be made, considering the small size of the sample in this study, but the observed trends suggest that concurrent chemo-radiotherapy employing TRT and Docetaxel or Paclitaxel administered weekly offer similar local efficacy, Paclitaxel showing a lower toxicity.",Excluded
4354,"Noncancer disease incidence in the atomic bomb survivors: 1958-1986 Using the longitudinal data of the Adult Health Study (AHS) cohort collected during 1958-1986, we examined for the first time the relationship between exposure to ionizing radiation and the incidence of 19 nonmalignant disorders in the A-bomb survivors. Affected individuals were ascertained through the three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases which are encoded in the AHS database subsequent to diagnoses made on the basis of general laboratory tests, physical examinations, and history-taking conducted during biennial AHS examinations. The disease onset time was estimated using the mid-point between the AHS examination data when the disease was initially reported and the previously attended disease-free examination date. Dosimetry System 86 organ doses judged to be most appropriate were used. Tests of dose effects were performed assuming a linear relative risk model with stratified background incidence. For the entire study period, significant excess risk was detected for uterine myoma (P < 0.001), chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (P = 0.006), and thyroid disease (P < 0.0001), defined broadly as the presence of one or more of certain noncancerous thyroid conditions. The incidence of myocardial infarction was shown to be increased (P = 0.03) in later years (1968-1986) among the younger heavily exposed AHS subjects, confirming the results of the recent Life Span Study (LSS) noncancer mortality report on coronary heart disease. The findings for uterine myoma may serve as additional evidence indicating benign tumor growth as a possible consequence of radiation exposure. Our results indicating the involvement of radiation in the development of liver diseases are consistent with the report of increased mortality from liver cirrhosis with radiation dose in the LSS cohort. An effect of age at exposure was detected for nonmalignant thyroid disease (P = 0.02), with an increased risk for those exposed who were under 20 years of age, but not for older survivors. Thus the AHS data suggest that thyroid glands in the young are more radiosensitive not only to the development of malignancies, but also to the development of nonmalignant disorders as well. The findings hold independently of the dose effects observed for thyroid cancer. This study also shows that for the period 1958-1986 new occurrences of lens opacity are not increased with radiation dose (P = 0.39) in the AHS subjects.",Included
4411,"Effects of a closed space environment on gene expression in hair follicles of astronauts in the International Space Station Adaptation to the space environment can sometimes pose physiological problems to International Space Station (ISS) astronauts after their return to earth. Therefore, it is important to develop healthcare technologies for astronauts. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using hair follicles, a readily obtained sample, to assess gene expression changes in response to spaceflight adaptation. In order to investigate the gene expression changes in human hair follicles during spaceflight, hair follicles of 10 astronauts were analyzed by microarray and real time qPCR analyses. We found that spaceflight alters human hair follicle gene expression. The degree of changes in gene expression was found to vary among individuals. In some astronauts, genes related to hair growth such as FGF18, ANGPTL7 and COMP were upregulated during flight, suggesting that spaceflight inhibits cell proliferation in hair follicles.Copyright © 2016 Terada et al.

3840,"Indeterminate nodules by the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology in Israel: Frequency, and risk of malignancy after reclassification of follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like features Objective: We aimed to determine the frequency and risk of malignancy (ROM) for indeterminate thyroid nodules, categories III (B3) and IV (B4) of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC), at a large institution in Israel. Additionally, we investigated the impact of redefining follicular neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) as non-malignant on malignancy rates. Method(s): In this retrospective study of all thyroid fine needle aspirations (FNAs) performed at Tel Aviv-Sourasky Medical Center between January 2013 and December 2015, we assessed ROM for B3 and B4 nodules. Potential risk factors thought to affect a-priori ROM were assessed. Suspected NIFTP lesions were re-examined, and if proven, reclassified as benign. Result(s): 3701 nodules were sampled in 2919 FNAs performed on 2674 patients. B3 reports comprised 7.7% of all nodules (n = 284); B4 represented 3.6% (n = 132). In multivariate logistic regression, male gender, being of former Soviet Union origin, and smoking increased ROM for B3 nodules by a factor of 7.97 (P = 0.002; CI: 2.2-23.4), 9.15 (P = 0.021; CI:1.4-60.0), and 11.0 (P = 0.001; CI 2.8-44.8), respectively. Reclassifying NIFTP decreased ROM from 14% to 12.5% for B3, and from 26.7% to 25% for B4 nodules. NIFTP comprised 9.5% of previously diagnosed resected malignant tumors. Conclusion(s): The relative frequencies of B3 and B4 nodules and their associated malignancy rates were consistent with previous series. Risk factors identified for malignancy may help characterize patients most likely to benefit from surgery. Reclassifying NIFTP had a substantial impact on the ROM in the resected tumors previously diagnosed as malignant.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd, BASO ~ The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology",Excluded
3698,"The results of hypofractionated radiotherapy in 31 patients with high-grade gliomas In this prospective study, we investigated the effects of hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with high-grade gliomas. About 31 patients with glioblastoma multiforme or anaplastic astrocytoma were studied between October 2003 and December 2004. Hypofractionated radiotherapy (3 Gy/fraction/day) was delivered to a total dose of 45 Gy in 15 fractions in 10 patients (32%) who had total excision before radiotherapy and to a total dose of 54 Gy in 18 fractions in 21 patients (68%) who had subtotal excision or biopsy alone. Sex, age, type of surgery, tumor grade, Karnofsky performance status, time between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy, and total radiotherapy dose were analyzed as potential prognostic factors for survival using the univariate log-rank method. The median follow-up was 15 months (4-16 months). A total of 15 patients (48%) died of their illness; 16 patients (52%) were still alive at the last follow-up. The median survival time was 8 months. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 40%. Type of surgery, timing of radiotherapy after surgery, and initial Karnofsky performance status were significant prognostic factors for survival. No grade 3-4 acute or late neurotoxicity was observed. The tolerance of patients to hypofractionated RT was not different from that for conventional radiotherapy. This treatment schedule can be used for patients with high-grade gliomas. Future investigations are needed to determine the optimal fractionation for high-grade gliomas. © Humana Press Inc. 2007.",Excluded
3699,"Direct repair for treatment of isthmic spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis: Clinical and radiographic results at least 10 years follow-up Introduction: Direct isthmic repair is a very effective surgical technique for the treatment of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis in the young age. This surgical technique compared to the traditional fusion techniques allows to preserve lumbar spine mobility reducing the risk of an adjacent segment disease. Aim of the study was to analyze in a retrospective way patients who underwent direct repair for isthmic spondylolysis in order to evaluate the onset of degenerative diseases or of a vertebral slippage worsening at long-term follow-up. Method(s): From 1996 to 2003 45 patients, 32 males and 13 females, underwent isthmic direct repair. Inclusion criteria were: low grade spondilolysthesis, age ranged between 11 and 25 years, low back pain from at least 6 months and resistant to conservative treatment, no degenerative diseases at the involved and adjacent level. Radiographic evaluation was performed with pre-operative lumbar x-ray and MRI and post-operative lumbar x-ray at regular intervals. In all patients the grade of degeneration at the treated and adjacent level was evaluated with the UCLA classification; the presence of an instability and the spinopelvic harmony value were also evaluated. Result(s): Median age was of 15 years (range 11-25). Median follow-up was of 12 years (10-16). Good clinical outcome was observed in the 98 % of the patients, in 2 patients an hardware failure which requested a surgical revision with a traditional fusion was observed, in 1 patient a spondylodiscitis involving the adjacent level was observed at 7 years follow-up. Radiographic analysis showed no worsening of the vertebral slippage, a complete fusion of the lysis in the 94 % of patients, no bone resorption, no statistically significant variation in the spinopelvic harmony value, a one grade worsening of the UCLA classification value only in the 10 % of patients. In these patients a concomitant alteration of the spinopelvic harmony value was observed. Nor the worsening in the UCLA classification grade none the alteration of the spinopelvic harmony influenced the clinical outcome in our series. Conclusion(s): Direct repair is a valid and reliable surgical treatment possibility for lumbar isthmic spondylolysis. Its use allows, in young symptomatic patients, to preserve the motility of the treated level in order to avoid, at over 10 years follow-up, the onset of degenerative changes to the treated and adjacent discs and zygaphofiseal joints, preserving also, a good spinopelvic harmony)over time.",Excluded
4287,"Keratinocyte apoptosis in epidermal remodeling and clearance of psoriasis induced by UV radiation Psoriasis is a common chronic skin disorder, but the mechanisms involved in the resolution and clearance of plaques remain poorly defined. We investigated the mechanism of action of UVB, which is highly effective in clearing psoriasis and inducing remission, and tested the hypothesis that apoptosis is a key mechanism. To distinguish bystander effects, equal erythemal doses of two UVB wavelengths were compared following in vivo irradiation of psoriatic plaques; one is clinically effective (311 nm) and one has no therapeutic effect on psoriasis (290 nm). Only 311 nm UVB induced significant apoptosis in lesional epidermis, and most apoptotic cells were keratinocytes. To determine clinical relevance, we created a computational model of psoriatic epidermis. Modeling predicted apoptosis would occur in both stem and transit-amplifying cells to account for plaque clearance; this was confirmed and quantified experimentally. The median rate of keratinocyte apoptosis from onset to cell death was 20 minutes. These data were fed back into the model and demonstrated that the observed level of keratinocyte apoptosis was sufficient to explain UVB-induced plaque resolution. Our human studies combined with a systems biology approach demonstrate that keratinocyte apoptosis is a key mechanism in psoriatic plaques clearance, providing the basis for future molecular investigation and therapeutic development.",Excluded
3623,"Lack of high-dose radiation mediated prostate cancer promotion and low-dose radiation adaptive response in the TRAMP mouse model Cancer of the prostate is a highly prevalent disease with a heterogeneous aetiology and prognosis. Current understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the responses of prostate tissue to ionizing radiation exposure, including cancer induction, is surprisingly limited for both high- and low-dose exposures. As population exposure to radiation increases, largely through medical imaging, a better understanding of the response of the prostate to radiation exposure is required. Low-dose radiation-induced adaptive responses for increased cancer latency and decreased cancer frequency have been demonstrated in mouse models, largely for hematological cancers. This study examines the effects of high- and low-dose whole-body radiation exposure on prostate cancer development using an autochthonous mouse model of prostate cancer: TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP). TRAMP mice were exposed to single acute high (2 Gy), low (50 mGy) and repeated low (5 x 50 mGy) doses of X rays to evaluate both the potential prostate cancer promoting effects of high-dose radiation and low-dose adaptive response phenomena in this prostate cancer model. Prostate weights and histopathology were examined to evaluate gross changes in cancer development and, in mice exposed to a single 2 Gy dose, time to palpable tumor was examined. Proliferation (Ki-67), apoptosis, DNA damage (gamma-H2AX) and transgene expression (large T-antigen) were examined within TRAMP prostate sections. Neither high- nor low-dose radiation-induced effects on prostate cancer progression were observed for any of the endpoints studied. Lack of observable effects of high- or low-dose radiation exposure suggests that modulation of tumorigenesis in the TRAMP model is largely resistant to such exposures. However, further study is required to better assess the effects of radiation exposure using alternative prostate cancer models that incorporate normal prostate and in those that are not driven by SV40 large T antigen. © 2013 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded
3551,"Minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy We reported here the data on minimally invasive radioguided parathyroidectomy (MIRP) in a large group of 253 patients enrolled from the whole series of 355 consecutive patients affected by primary hyperparathyroidism (P-HPT) referred to our center. On the basis of preoperative imaging including Sestamibi scintigraphy and neck ultrasound (US), 263 patients (74% of the whole series) with evidence of a solitary parathyroid adenoma (PA) and a normal thyroid gland were addressed to MIRP and in 253 (96%) of them this minimally invasive neck exploration was successfully performed. The MIRP protocol developed in our center consisted of a very low 1 mCi Sestamibi injection in the operating room a few minutes before the start of intervention, thus minimizing the radiation exposure dose to the patient and personnel. No major intraoperative complication was recorded in patients treated by MIRP and only a transient hypocalcemia in 8.5% of cases. The mean duration time for MIRP was 35 min and the mean hospital stay 1.2 days. Local anesthesia was also performed in 62 patients, 54 of whom were elderly patients with concomitant invalidating diseases contraindicating general anesthesia. No HPT relapse was observed during subsequent follow-up. The gamma probe was used also during bilateral neck exploration in the group of 92 patients excluded from MIRP. The most frequent cause of exclusion from MIRP in our series was the presence of concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules (68.5% of cases) that can give false positive results at radioguided surgery. In conclusion, MIRP is an effective treatment in patients with a high likelihood of a solitary PA and a normal thyroid gland at scintigraphy and US so that an accurate preoperative localizing imaging is required for MIRP. A low 1 mCi Sestamibi dose appears sufficient to perform MIRP. Patients with concomitant Sestamibi avid thyroid nodules should be excluded from MIRP. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

4186,"Long term radiological features of radiation-induced lung damage Purpose: To describe the radiological findings of radiation-induced lung damage (RILD) present on CT imaging of lung cancer patients 12 months after radical chemoradiation. Material(s) and Method(s): Baseline and 12-month CT scans of 33 patients were reviewed from a phase I/II clinical trial of isotoxic chemoradiation (IDEAL CRT). CT findings were scored in three categories derived from eleven sub-categories: (1) parenchymal change, defined as the presence of consolidation, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), traction bronchiectasis and/or reticulation; (2) lung volume reduction, identified through reduction in lung height and/or distortions in fissures, diaphragm, anterior junction line and major airways anatomy, and (3) pleural changes, either thickening and/or effusion. Result(s): Six patients were excluded from the analysis due to anatomical changes caused by partial lung collapse and abscess. All remaining 27 patients had radiological evidence of lung damage. The three categories, parenchymal change, shrinkage and pleural change were present in 100%, 96% and 82% respectively. All patients had at least two categories of change present and 72% all three. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were present in 44%, 52% and 37% of patients. Conclusion(s): Parenchymal change, lung shrinkage and pleural change are present in a high proportion of patients and are frequently identified in RILD.

4529,"Comparison of nodal irradiation dose using radiotherapy for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer The present study aimed to compare incidental nodal irradiation (INI) doses using volume-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), 5-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (5F-IMRT) and 3D-conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) treatment plans for patients with thoracic esophageal cancer (EC). A total of 15 patients with thoracic EC were selected for participation between October 2016 and July 2017 at the Hangzhou Cancer Hospital. Regional lymph nodal stations were contoured according to 3D CT-based images of the Japan Esophageal Society Guidelines. All patients were treated with 60 Gy using VMAT, 5F-IMRT and 3D-CRT plans. Dose-volume histograms of planning target volume (PTV), lung, heart, spinal cord and incidental nodal irradiation were compared between the three plans. 5F-IMRT was superior in PTV_V95% (the volume of the PTV receiving 95% of the prescription dose, P=0.003) and the VMAT plan was best in terms of conformal index (P=0.005). V20 and V30were reduced by 10.7-22.6% (P=0.002) and 12.8-21% (P=0.026), respectively, in normal lung tissue using the VMAT plan. 5F-IMRT demonstrated the lowest maximum dose (Dmax) for the spinal cord (P=0.037). For the INI, 3D-CRT exhibited the highest equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values for 106pre (P=0.014) and 106tb-L (P=0.03) in upper-thoracic EC.

However, it remains unclear whether low-field MRI results in sufficient image quality with limited metal artefacts. Therefore, this feasibility study explored the diagnostic value of low-field MRI concerning pathologies associated with problematic TKA's' by comparing low-field MRI findings with CT and surgical findings. Secondly, differences in patellofemoral parameters between supine and weight-bearing low-field MRI were evaluated. Method(s): Eight patients with a problematic TKA were scanned using low-field MRI in weight-bearing and supine conditions. Six of these patients underwent revision surgery. Scans were analysed by a radiologist for pathologies associated with a problematic TKA. Additional patellofemoral and alignment parameters were measured by an imaging expert. MRI observations were compared to those obtained with CT, the diagnosis based on the clinical work-up, and findings during revision surgery. Result(s): MRI observations of rotational malalignment, component loosening and patellofemoral arthrosis were comparable with the clinical diagnosis (six out of eight) and were confirmed during surgery (four out of six). All MRI observations were in line with CT findings (seven out of seven). Clinical diagnosis and surgical findings of collateral excessive laxity could not be confirmed with MRI (two out of eight).

4264,"Survival prediction in high-grade gliomas using CT perfusion imaging Patients with high-grade gliomas usually have heterogeneous response to surgery and chemoirradiation. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate serial changes in tumor volume and perfusion imaging parameters and (2) to determine the value of these data in predicting overall survival (OS). Twenty-nine patients with World Health Organization grades III and IV gliomas underwent magnetic resonance (MR) and computed tomography (CT) perfusion examinations before surgery, and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after radiotherapy. Serial measurements of tumor volumes and perfusion parameters were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to determine their values in predicting OS. Higher trends in blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability-surface area product in the contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) and the non-enhancing lesions (NEL) were found in patients with OS < 18 months compared to those with OS >= 18 months, and these values were significant at selected time points (P < 0.05). Only CT perfusion parameters yielded sensitivities and specificities of >=70 % in predicting 18 and 24 months OS. Pre-surgery BF in the NEL and BV in the CEL and NEL 3 months after radiotherapy had sensitivities and specificities >80 % in predicting 24 months OS in patients with grade IV gliomas. Our study indicated that CT perfusion parameters were predictive of survival and could be useful in assessing early response and in selecting adjuvant treatment to prolong survival if verified in a larger cohort of patients.Copyright © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Excluded
3788,"Late esophageal toxicity using a combination of external beam radiation, intraluminal brachytherapy and 5-fluorouracil infusion in carcinoma of the esophagus One hundred patients with potentially curable squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were treated using a combination of external beam radiation, medium-dose intraluminal brachytherapy (ILBT), and 5-fluorouracil infusion (as a radiosensitizer) from January 1990 to December 1993. The main objective was to determine late toxicity and optimization of the dose of intraluminal radiation. All patients had external radiation of 50 Gy over 5 1/2 weeks, followed by ILBT of 20 Gy for 50 patients (group 1) and 15 Gy for a subsequent 50 patients (group 2), using a dose rate of 315-330 eGy/h with the prescription at 1 cm off axis. The 5-fluorouracil infusion was 500 mg/m2 administered 12 h prior to ILBT. The treatment-related complications among groups 1 and 2 were strictures 24% vs. 8% (p = 0.029), ulceration 30% vs. 28% (p = 0.8), and tracheoesophageal fistulae 12% for both groups. The overall survival for groups 1 and 2 was 8% and 23% at 5 years. The development of life-threatening complications is a major concern and extreme caution is urged before selecting patients for a combination of ILBT and 5-fluorouracil treatment.",Excluded
4153,"Multifraction radiotherapy for palliation of painful bone metastases: 20 Gy versus 30 Gy Aims and Background: To compare 2 multifraction radiotherapy schedules in the palliation of painful bone metastases. Methods and Study design: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 105 patients with a total of 140 painful bone metastases who were treated with 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions. The primary tumors were breast (30%), lung (28%), and prostate (14%). The main sites of irradiation were spine (n = 79) and sacrum or pelvis (n = 39). Pain was graded by patients according to the pain numeric rating scale just before and 1 month after radiotherapy. Pain progression was defined as an increase .2 on pain scale after an initial response. Result(s): The overall response rate at 1 month was 88.6%. Overall response rate was 89.6% in the 20-Gy arm and 87.3% in the 30-Gy arm (p = 0.669). The rate of complete response was statistically better in patients treated with 30 Gy (p = 0.019). The mean reduction in pain was 3.2 in the 20-Gy group and 3.6 in the 30-Gy group. Pain progression was 6.5% and 1.6%, respectively. The incidence of acute toxicity was statistically significantly higher in the 30-Gy arm (23.8%) than in the 20-Gy arm (2.6%) (p = 0.001). One pathologic fracture of the irradiated bone was observed in the 30-Gy arm. Two lesions, one in each group, were re-irradiated for pain recurrence. Pain progression was found in 6.5% of the irradiated lesions in the 20-Gy arm and in 1.6% in the 30-Gy arm. Conclusion(s): In our series, both regimens achieved high rate of pain relief, although the group treated with higher total dose reported better complete response rate. The 30-Gy arm had a significantly higher rate of acute toxicity.Copyright © 2015 INTM, Italy. Published by Wichtig Publishing.",Excluded
3894,"Retrospective analysis of the superior vena cava syndrome in irradiated cancer patients Background: A carcinoma is the underlying cause of superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) in 95-97% of patients. The aim of our study is to retrospectively analyse the outcome of patients after local radiotherapy compared to literature data. Patients and Methods: In 35 consecutively registered patients, irradiated because of SVCS, different primary carcinomas (lung, breast, head-and-neck, Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) were ascertained. Distant metastases had already been diagnosed in 33 patients. Chemotherapy had previously been given in seven patients. Result(s): In 30 patients, radiotherapy obtained a reduction of symptoms within 5-9 days. However, in seven patients, radiotherapy had to be stopped early because of local progress and tumor induced complications. Local recurrences were observed in six patients. The 1-year overall survival rate was 15.6%. Survival rate depended significantly on the performance status (p<0.004). Conclusion(s): Based on literature data our results are comparable regarding the incidence, the radio-oncological procedure and the response to treatment. These data confirm that radiotherapy is the standard treatment in most patients suffering from SVCS. However, it should be determined if endovascular stenting, which is more frequently considered in the last few years in patients with a tumor induced SVCS, may be a useful option as a simultaneous or sequentially given treatment to optimize the palliative effect.",Excluded
3831,"Graded exercise testing for spaceflight We developed and validated a graded exercise protocol suitable for operational use on space station. The new treadmill protocol has three level-grade stages (3-min each) at 70, 80, and 90% of estimated VO2peak. The protocol maintains the third stage speed while grade increases each minute to produce work rates equivalent to 100, 107, and 115% of the estimated VO2peak. We compared the new protocol's peak and submaximal responses to those observed during a NASA graded exercise test. All mean protocol differences, including peak work rate (-1.8%), VO2peak (-6.4%), HRpeak (-2.4%), and VEpeak (-9.7%), were not significantly different from the expected measurement errors. We observed similar results for indices (the oxygen uptake at a HR of 150 and the HR's at 70, 80, and 90% of VO2peak) of the submaximal HR-VO2 relationship.

Method(s): 68 NAFLD patients were recruited in our outpatient department from July,2010 to February 2012 and NAFLD was diagnosed according to the criteria of 2010 Chinese Society of Hepatology. All subjects receive MRS and DEXA measurement at same time. The waist circumstances (WC), hip circumstances (HP) and Waist hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI) were measured at same time. All subjects received serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein(LDL) and HbA1c measurement. Body fat (BF), Fat-free mass index (FFMI), Fat mass index (FMI), Lean mass index (LMI) and fat distribution were observed and calculated. Body fat distribution was calculated and compared to the liver fat content respectively. Result(s): 1. There are linear correlation between liver fat content and waist circumference, BMI, the respectively correlation coefficient were 0.381, 0.383 (P< 0.01). 3. Liver fat content and body fat content has correlation and the correlation coefficient were 0.355 and 0.395 (P<0.05). There are strongest correlation between trunks fat (Trunk%). The correlation coefficient was 0.433 (P<0.01). 4.

Conclusion(s): Liver fat content and body fat distribution were positively correlated. The higher body fat content and upper body fat content were characteristics of fat distribution in subjects with NAFLD and the trunk fat can possibly reflect the liver fat content in clinical practice.",Excluded
4003,"Early Experience and Lessons Learnt with Customized Fenestrated Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Reconstruction for Aortic Arch Pathology in an Asian Population Purpose: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the preferred treatment of descending thoracic aorta pathology. However, TEVAR in the aortic arch remains challenging. Customized fenestrated TEVAR (fTEVAR) allows extension of the proximal seal zone, while preserving the involved supra-aortic vessels. There is a paucity of information on fTEVAR; hence, we aim to evaluate our early experience and lessons learnt with fTEVAR in the aortic arch. Method(s): This is a retrospective single-centre review of fTEVAR endografts for aortic arch pathology over 24 months. Seven patients with mean age of 72.8 years (range 63-84 years) were included. A total of 15 supra-aortic branches were treated [left subclavian artery (n = 7), left carotid artery (n = 5), innominate artery (n = 1), bovine origins (n = 2)], involving a total of nine fenestrations and six scallops. No supra-aortic debranching was required. Result(s): Median follow-up was 15 months. Technical success was 86%, and one patient had malalignment of the fTEVAR endograft requiring salvage with double chimney technique. There were no early endoleaks with one type 2 endoleak detected in the follow-up period. Two access site pseudoaneurysms required intervention. There was a learning curve involved reflected by higher than average mean operative time of 224 min with average radiation dose of 3029.86 mGy and mean contrast volume of 283 mls. Conclusion(s): fTEVAR in the aortic arch is feasible in Asian patients, although there was a learning curve involved, and careful patient selection is advised. Longer term data in a larger population are required to assess its durability.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Excluded
3664,"Tuberculosis among migrant populations in sicily: A field report Background. In the EU, tuberculosis (TB) mainly affects vulnerable people, including migrants. From 2014 to 2017, we have estimated the frequency of both tuberculosis and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) among the migrant population hosted in 41 reception centers in western Sicily (ITaCA network). Materials and Methods. All migrants were consecutively recruited for the screening of TB infection with physical examination and TST in 1,020 migrants and with IGRA in the others 2,690. The screening was carried out 4-8 weeks after landing in Sicily. For all migrants with a positive screening test, chest X-ray and smear examination were performed. LTBI was defined by positivity of TST or IGRA with negative X-ray chest, clinical, and smear examination. Active TB was defined by radiological and/or clinical and/or sputum positivity in a patient with a TST or IGRA positivity. Results. We evaluated a total of 3,710 migrants, of which 89% came from Sub-Saharan countries; 2,811 were males, 899 were females, with a median age of 22 years (IQR: 18-25). TB infection was diagnosed in 501 persons (13.5%) of which 440 (11.8%) had LTBI and 61 had active TB (1.6%): 1 had lymph node TB, 1 had intestinal TB, and 59 had pulmonary TB (38 sputum smear positive TB; no drug-resistant TB were observed).

Method(s): We included 157 consecutive patients who underwent SBRT alone for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer and whose pretreatment lung computed tomography images were available for retrospective review. The pretreatment computed tomography images were evaluated retrospectively for the presence of ILD. The incidence of RP, overall survival (OS) rate, and the incidence of disease progression and local progression were evaluated between patients with ILD (ILD[+]) and without ILD (ILD[-]). Result(s): Pre-existing ILD was identified in 20 patients. The median follow-up period was 39.5 months. The incidences of RP worse than grade 2 (>= Gr2 RP) and worse than grade 3 (>= Gr3 RP) were significantly higher in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (1 year >= Gr2 RP rate, 55.0% versus 13.3%; p < 0.001 and 1year >= Gr3 RP rate 10.0% versus 1.5%; p = 0.020). Multivariate analysis also indicated that ILD(+) was a risk factor for >= Gr2 and >= Gr3 RP, and the volume of the irradiated lung. The OS rate tended to be worse in ILD(+) than ILD(-) (3-year OS, 53.8% versus 70.8%; p = 0.28). No difference was observed in the disease progression or local progression rates. Conclusion(s): Pre-existing ILD was a significant risk factor for symptomatic and severe RP. Prescreening for ILD findings is important for determining the radiation pneumonitis risk when planning SBRT.Copyright © 2014 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Excluded

3492,"Ultra-high resolution whole body prototype CT scanner: Influence of image matrix and slice thickness on image quality in the lung Purpose: To evaluate the effect of 0.25mm slice thickness and 1k image matrix on image quality in HR-CT of the lung. Material(s) and Method(s): 59 subsequent patients underwent a CT of the chest on a clinical prototype scanner (TSX-304R, Toshiba) with the following scanning parameters: 0.25mm slice thickness (128 rows), 0.5 seconds rotation time, target SD at 25HU (AEC), 120 kV, AIDR-3D with FC81. Six series of images were reconstructed as follows (slice thickness in mm/image matrix): 0.25/1k, 0.25/512, 0.5/1k, 0.5/512, 2/1k, and 2/512. By using forced ranking, 2 readers (21, 4 y on staff) blinded to the reconstruction method evaluated the series (6 on 1, random order, 4K monitor) in the categories: (1) definition of bronchioli, (2) conspicuity of vasculature, (3) visibility of fissures/septa, (4) blurriness, (5) noise texture, (6) artifacts, and (7) overall preference. The readers also graded their preference on a free scale from 1=excellent quality to 10=low quality. Image noise (SD in ROI) was measured on all reconstructions within the aorta and in air, radiation dose was recorded. All values were statistically analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA for main and interaction effects, and Kendall's W coefficient of concordance for inter-observer agreement on rankings. Result(s): The image matrix size and slice thickness main effects and their interaction were statistically significant at P<0.05 in all cases, with matrix size generally having a stronger effect than slice thickness. In the categories 1-3, the 1k matrix ranked preferably over 512, and 0.25mm was preferred over 0.5 and 2mm for both readers (forced ranking method). 2mm slices at 1k were preferred for noise texture and artifacts, 0.25mm at 512 ranked the lowest in both categories. On free scale ranking in category 7, both readers preferred 0.5mm at 1k (n.s.) and ranked the 2mm 512 matrix the lowest (P<0.001). The inter-observer agreement (Kendall's W) ranged from 0.89 to 0.93 for categories 1-3, and 0.66 to 0.83 for categories 4-7. The mean DLP was 377.9. SD of image noise varied from 58.1HU (0.25/1k) to 25.8HU (2/512) in air. Conclusion(s): For high-resolution CT of the lung, 1k image matrix provides superior image quality compared with 512 matrix, and 0.25mm slices thickness is mostly preferred over 0.5 and 2 mm.",Excluded

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is also known to be a risk factor for CVD and little is known whether CKD is associated with A-bomb radiation. To examine whether CKD is associated with CVD risk factors or with A-bomb radiation in A-bomb survivors, we classified renal dysfunction in 1,040 A-bomb survivors who were examined in 2004-2007 as normal [n = 121; estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >= 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2)]; mild (n = 686; eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); moderate (n = 217; eGFR 30-59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)); or severe (n = 16; eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Also, we diagnosed subjects in the moderate and severe renal dysfunction groups as having CKD (n = 233; eGFR <59 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). After adjusting for age, gender, and smoking and drinking habits, we looked for an association between renal dysfunction and hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and between renal dysfunction and A-bomb radiation. Hypertension [odds ratio (OR), 1.57; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-2.20, P = 0.009]; DM (OR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.23-2.61, P = 0.002); hyperlipidemia (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.12-2.14, P = 0.008); and MetS (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.32-2.63, P < 0.001) were associated with CKD (moderate/severe renal dysfunction), and hyperlipidemia and MetS were also associated with mild renal dysfunction.

3554,"Evaluation of chest x-ray utilization in nontraumatic chest pain in an academic emergency department Background and Objectives: Overutilization of chest x-rays (CXRs) is costly, inefficient and results in increased radiation exposure. Several studies have proposed clinical decision rules (CDRs), which consist of clinical criteria or risk factors for an abnormal CXR, to minimize CXR utilization in non-traumatic chest pain patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED). The purpose of this study is to evaluate CXR utilization among our ED patients suspected of acute coronary syndrome presenting with non-traumatic chest pain and to assess for clinical criteria/risk factors associated with an abnormal CXR in our population using criteria from previously published CDRs. Method(s): This is a retrospective review, using a single reviewer, of 500 charts of adult patients presenting to the ED with non-traumatic chest pain from January 2016 to December 2017 at Hershey Medical Center in Hershey, PA. Each chart was screened for whether chest x-ray was performed, normal or abnormal x-ray radiologist interpretation, and presence of CDR criteria from 5 previously published studies. Among the abnormal results, we determined which findings were significant enough to lead to a change in clinical management. Result(s): A total of 487 of 500 (97%) non-traumatic chest pain patients received a CXR in the ED. Two hundred and twenty-one patients (45%) who met none of the 14 clinical criteria had a chest x-ray performed. Of those 221 patients, 11 patients (5%) had an abnormality on CXR, 3 (1%) of which led to a change in clinical management. All 3 patients were identified to have a possible pneumonia. The presence of at least 1 risk factor had a sensitivity of 94% for abnormal CXR findings and the absence of all of the 14 clinical criteria resulted in a negative predictive value of 99% for changes in clinical management. Conclusion(s): In this retrospective study, the use of the criteria from the various published CDRs would have reduced total CXRs by 45% among non-traumatic chest pain patients with minimal concern for missed findings. No single CDR perfectly fit our ED population but a selection of criteria from the different CDRs could be combined to create a CDR that fits our patient population. In the future, a prospective study could be performed to see if the combined criteria work as a CDR in our ED.",Excluded

Data consisted of post-isolation interviews with crewmembers, ground support personnel and management, observational data, and public statements by crewmembers. Data was analyzed using the techniques of linguistic anthropology and ethnography., RESULTS: Sub-cultural (organizational and professional) differences played a larger role than national differences in causing misunderstandings in this study. Conversely, some misunderstandings and conflicts were escalated by participants falsely assuming cultural differences or similarities. Comparison between the two heterogeneous crews showed the importance of training, personality factors, and commander and language skills in preventing and alleviating cultural misunderstandings., CONCLUSION: The study revealed a number of ways that cultural differences, real as well as assumed, can play a role and interact with other, non-cultural, factors in causing and/or precipitating conflict situations. It is postulated that such difficulties can be avoided by selecting culturally adaptive crewmembers and by cross-cultural and language training. Also the crew composition and role of commander were found to be important in mitigating conflict situations. Copyright c2002 Lister Science.",Excluded
4068,"Different outdoor professions have different risks - a cross-sectional study comparing non-melanoma skin cancer risk among farmers, gardeners and mountain guides Background: One of the main risk factors for non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the most common cancer worldwide, is solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). This has led to the recognition of NMSC as occupational disease for outdoor workers in several countries. However, outdoor professions are a very heterogeneous group with diverse daily activities and associated UVR exposure. Objective(s): To compare the prevalence of NMSC and associated risk behaviour in different outdoor professions. Method(s): Cross-sectional study among outdoor workers (farmers, gardeners, mountain guides) and indoor workers (office employees) as control group using a paper-based questionnaire on UVR exposure and protective behaviour followed by a skin examination by a dermatologist. Result(s): A total of 563 participants (46.9% women, 46.9 +/- 13.8 years) consisting of 348 outdoor workers (38.8% farmer, 35.3% gardener, 25.9% mountain guides) and 215 indoor workers were included in the study between March and September 2017. NMSC incl. actinic keratosis was diagnosed in 33.3% of mountain guides, 27.4% of farmers, 19.5% of gardeners and in 5.6% of indoor workers. Significant differences were seen between the outdoor professions with mountain guides at highest risk compared to farmers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.2-5.7). Substantial differences between the professions were also seen in skin cancer screening attendance rates (indoor worker 61.4%, mountain guides 57.8%, farmers 31.9%, gardeners 27.6%), daily UVR exposure during work and protective behaviour such as sunscreen use during work. Conclusion(s): Different outdoor professions have significant different risks for NMSC and show different risk behaviour. Tailoring prevention efforts to different professions based on their individual needs could be the key to lower the global burden of (occupational) NMSC.Copyright © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology",Excluded
3679,"Occupational ionising radiation and risk of basal cell carcinoma in US radiologic technologists (1983-2005) OBJECTIVE: To determine risk for incident basal cell carcinoma from cumulative low-dose ionising radiation in the US radiologic technologist cohort., METHODS: We analysed 65,719 Caucasian technologists who were cancer-free at baseline (1983-1989 or 1994-1998) and answered a follow-up questionnaire (2003-2005). Absorbed radiation dose to the skin in mGy for estimated cumulative occupational radiation exposure was reconstructed for each technologist based on badge dose measurements, questionnaire-derived work history and protection practices, and literature information. Radiation-associated risk was assessed using Poisson regression and included adjustment for several demographic, lifestyle, host and sun exposure factors., RESULTS: Cumulative mean absorbed skin dose (to head/neck/arms) was 55.8 mGy (range 0-1735 mGy). For lifetime cumulative dose, we did not observe an excess radiation-related risk (excess relative risk/Gy=-0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.52). However, we observed that basal cell carcinoma risk was increased for radiation dose received before age 30 (excess relative risk/Gy=0.59, 95% CI -0.11 to 1.42) and before 1960 (excess relative risk/Gy=2.92, 95% CI 1.39 to 4.45)., CONCLUSIONS: Basal cell carcinoma risk was unrelated to low-dose radiation exposure among radiologic technologists. Because of uncertainties in dosimetry and sensitivity to model specifications, both our null results and our findings of excess risk for dose received before age 30 and exposure before 1960 should be interpreted with caution.

4059,"Sun exposure and pterygium of the eye: a dose-response curve PURPOSE: To present a quantitative analysis of pterygium and ocular sun exposure, a dose-response curve, and a discussion of the health-promotion implications of the findings., METHODS: A hospital-based, case-control study was conducted in Perth, Western Australia. Case subjects had surgical removal of a pterygium; control subjects had an ear, nose, or throat procedure. A lifetime history of residence, sun exposure patterns, and use of hats, spectacles, and sunglasses was obtained at interview. Measures of potential sun exposure included latitude, daily sunshine hours, and daily global solar radiant energy. The most complex estimate of actual sun exposure was the daily ocular solar radiation dose, calculated from climatic data, time spent outdoors not under shade, and the use of hats and spectacles., RESULTS: There were strong positive associations between pterygium and measures of potential and actual sun exposure. Associations were as strong for whole-life measures as for those in any specific age range. Pterygium odds ratios increased with exposure level; the odds ratio was 4.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 10.9) for the highest quarter of the daily sun exposure. The strongest associations were seen for the estimated daily ocular solar radiation dose, with an odds ratio of 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 19.7) for the highest quarter of exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Pterygium is strongly related to ocular sun exposure, with little evidence that exposure during any particular period of life is more important than in other periods; the implication for prevention of pterygium is that ocular protection is beneficial at all ages.",Excluded
3680,"Deciphering acute shoulder trauma with normal initial X-ray: Contributions of ultrasonography and MRI Introduction: Shoulder trauma with normal radiographs is a frequent emergency presentation. The predominance of pain makes clinical examination unreliable, and complementary imaging is often needed for diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in deciphering such trauma. The study hypothesis was that MRI can confirm most diagnoses and reveal occult lesions. Method(s): 48 patients with a median age of 33 years (IQR, 22-48.75), admitted to the Emergency Department between February and September 2016, were prospectively included. All had normal X-ray and underwent emergency and deferred emergency (D + 7-10) clinical examination, and US and MRI at D + 7-14. The same examinations were repeated to establish diagnosis and initiate treatment. MRI was considered as gold-standard for definite diagnosis. Result(s): Diagnoses comprised: 14 shoulder contusions; 13 rotator cuff tears; 8 acromioclavicular sprains; 6 fractures: 3 greater tuberosity, 2 humeral head, 1 lateral quarter of the clavicle; 3 subluxations or anterior dislocations with spontaneous reduction; 1 posterior dislocation with spontaneous reduction; 1 case of resorption of calcification in the pectoralis major tendon; 1 case of coracobrachialis strain; and 1 partial pectoralis major detachment. Concordance with final diagnosis was 42% (20/48) on initial clinical examination and 52% (25/48) on reassessment. On US, concordance was 71% (34/48), with 82% positive predictive value for cuff tear and 0% for instability. MRI was contributive in all cases, revealing 48 abnormal signals in 41 patients, thus establishing 48 diagnoses. Conclusion(s): Except in precise diagnostic situations such as rotator cuff tear, US is not a contributive examination, completely overlooking shoulder instability and bone contusion. MRI should play an increasing role in deciphering these traumas. Level of Evidence: II; prospective cohort study.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS",Excluded
4313,"The role of dose escalation with intracavitary brachytherapy in the treatment of localized CNS malignancies: Outcomes and toxicities of a prospective study Purpose: This single-institution prospective study was designed to investigate the feasibility and safety of dose escalation with GliaSite (Proxima Therapeutics Inc., Alpharetta, GA) brachytherapy for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent central nervous system (CNS) tumors after neurosurgical resection. We now report mature results of this trial, its outcomes, and a toxicity profile. Methods and Materials: Ten adult consecutive patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed CNS malignancies underwent GliaSite brachytherapy after maximally safe neurosurgical resection between 2004 and 2007. GliaSite balloon was placed intraoperatively, and the size was selected so as to conform to the surgical cavity. Low-dose-rate radiation was delivered with an aqueous solution of organically bound 125I (Iotrex: sodium 3-(125I)-iodo-4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate; Proxima Therapeutics Inc.), introduced into the balloon portion of the device via a subcutaneous port. Two to 3 weeks later, the device was filled with Iotrex for a median dwell time of 94.3 hours (range, 68.0-120.5 hours), after which the balloon was explanted. A commercial 3-D planning system was used for a detailed analysis of dosimetry. Median dose of 52.0 Gy (range, 45.0-60.0 Gy) was prescribed 0.5-1.0 cm from the balloon surface. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria were used to assess acute and long-term toxicities associated with this technique. Followup was assessed with MRI scans and was available on all enrolled patients. Result(s): Median followup for surviving patients was 38 months (range, 18-57 months). Mean size of GliaSite balloon was 3.4 cm (range, 2.0-4.0 cm). Mean volume of filling was 19.0 cc (range, 4.0-35.0 cc). Median activity of Iotrex was 301.6 mCi (range, 95.0-515.4 mCi). Median survival was 14.0 months for the entire cohort after the treatment with the GliaSite device. Of our cohort, 6/10 (60%) patients sustained recurrence (20% local and 40% distant). Median time to recurrence after treatment with GliaSite was 8.0 months, and median time to death after recurrence was 7.5 months. There were no RTOG Grade 3 or 4 acute or late toxicities. Followup MRI imaging did not identify any evidence of radiation necrosis. Conclusion(s): Our data indicate that treatment with GliaSite balloon brachytherapy is feasible and safe, while rendering acceptable local control and minimal acute and long-term toxicities for newly diagnosed and recurrent CNS malignancies. These encouraging results compel us to embark on testing larger numbers of patients with this treatment modality. © 2010 American Brachytherapy Society.",Excluded
4020,"Effects of proton pump inhibitor use on the esophageal microbial community Background: Changes in the esophageal microbiome correlate with esophageal disease, but the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drugs are incompletely characterized. Our objective was to identify the effects of PPI use on the microbial community of the esophagus. Method(s): Mucosal biopsies of the distal esophagus were analyzed using a customized esophageal microbiome qPCR panel array (EMB). Patient demographics, use of PPIs, duration of use and dose were recorded. Result(s): Fifty-eight patients were included. Mean age was 60.5 years. Ninety percent (52/58) of patients were on PPIs. Mean dose was 42.7 mg. Mean duration of use was 2.5 years. The use of PPIs led to a significant difference in absolute levels of only one organism, Actinomyces, in the entire array (p < 0.01). Among patients who used proton pump inhibitors, there was no significant association between dose and absolute levels of any organism. Similarly, there was no association between duration of use and absolute levels of any organism. Conclusion(s): PPI use does not seem to cause significant changes in the distal esophageal microbial community. Future studies with larger sample sizes and esophageal pH testing should be performed to determine the level of acidity and its relationship to the microbial community.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
3817,"Stereotactic radiosurgery for pituitary adenoma invading the cavernous sinus Object. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) treatment of pituitary adenomas that have invaded the cavernous sinus. Methods. Sixteen patients were treated with GKS: three with nonfunctional adenomas and 13 with hormone-secreting (seven growth hormone [GH] and six adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) adenomas. More than 16 Gy and 30 Gy were delivered to the tumor margin for nonfunctioning tumors and functioning tumors, respectively, keeping the dose to the optic pathways below 10 Gy. The median follow up was 3 years. Tumor growth control was achieved in all cases. In GH-producing tumors, four of six cases evaluated were endocrinologically normalized (serum GH < 10 mIU/L, somatomedin C < 450 ng/ml), and the remaining two cases also showed a steady decrease in the GH and somatomedin level. In ACTH-producing tumors, three of six cases were endocrinologically normalized (24-hour urinary-free cortisol < 90 mg/day), two were unchanged, and one showed hormonal recurrence 3 years after radiosurgery. Notably, there were no cases of permanent hypopituitarism or visual symptoms caused by radiosurgery. Conclusions. The authors data indicate that GKS can be a safe salvage therapy for invading pituitary adenomas, with effectiveness equivalent to conventional radiation therapy but with less risk of causing radiation-induced injury to the surrounding structures.",Excluded
4266,"Relationship of Th17/treg cells and radiation pneumonia in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background/Aim: Radiation pneumonia is a main side-effect that has limited the clinical usage of radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma. T helper cells 17 (Th 17) and T regulatory cells (Tregs) play an important role in inflammatory diseases. The balance between Treg and Th17 cells is a key factor in the progression of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Whether Tregs and Th17 cells are predictive factors of radiation pneumonia has not yet been reported. In this study, we investigated the relationships of Treg/Th17 cells and radiation pneumonia in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty-eight patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer who received radical and palliative radiotherapy were enrolled. The levels of Th17 and Treg cells in the blood of patients were detected using flow cytometry at the time point of pre-radiotherapy, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th week from the start of radiation and 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Radiation pneumonia was evaluated according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group's acute radiation pneumonia standards, with the endpoint being grade 2 or above radiation pneumonia. Result(s): There were 24 cases of radiation pneumonia in 148 cases of locally advanced esophageal cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy. Th17 cells increased and, in contrast, Treg cells decreased in the radiation pneumonia group. The change in the ratio of Th17/Treg was more pronounced and the difference was statistically significant from the 5th week after irradiation compared to patients with no radiation pneumonia (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in dosimetric parameters, including V5, V20, V30 and mean lung dose (MLD) and clinical factors, such as gender, age, smoking history, history of surgery and chemotherapy. Conclusion(s): The ratio of Th17/Treg cells may be an effective predictive factor of radiation pneumonia.",Excluded
3898,"Sun protection strength of a hydroquinone 4%/retinol 0.3% preparation containing sunscreens BACKGROUND: Dyschromias are common and significantly impact patients' quality of life. Formulas containing hydroquinone 4% are effective in these conditions. Since exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can worsen disease and complicate treatment, the incorporation of sunscreens can avert this problem., METHODS: We tested the sun protection factor of a hydroquinone formulation (Lustra-Ultra, TaroPharma, Hawthorne, NY) containing avobenzone 3%, and octinoxate 7.5% according to the FDA Sunscreen Monograph on 20 volunteer subjects. We also determined the UVR absorbance spectrum of the preparation., RESULTS: The mean sun protection factor (SPF) of 21.7 satisfied labeling requirements for SPF 20. The formulation exhibited strongest photoprotection near the wavelengths of peak sun burning effectiveness in the UVB region and maintains significant UVR absorbance through the entire UVA region., CONCLUSIONS: Avobenzone 3% and octinoxate 7.5% provide broad spectrum UV protection. Incorporating these sunscreens into a hydroquinone preparation simplifies the treatment regimen while providing significant photoprotection for patients being treated for dyschromia.",Excluded
3563,"Late gastrointestinal complications after pelvic radiotherapy: radiation enteritis INTRODUCTION: Radiation enteritis is a complication of radiation therapy for pelvic tumours. It appears after a variable period of time and is often progressive. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyse our experience of 77 cases (52 females and 25 males) diagnosed with radiation enteritis or proctitis between 1986 and 2006. RESULT(S): The most frequent location of radiation injury is ileum (55 patients, 71%), followed by rectum (22 patients, 28%). Twenty-eight patients (36%) were medically managed and 49 (64%) required surgical treatment. In 41 (53%) of the patients the affected region was resected, in 5 (7%) a by-pass was performed and in 3 (4%) a terminal colostomy. Surgical mortality was 4% (3 cases) and the complication rate 9% (7 cases). Twelve patients (16%) presented recurrence of radiation-related illness. Excluding those cases deceased because of tumoral progression, 5-year survival rate was 90% and 10-year survival rate 83%. CONCLUSION(S): Radiation enteritis must be initially conservatively managed, but in those cases without response, surgery is indicated. Surgical treatment should not be delayed fearing postoperative complications, which are more susceptible to appear in deteriorated patients. If technically possible, the affected region should be resected, because complications may appear later at this damaged location.",Excluded
4093,"The influence of radiotherapy techniques on the plan quality and on the risk of secondary tumors in patients with pituitary adenoma Background: This planning study compares different radiotherapy techniques for patients with pituitary adenoma, including flatness filter free mode (FFF), concerning plan quality and secondary malignancies for potentially young patients. The flatness filter has been described as main source of photon scatter. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven patients with pituitary adenoma were included. An Elekta SynergyTM linac was used in the treatment planning system Oncentra and for the measurements. 3D plans, IMRT, and VMAT plans and non-coplanar varieties were considered. The plan quality was evaluated regarding homogeneity, conformity, delivery time and dose to the organs at risk. The secondary malignancy risk was calculated from dose volume data and from measured dose to the periphery using different models for carcinoma and sarcoma risk. Result(s): The homogeneity and conformity were nearly unchanged with and without flattening filter, neither was the delivery time found substantively different. VMAT plans were more homogenous, conformal and faster in delivery than IMRT plans. The secondary cancer risk was reduced with FFF both in the treated region and in the periphery. VMAT plans resulted in a higher secondary brain cancer risk than IMRT plans, but the risk for secondary peripheral cancer was reduced. Secondary sarcoma risk plays a minor role. No advantage was found for non-coplanar techniques. The FFF delivery times were not shortened due to additional monitor units needed and technical limitations. The risk for secondary brain cancer seems to depend on the irradiated volume. Secondary sarcoma risk is much smaller than carcinoma risk in accordance to the results of the atomic bomb survivors. The reduction of the peripheral dose and resulting secondary malignancy risk for FFF is statistically significant. However, it is negligible in comparison to the risk in the treated region. Conclusion(s): Treatments with FFF can reduce secondary malignancy risk while retaining similar quality as with flattening filter and should be preferred. VMAT plans show the best plan quality combined with lowest peripheral secondary malignancy risk, but highest level of second brain cancer risk. Taking this into account VMAT FFF seems the most advantageous technique for the treatment of pituitary adenomas with the given equipment.Copyright © 2020 The Author(s).",Excluded
3420,"Assessment of DNA damage in nuclear medicine personnel--comparative study with the alkaline comet assay and the chromosome aberration test Despite much research over the last few decades, there still remains considerable uncertainty as to the genetic impact of ionizing radiation on human populations, particularly at low levels. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the genetic hazards due to occupational exposure of low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. The assessment of primary DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes of medical staff was performed using the alkaline comet assay and the data obtained were compared with the results of conventional cytogenetic biodosimetry using the chromosome aberration (CA) test. Altogether 120 subjects (60 exposed and 60 controls) participated in the study. Statistically significant increases in primary DNA damage and increased frequencies of CAs compared to controls were observed. Within the exposed population, significant inter-individual differences in DNA damage were found, indicating differences in genome sensitivity. Age and gender were not confounding factors, while smoking enhanced the levels of primary DNA damage only in control subjects, as revealed by both biomarkers studied. The present study suggests that genotoxic damage results from exposure to chronic low doses of ionizing radiation in nuclear medicine departments. Therefore, the exposed medical personnel should carefully comply with the radiation protection procedures and should minimize radiation exposure where possible to avoid potential genotoxic effects. The results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the actual risk to the radiation exposed individuals. According to our results, the alkaline comet assay and CA test are sensitive biomarkers that can be used as additional complements to physical dosimetry for assessing exposure to radiation in nuclear medicine personnel.",Included
4206,"Ocular toxicity after 3D-conformal radiotherapy for non-hodgkin orbital lymphoma Purpose: The orbital Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a rare malignancy, usually localized and low aggressive, which management requires the irradiation of whole orbital cavity. This involves structures, as lens, particularly sensible to radiation effects. This single institution study wants to evaluate the acute and late siDe effects of conformal 3D irradiation for primary NHL. Materials: We retrospectively evaluated 59 consecutive patients (20 women and 39 men, mean age 59 +/- 16 yrs) with stage IEA NHL from 1986 to 2010. The disease was localized in the left eye in 34 (58%) patients, in the right in 21 (35%), bilateral in 4 (7%), and involved the orbit in 30 (51%), the conjunctiva in 18 (31%) and other orbital structures in 11 (18%). All patients underwent 3D-conformal radiotherapy after diagnosis (by pathological or cytological examination), staging (haematological tests, total body CT, bone marrow biopsy, orbital CT or MR) and in 4 cases after chemotherapy. The median dose was 30.6 Gy (range 30-40 Gy) with a standard fractioning (1.8 Gy per day) and the PTV consisted of whole orbital cavity. The bolus (thickness 0.5-1 cm) was used only in case of superficial localizations (25%). We described acute and late toxicity incidence and calculated the risk factors for cataract, using chi-square or Fisher test as appropriate. Result(s): The mean follow up was 68.3 +/- 55 months. It was performed by clinical and radiological examinations (total body CT, lymphatic stations US) and by ophthalmic visits, every 46 months during the first 5 years and then once a year. The local control was obtained in 58 (98.3%) patients. According to the RTOG scale, the graDe (G) 1 and 2 acute effects were 37% and 24% respectively, no G3-4 were observed in 39%. Thirty-six (61%) patients had no late toxicity, 22(37%) presented low effects (G1-2) and only 1 (2%) had retinopathy and bilateral cataract (G3). The table 1 reports the adverse effects. The cataract developed in 20 (34%) patients 2-7 yrs after radiotherapy was the more common late effect. It was easily treated by surgery. We considered as possible risk factors for cataract: age >60 yrs, Karnofsky performance status < 90%, total dose > 30.6 Gy, use of bolus and chemotherapy association. Total dose > 30.6 Gy resulted significantly associated (p<0.005). Cataract was developed in 13 of 24 patients (54%) treated with dose >30.6 (median 36 Gy), in 7 of 35 (20%) with dose <= 30.6. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): 3D conformal radiotherapy was effective and well tolerated, with low-graDe acute and late toxicity, for patients with orbital lymphoma. Cataract was the more frequent siDe effect, it was associated with a total dose > 30.6 Gy and easily treated with surgery. Eyesight was well preserved.",Excluded

Untreated and radiated wild type (WT) and AMPKalpha(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were analyzed by immunoblotting using total- and phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Histone H2Ax was examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cell cycle and survival of WT and AMPKalpha(-/-) MEFs was also evaluated following 8 Gy by IR., RESULTS: AMPK subunits were found widely expressed in normal and cancer epithelial cells. IR increased subunit protein levels and stimulated gene transcription in cancer cells. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed enhanced basal total levels of ATM and phosphorylation of its substrates histone H2Ax, but inhibited response of these markers and of checkpoint kinase Chk2 phosphorylation to IR. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs showed increased basal levels of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1), but lack of response of both genes to IR. These cells had increased basal levels and activation of the Akt-mTOR-p70(S6K)/4-EBP1 signalling pathway. IR increased Akt, p70(S6K) and 4-EBP1 phosphorylation in WT-MEFs, but this was reduced in AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs. AMPKalpha(-/-)-MEFs failed to arrest at the G2-M checkpoint after IR and showed a trend for radio-resistance in proliferation assays., CONCLUSIONS: AMPK is widely expressed in human normal and cancer epithelial cells and its gene transcription, protein levels, and enzymatic activity is stimulated by IR. Work with AMPKalpha knockout cells suggests that AMPK (i) may mediate a suppressive regulation on basal expression and activity of ATM and its downstream effector pathways Chk2/p53-p21(cip1) and Akt-mTOR, (ii) facilitates the normal response of these pathways to IR and, (iii) mediates the IR-induced G2-M checkpoint.

3827,"Postoperative chest radiograph after open reduction internal fixation of clavicle fractures: a necessary practice? Hypothesis/Background: Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a rare but serious complication of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of clavicular fractures. Many institutions use postoperative chest radiographs to evaluate for this complication despite a lack of data to support this routine practice. Due to concerns of radiation exposure and health care costs, this practice may not be necessary. This study determined the rate of iatrogenic pneumothorax after clavicular ORIF with plate fixation at a single institution over 8 years. We hypothesized that postoperative chest radiographs would identify a very low rate of pneumothorax in patients with isolated clavicular fractures with no serious preoperative pulmonary injury. Method(s): A retrospective review was performed identifying all patients undergoing clavicular ORIF with plate fixation at a single Level I trauma center by 3 board-certified orthopedic surgeons from 2009 to 2017. Patients without at least 1 postoperative chest radiograph were excluded. We determined patient demographics and rate of preoperative and postoperative pneumothorax. Result(s): We identified 89 patients without preoperative pneumothorax who underwent clavicular ORIF with at least 1 postoperative chest radiograph. Within this group, no patients (0%) had a new postoperative iatrogenic pneumothorax. Discussion/Conclusion: Within this series of 89 patients with isolated clavicular fractures without preoperative pneumothorax, no iatrogenic pneumothoraces occurred after plate fixation. Therefore, for patients undergoing ORIF of isolated clavicular fractures obtaining a postoperative chest radiograph may be an unnecessary practice, especially given their low sensitivity. Future high-powered studies are needed to validate this finding.Copyright © 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees",Excluded
3510,"Dynamic magnetic resonance of pelvic floor in the diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunctions Aim: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvic floor (DMRPF) is a complementary diagnostic tool allowing dynamic and/or static assessment of all compartments of the pelvis (anterior, middle and posterior) in a single study. Method(s): We present a prospective and consecutive series of 288 patients evaluated between April 2005 and November 2013 undergoing DMRPF. Of the total patient number, 10 (3.47%) were male. Result(s): Due to the coexistence of pathology in different parts of the pelvic floor - more often in women - diagnostic confirmation is necessary so that the appropriate treatments can be accomplished in one single surgical approach. Outlet obstruction syndrome (OOS) was present in 262 patients. In 239 (82.4%) patients, an anterior rectocele was confirmed. In 55 (23%) of these cases, an anterior retrocele was the only finding. In 207 patients, other abdomino-pelvic anatomical dislocations were found that had not been clinically suspected or detected during physical examination. Conclusion(s): DMRPF is a study that does not expose patients to ionizing radiation providing dynamic interactive anatomical and functional data at rest and during provocative manoeuvers. Multi-plane imaging provides a clear view of the organs in the pelvis and the pelvic floor muscles which is not always accurately detected on physical examination. Currently, DMRPF is the recommended study designed to evaluate pelvic floor dysfunction as it can be used to confirm presumptive diagnoses and to quantify the impact of the dislocation of pelvic floor viscera, to define intestinal emptying dynamics, and to outline inadequate relaxation of the puborectalis during straining and simulated evacuation.",Excluded

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 300 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation, 68.5 +/- 8.1 years; 131 male and 169 female) who had undergone at least one ICM-enhanced perfusion brain CT scan, had their baseline and follow-up serum creatinine levels available, and had not undergone additional contrast-enhanced examinations 72 hours before and after a time window of interest were included. The study population was divided into three groups: single-dose group and groups of patients who had received multiple contrast administrations in the time window of interest with the minimum contrast repeat interval either within 4 hours (0-4-hour group) or between 4 to 48 hours (4-48-hour group). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between AKI and repeated ICM administrations. A similar supplementary analysis was performed including both ICM and GBCA. RESULT(S): When ICM was only considered ignoring GBCA, among 300 patients, 207 patients received a single dose of ICM, 58 had repeated doses within 4 hours (0-4-hour group), and 35 patients had repeated doses between 4 to 48 hours (4-48-hour group). Most patients (> 95%) had a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of >= 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. AKI occurred in 7.2%, 13.8%, and 8.6% of patients in the single-dose, 0-4-hour, and 4-48-hour groups, respectively. In the 0-4-hour and 4-48-hour groups, additional exposure to ICM was not associated with AKI after adjusting for comorbidities and nephrotoxic drugs (all p values > 0.05).

3589,"Reduction of operator radiation dose by a pelvic lead shield during cardiac catheterization by radial access: Comparison with femoral access Objectives: This study sought to determine the efficacy of patient pelvic lead shielding for the reduction of operator radiation exposure during cardiac catheterization via the radial access in comparison with the femoral access. Background(s): Cardiac catheterization via the radial access is associated with significantly increased radiation dose to the patient and the operator. Improvements in radiation protection are needed to minimize this drawback. Pelvic lead shielding has the potential to reduce operator radiation dose. Method(s): We randomly assigned 210 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography by the same operator to a radial and femoral access with and without pelvic lead shielding of the patient. Operator radiation dose was measured by a radiation dosimeter attached to the outside breast pocket of the lead apron. Result(s): For radial access, operator dose decreased from 20.9 +/- 13.8 muSv to 9.0 +/- 5.4 muSv, p < 0.0001 with pelvic lead shielding. For femoral access, it decreased from 15.3 +/- 10.4 muSv to 2.9 +/- 2.7 muSv, p < 0.0001. Pelvic lead shielding significantly decreased the dose-area product-normalized operator dose (operator dose divided by the dose-area product) by the same amount for radial and femoral access (0.94 +/- 0.28 to 0.39 +/- 0.19 muSv x Gy-1 x cm-2 and 0.70 +/- 0.26 to 0.16 +/- 0.13 muSv x Gy-1 x cm-2, respectively). Conclusion(s): Pelvic lead shielding is highly effective in reducing operator radiation exposure for radial as well as femoral procedures. However, despite its use, radial access remains associated with a higher operator radiation dose. © 2012 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",Excluded
4430,"Pulmonary nodules: effect of adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) technique on performance of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system-comparison of performance between different-dose CT scans PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of ASIR on CAD system of pulmonary nodules using clinical routine-dose CT and lower-dose CT., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients (body mass index, 22.17 +/- 4.37 kg/m(2)) were scanned by multidetector-row CT with tube currents (clinical routine-dose CT, automatically adjusted mA; lower-dose CT, 10 mA) and X-ray voltage (120 kVp). Each 0.625-mm-thick image was reconstructed at 0%-, 50%-, and 100%-ASIR: 0%-ASIR is reconstructed using only the filtered back-projection algorithm (FBP), while 100%-ASIR is reconstructed using the maximum ASIR and 50%-ASIR implies a blending of 50% FBP and ASIR. CAD output was compared retrospectively with the results of the reference standard which was established using a consensus panel of three radiologists. Data were analyzed using Bonferroni/Dunn's method. Radiation dose was calculated by multiplying dose-length product by conversion coefficient of 0.021., RESULTS: The consensus panel found 265 non-calcified nodules <= 30 mm (ground-glass opacity [GGO], 103; part-solid, 34; and solid, 128). CAD sensitivity was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 71% (overall), 49% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 52% (overall), 67% (solid)] than at 0%-ASIR [clinical routine-dose CT, 54% (overall), 25% (GGO); lower-dose CT, 36% (overall), 50% (solid)] (p<0.001). Mean number of false-positive findings per examination was significantly higher at 100%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 8.5; lower-dose CT, 6.2) than at 0%-ASIR (clinical routine-dose CT, 4.6; lower-dose CT, 3.5; p<0.001). Effective doses were 10.77 +/- 3.41 mSv in clinical routine-dose CT and 2.67 +/- 0.17 mSv in lower-dose CT., CONCLUSION: CAD sensitivity at 100%-ASIR on lower-dose CT is almost equal to that at 0%-ASIR on clinical routine-dose CT. ASIR can increase CAD sensitivity despite increased false-positive findings. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3619,"Lung exposure from inhalation of radon progeny: Calculated from in vivo measurements of 210Pb in the skull To calculate the radiation dose to the lungs from the inhalation of radon and its short-lived progeny, an accurate estimate of cumulative exposure is necessary. In this preliminary study, the content of 210Pb in the skeleton is used to obtain a measure of integrated exposure to the lungs of people living in homes with above average concentrations of radon. Measurements of skeletal 210Pb made in vivo allow the exposed individuals to become, in effect, their own 'samplers' and 'dosimeters' through the normal physical and physiological processes of inhalation, deposition, and retention. 210Pb measurements have been made on 40 subjects whose homes have above average levels of radon. These data are used to obtain their cumulative lung exposures, defined as RLM (Respiratory Level Months). RLM is calculated from the numbers of atoms of RaA, RaB, and RaC,C' deposited in their respiratory systems over the time periods lived in the surveyed homes.

3633,"Quantitative impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry using a Beer-Lambert absorbance model It is well known that red blood cell scattering has an impact on whole blood oximetry as well as in vivo retinal oxygen saturation measurements. The goal of this study was to quantify the impact of small angle forward scatter on whole blood oximetry for scattering angles found in retinal oximetry light paths. Transmittance spectra of whole blood were measured in two different experimental setups: one that included small angle scatter in the transmitted signal and one that measured the transmitted signal only, at absorbance path lengths of 25, 50, 100, 250 and 500 microm. Oxygen saturation was determined by multiple linear regression in the 520-600 nm wavelength range and compared between path lengths and experimental setups. Mean calculated oxygen saturation differences between setups were greater than 10% at every absorbance path length. The deviations to the Beer-Lambert absorbance model had different spectral dependences between experimental setups, with the highest deviations found in the 520-540 nm range when scatter was added to the transmitted signal.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI examination of the most severely affected wrist was performed at both 0.25 T and 3 T. Three MRI-derived parameters, synovitis severity (RAMRIS grade), synovial volume (ml(3)) and synovial perfusion indices (maximum enhancement and enhancement slope), were compared., RESULTS: Comparing 0.25- and 3-T MRI, there was excellent agreement for semiquantitative assessment (r: 0.80, p < 0.00001) of synovitis (RAMRIS) as well as quantitative assessment (r: 0.94, p < 0.00001) of synovial volume. Good agreement for synovial Emax (r: 0.6, p = 0.002) and fair agreement (r: 0.5, p = 0.02) for synovial Eslope was found., CONCLUSIONS: Imaging of the RA wrist at 0.25 T yields excellent correlation with 3 T with regard to the synovitis activity score (RAMRIS) and synovial volume measurement. Fair to good correlation between low- (0.25-T) and high-field (3-T) MR systems was found for perfusion parameters, being better for Emax than for Eslope.",Excluded
4250,"Minimally invasive or open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as revision surgery for patients previously treated by open discectomy and decompression of the lumbar spine Minimally invasive lumbar fusion techniques have been developed in recent 20 years. The goals of these procedures are to reduce approach-related soft tissue injury, postoperative pain, and disability while allowing the surgery to be conducted in an effective manner. There have been no prospective clinical reports published on the comparison of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as revision surgery for patients previously treated by open discectomy and decompression or a traditional open approach. A prospective clinical study was performed by evaluating the clinical and radiographic results of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion as an alternative new technique in the revision surgery for patients previously treated by open procedure. 52 patients (28 M, 24 F) with an average age of 55.7 (31-76) were prospectively evaluated. All patients who had previous discectomy (n = 13), hemilaminectomy (n = 16), laminectomy (n = 12) and facetectomy (n = 11) underwent monosegmental and bisegmental minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MiTLIF) (n = 25) or open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (OTLIF) (n = 27) by two experienced surgeons at one hospital, from March 2006 to October 2008 (minimum 12-month follow-up). The following data were compared between the two groups: the clinical and radiographic results, operative time, blood loss, X-ray exposure time, postoperative back pain, and complications. Clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analogue scale and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). The operative time and clinical and radiographic results were basically identical in both groups. Comparing with the OTLIF group, the MiTLIF group had significantly less blood loss and less postoperative back pain at the second day postoperatively. The radiation time was significantly longer in the MiTLIF group. Complications included three cases of small dural tear in the MiTLIF group. There were five cases of dural tear and two cases of superficial wound infection in the OTLIF group. One case of nonunion was observed from each group. Minimally invasive TLIF is a safe and effective procedure for treatment of selected revision patients previously treated by open surgery with some potential advantages. However, this technique needs longer X-ray exposure time. © Springer-Verlag 2010.",Excluded
3540,"Outcomes and toxicity following Yttrium-90 radioembolization for hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors-a single-institution experience Background: The prognosis of patients with hepatic metastases from neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is generally good, and radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres is a locoregional therapy that is used in efforts to improve hepatic disease control and survival. This study aims to describe the survival outcomes and toxicities associated with radioembolization for hepatic-predominant metastatic NET in a large single-institution cohort. Method(s): A total of 59 patients underwent radioembolization for metastatic NET with hepatic predominant disease at a single academic center. Patient outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and toxicities were detailed and described. Ten patients within the cohort underwent post-treatment dosimetric analysis using PET-MRI and normal liver dosimetry was correlated with hepatic fibrosis and toxicity. Result(s): Median overall survival from time of radioembolization in the patient cohort was 31 months, and the 1- and 2-year overall survival was 80.4% and 65.6% respectively. Median hepatic progression-free survival and overall progression-free survival were 18 and 13 months, respectively. Three patients died of hepatic failure that was possibly therapy-related. Ten patients underwent evaluation of post-treatment dosimetry following radioembolization. In patients who did not develop hepatotoxicity or hepatic fibrosis, mean dose to normal liver was 25.4 Gy, while the mean liver dose in patients who experienced toxicity (hepatic fibrosis in n=2 and death from hepatic failure in n=1) was 59.1 Gy. Conclusion(s): Overall survival following radioembolization for hepatic metastases from NET is excellent; however, deaths that are potentially treatment-related have been observed. Preliminary data regarding dose to normal liver is suggestive of a relation between dosimetry and toxicity, however further work is required to further elucidate the mechanism, correlation with dosimetry, as well as additional patient and tumor factors that may predispose these patients to toxicity.Copyright © Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology.

4063,"UVB induces epidermal 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 activity in vivo Detrimental consequences of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in skin include photoageing, immunosuppression and photocarcinogenesis, processes also significantly regulated by local glucocorticoid (GC) availability. In man, the enzyme 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) generates the active GC cortisol from cortisone (or corticosterone from 11-dehydrocorticosterone in rodents). 11beta-HSD1 oxo-reductase activity requires the cofactor NADPH, generated by hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. We previously demonstrated increased 11beta-HSD1 levels in skin obtained from photoexposed versus photoprotected anatomical regions. However, the direct effect of UVR on 11beta-HSD1 expression remains to be elucidated. To investigate the cutaneous regulation of 11beta-HSD1 following UVR in vivo, the dorsal skin of female SKH1 mice was irradiated with 50, 100, 200 and 400 mJ/cm2 UVB. Measurement of transepidermal water loss, 11beta-HSD1 activity, mRNA/protein expression and histological studies was taken at 1, 3 and 7 days postexposure. 11beta-HSD1 and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression peaked 1 day postexposure to 400 mJ/cm2 UVB before subsequently declining (days 3 and 7). Corresponding increases in 11beta-HSD1 protein and enzyme activity were observed 3 days postexposure coinciding with reduced GC receptor mRNA expression. Immunofluorescence studies revealed 11beta-HSD1 localization to hyperproliferative epidermal keratinocytes in UVB-exposed skin. 11beta-HSD1 expression and activity were also induced by 200 and 100 (but not 50) mJ/cm2 UVB and correlated with increased transepidermal water loss (indicative of barrier disruption). UVB-induced 11beta-HSD1 activation represents a novel mechanism that may contribute to the regulation of cutaneous responses to UVR exposure.Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Concurrent gemcitabine (400 mg/m2/wk) in six weekly cycles starting on d 1 of radiotherapy (50.4 Gy; 1.8 Gy/fraction/d; 5 d/wk) was prescribed on 22 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients were analyzed with regard to radiological response on computerized tomography, overall survival, and toxicity. Twelve (55%) patients completed the prescription of six gemcitabine cycles and 50.4 Gy radiotherapy; while 10 (45%) received one to five cycles of gemcitabine owing to neutropenia. All patients experienced abdominal discomfort during treatment and three patients required medical intervention. Other toxicities reported were nausea in 13 patients (60%), grade 3 vomiting in 3 (14%). Radiological response evaluations were as follows: complete, 2 (9%); partial, 9 (41%); stable, 7 (32 %); and progressive, 4 (18 %). Median survival was 8.7 mo. Combination of weekly gemcitabine (400 mg/m2) and radiotherapy provided response in 50% of the patients but was associated with severe toxicity resulting in incomplete delivery of the planned chemotherapy. © Copyright 2007 by Humana Press Inc.

3514,"Multilocus inheritance determines predisposition to alpha-radiation induced bone tumourigenesis in mice In a recent study, we presented evidence for genetic predisposition governing radiation osteosarcomagenesis in mice. Following the incorporation of the bone-seeking alpha emitter 227Th, approximately 25% of the variance in osteosarcoma incidence was determined by inherited genetic factors. We have now mapped 5 susceptibility loci in crosses between the more susceptible BALB/c and the more resistant CBA/Ca strains. The major QTL on chromosome 14 overlaps with a locus that was already found in our previous study, using different strains of mice. Here, we investigate the effect by which the major susceptibility locus and 4 minor modifier loci interact to influence osteosarcoma predisposition. Following incorporation of the bone-seeking isotope, 100% of mice that harbour high-risk genotypes at all 5 susceptibility loci develop osteosarcoma with an average of 472 days latency times. In 10 mice inheriting exclusively low-risk genotypes only 1 osteosarcoma was found, arising after 733 days latency time. Inheritance of distinct combinations of BALB/c and CBA/Ca alleles at the susceptibility loci confer more extreme phenotypes in terms of susceptibility or resistance than observed in either of the two parental inbred strains. From the present study, we demonstrate that additive effects of multiple alleles, each making only a minor phenotypic contribution, can combine and significantly alter tumour risk. This mechanism can be of particular importance in genetically heterogeneous populations such as man. Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Included
3463,"Properties and evolutionary potential of newly induced tandem duplications in Drosophila melanogaster Most of some 33 X-ray-induced duplications recovered as Suppressors of Minute loci proved to be direct tandem duplications. When heterozygous, most duplications were crossover suppressors, and duplications of short to moderate size did not reduce the fitness of their bearers. Crossover suppression by tandem duplication may be attributed to intrastrand foldbacks of the type regularly seen in somatic polytene chromosomes. As a consequence, linkage disequilibrium between duplicated elements and normal chromosomes should be more profound than has been supposed. Tandem duplications appear to be predisposed by reason of frequency of generation, crossover suppression and fitness effects to serve as the primary source of new genes.",Excluded
3500,"Prognostic value of myocardium perfusion imaging with a new reconstruction algorithm Background: It has been demonstrated that a new reconstruction algorithm for myocardium perfusion imaging (MPI) allows faster acquisition with similar accuracy. The prognostic value of MPI performed with this software and short acquisition time is unknown. Method(s): To determine the prognostic value we followed 3184 consecutive MPI patients between March 2008 and March 2010. A 2-day protocol with low dose 99mTc-MIBI (10-12 mCi) and a 6-minute acquisition was used. Exercise stress was used in 62.6 % of the studies. Scans were reconstructed using the software ""Evolution for cardiac"". Perfusion defects were quantified by summed stress score (SSS) and categorized in four groups: SSS0 = 0; SSS1 = 1-3; SSS2 = 4-8; and SSS3 >= 9. Patients were phone contacted every 6 months for follow up and hard events were defined as death or myocardial infarction (MI) and total events as hard events plus late revascularization. Result(s): The mean radiation dose was <7 mSv/patient. Mean F/U was 33 +/- 20 months; 140 of the patients were lost to follow up and 86 were censored due early revascularization (<60 days after MPS). There were 140 hard events: 89 deaths and 51 MI. Mean age was 61.5 +/- 12.3 years and 57.7 % were male. Hard event rate was 0.8 %/year in patients with normal MPS and 3.7 %/year in those with abnormal MPS. Patients with larger defects had nine times more hard events than patients with SSS = 0 (14.2 % vs 1.6 %). Revascularization was more frequent in patients with abnormal MPS than normal MPS (21.7 % vs 3.9 %; P < 0.001). Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that SSS was an independent predictor of hard events and revascularization. Conclusion(s): The use of reduced-dose, fast myocardial perfusion SPECT and the new processing algorithm lowers acquisition time and radiation exposure compared to conventional SPECT without compromising the well-established prognostic value of MPI. © 2013 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded

Serum thyroid function tests before and after IMRT were regularly monitored. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out for predictors of biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism., RESULTS: In total, 149 patients were recruited. After a median follow-up duration of 3.1 years, 33 (22.1%) and 21 (14.1%) patients developed biochemical and clinical hypothyroidism, respectively. Eight (24.2%) patients who had biochemical hypothyroidism developed clinical hypothyroidism later. Univariable and multivariable analyses revealed that the volume of the thyroid (P=0.002, multivariable), VS60 (the absolute thyroid volume spared from 60 Gy or less) (P<0.001, multivariable) and VS45 (P<0.001, multivariable) of the thyroid were significant predictors of biochemical hypothyroidism. The freedom from biochemical hypothyroidism was longer for those whose VS60 >= 10 cm(3) (mean 90.9 versus 62.6 months; P<0.001) and VS45 >= 5 cm(3) (mean 91.9 versus 65.2 months; P=0.001). Similarly multivariable analyses revealed that VS60 (P=0.001) and VS45 (P=0.003) were significant predictors of clinical hypothyroidism. The freedom from clinical hypothyroidism was longer for those whose VS60 >= 10 cm(3) (91.5 versus 73.3 months; P=0.002) and VS45 >= 5 cm(3) (91.5 versus 75.9 months; P=0.007)., CONCLUSIONS: VS60 and VS45 of the thyroid should be considered important dose constraints against hypothyroidism without compromising target coverage during IMRT optimisation for NPC.

4556,"A useful intraoperative technique for transiliac-transsacral screws: a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus BACKGROUND: The transiliac-transsacral screw placement is a clinical challenge for surgeons. This study explored a point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw insertion and aimed to investigate the feasibility and accuracy of the guide apparatus in the treatment of posterior ring unstable pelvic fracture compared with a free-hand technique. METHOD(S): A retrospective study was performed to evaluate patients treated with transiliac-transsacral screws assisted by the point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus or free-hand technique. The intraoperative data of operative time and radiation exposure times were recorded. Postoperative radiographs and CT scans were performed to scrutinize the accuracy of screws position. The quality of the postoperative fracture reduction was assessed according to Matta radiology criteria. The pelvic function was assessed according to the Majeed scoring criteria at 6 months postoperatively. RESULT(S): From July 2017 to December 2019, a total of 38 patients were included in this study, 20 from the point-to-point guide apparatus group and 18 from the free-hand group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, injury causes, pelvic fracture type, screws level, and follow-up time (P > 0.05). The average operative time of the guide apparatus group for each screw was significantly less than that in the free-hand group (25.8 +/- 4.7 min vs 40.5 +/- 5.1, P < 0.001). The radiation exposure times were significantly lower in the guide apparatus group than that in the free-hand group (24.4 +/- 6.0 vs 51.6 +/- 8.4, P < 0.001). The intraosseous and juxtacortical rate of screw placement (100%) higher than in the free-hand group (94.4%). CONCLUSION(S): The point-to-point coaxial guide apparatus is feasible for assisting the transiliac-transsacral screw in the treatment of posterior unstable pelvic fractures. It has the advantages of simple operation, reasonable design and no need for expensive equipment, and provides an additional surgical strategy for the insertion of the transiliac-transsacral screw.",Excluded
4176,"Effects of gamma irradiation on mechanical properties of defatted trabecular bone allografts assessed by speed-of-sound measurement New sterilization methods for human bone allografts may lead to alterations in bone mechanical properties, which strongly influence short- and medium-term outcomes. In many sterilization procedures, bone allografts are subjected to gamma irradiation, usually with 25 KGy, after treatment and packaging. We used speed-of-sound (SOS) measurements to evaluate the effects of gamma irradiation on bone. All bone specimens were subjected to the same microbial inactivation procedure. They were then separated into three groups, of which one was treated and not irradiated and two were exposed to 10 and 25 KGy of gamma radiation, respectively. SOS was measured using high- and low-frequency ultrasound beams in each orthogonal direction. SOS and Young modulus were altered significantly in the three groups, compared to native untreated bone. Exposure to 10 or 25 KGy had no noticeable effect on the study variables. The impact of irradiation was small compared to the effects of physical or chemical defatting. Reducing the radiation dose used in everyday practice failed to improve graft mechanical properties in this study. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.",Included

The vast majority of the surveyed institutions are university hospitals. So far, data on 1,054 patients treated between 1985 and 2009 have been collected. The purpose of this study was to analyze RT and evaluate treatment outcome in these patients. Materials/Methods: Subjects of the survey were patients with histologically- proven PCNSL who received RT, including those who did not complete planned treatment. Clinical characteristics, treatment and prognosis of the patients were asked using a detailed questionnaire. Data on 466 patients seen between 1985 and 1994 were collected from 62 institutions, and 273 patients seen between 1995 and 2004 were collected from 30 institutions. Most recently, 315 patients seen between 2005 and 2009 were collected from 20 institutions. Thus, 1,054 patients (630 men and 424 women; median age, 62 years) were evaluable. No patients had AIDSrelated PCNSL. Among the patients, 696 were dead and 358 were alive or lost to follow-up. Median follow-up period for living patients was 37 months. Result(s): For all 1,054 patients, the median survival time (MST) was 24 months and the 5-year survival rate (5YSR) was 25.8%. The MST and 5YSR were 23 months and 24.8%, respectively, for 969 patients treated with whole-brain RT and 25.5 months and 29%, respectively, for 85 patients treated with partial-brain RT (p = 0.80). Patients were divided into 4 groups according to the total radiation dose: (1) 30-39.9 Gy; (2) 40- 49.9 Gy; (3) 50-53.9 Gy; and (4) >= 54 Gy. Patients receiving < 30 Gy were excluded. The MST and 5YSR were significantly better in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy than in the other groups (5YSR was 24%, 32%, 25%, and 21% for groups 1-4, respectively; all p < 0.05 against group 2 receiving 40-49.9 Gy). Even when the analysis was limited to patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and RT, the survival rate was similarly the best in the group receiving 40-49.9 Gy (5YSR was 41%, 51%, 37%, and 37% for groups 1-4, respectively). Patients receiving a whole-brain dose < 40 Gy had better survival than those receiving >= 40 Gy (5YSR: 32% vs 20%, p = 0.0005). For patients receiving high-dose methotrexate containing chemotherapy and partial brain RT (>= 30 Gy), the 5YSR was 51%. Conclusion(s): This large retrospective analysis suggests that the optimal total dose to the tumor may be in the range 40-49.9 Gy, even in combination with methotrexate-containing chemotherapy. Patients receiving partial-brain RT had a prognosis similar to those receiving while-brain RT. The whole-brain dose >= 40 Gy did not seem to be associated with better survival. Partial-brain RT with high-dose methotrexate may worth consideration for patients with a single PCNSL.",Excluded

Effective skin doses were evaluated using thermoluminescent finger dosimeters (ring dosimeters). The ratios of finger dosimeter exposure were compared between the glove-protected and unprotected left hands of two surgeons and both unprotected right hands. In addition, dose-area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy times were recorded in all patients. The mean treatment-effective dose to the surgeons' hands was 0.49 +/- 0.4 mSv in the glove-protected left hand and 1.81 +/- 1.31 mSv in the unprotected left hand (p < 0.05). The mean effective hand doses were 0.59 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the glove-protected surgeon and 0.62 +/- 0.55 mSv in the unprotected right hand of the control surgeon. The total corresponding fluoroscopy time was 38.55 minutes for the protected surgeon and 41.23 minutes for the unprotected one (p > 0.05).

Therefore, this antibody is promising for adjuvant conditioning radioimmunotherapy of bone marrow before bone marrow transplantation. To examine its potential use for radioimmunotherapy, we developed an efficient and reproducible technical protocol for labelling anti-NCA antigen antibody BW 250/183 with generator-produced rhenium-188, aiming at both high radiochemical yield and high specific activity. 188Re-labelled BW 250/183 antibody was used in 12 patients with advanced leukaemia. Labelling of BW 250/183 with 188Re was accomplished by the direct radiolabelling method using tris-(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine (TCEP) as the reducing agent. Twelve patients with recurrent acute or chronic leukaemia were treated with activities of 6.5-12.4 GBq of 188Re-labelled BW 250/183. Standard gamma camera scintigraphy was used to evaluate the biodistribution, and a region of interest analysis together with the MIRDOSE 3.1 software was applied to determine the radiation doses to relevant tissues. The 188Re-BW 250/183 antibody was labelled in high radiochemical yield, with high radiochemical purity (94% +/- 3%) and specific activity (5.55-7.4 GBq/mg) within 1 h. The preliminary biodistribution studies showed persistent uptake of 188Re-BW 250/183 in bone marrow. The radiation absorbed doses (mGy/MBq) delivered to the total body, red marrow, liver, spleen and kidneys were 0.13 +/- 0.02, 1.45 +/- 0.71, 0.43 +/- 0.21, 1.32 +/- 0.99 and 0.71 +/- 0.17, respectively.

4194,"Transition to radial approach for neurovascular procedures is safe and convenient: Characterization of a learning experience BACKGROUND: The transradial access for endovascular procedures has become a popular access point of preference for both patients and for many neuro-endovascular practitioners. OBJECTIVE(S): To describe a single-center experience on the transition to a radial-first approach for neurovascular procedures, focused on diagnostic angiographies, and to compare the differences in terms of length of procedure within the first 5 mo of its execution. METHOD(S): We performed a retrospective review of a prospective maintained cerebrovascular registry at an academic institution within the United States, to identify the expected adoption curve required to transition to a transradial route first approach focused mainly on diagnostic procedures. The 5 mo of experience were divided into 4 quartiles evenly distributed in time. The primary outcome was the total length of procedure. Secondary outcomes were access failure, radiation dose, the usefulness of ultrasound assistance and complications. RESULT(S): A total of 121 transradial procedures were performed: 113 diagnostic angiographies (93%) and 8 therapeutic interventions (7%). We identified 6 access failures (5%) and 1 complication (1%). The mean length for diagnostic angiographies was 24 +/- 10 min, and for therapeutic procedures was 58 +/- 19 min. A multivariate regression analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in the total length of procedures after the first quartile. CONCLUSION(S): The transradial route shows to be a safe and convenient approach. The total length of procedure starts decreasing as providers gain experience and become more confident with this route, as seen in our 5-mo experience.Copyright © 2020 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons",Excluded
3815,"Genetic susceptibility to thymic lymphomas and K-ras gene mutation in mice after exposure to X-rays and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea PURPOSE: Ras activation is one of the major mechanisms for the development of murine thymic lymphomas by radiation and chemical carcinogens. To gain insight into the relationship between genetic susceptibility and ras gene mutation, the frequency and spectrum of ras gene mutation was examined in thymic lymphomas from susceptible and resistant mice., MATERIALS AND METHODS: K- and N-ras mutations in thymic lymphomas that arose in X-ray-irradiated and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice of susceptible C57BL/6, rather resistant C3H and their hybrid B6C3F1 were analysed by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequencing., RESULTS: C57BL/6 exhibited a higher incidence of thymic lymphomas after exposure to X-rays and ENU than C3H, with B6C3F1 being intermediate. K-ras gene mutations occurred frequently in the pathogenesis of ENU-induced thymic lymphomas in susceptible C57BL/6 as opposed to resistant C3H. The ras mutations were more frequent in ENU-induced thymic lymphomas than X-ray-induced thymic lymphomas, and with the latter, there was no clear evidence for strain differences, suggesting that the genetic susceptibility to X-rays was independent of ras activation. The mutations of K-ras in thymic lymphomas from C57BL/6 were predominantly GGT to GAT in codon 12, whereas this mutation type was never found in those from C3H. No strain difference was observed in the nucleotide sequence or expression levels of O(6)-alkylguanine alkyltransferase, indicating that this enzyme did not account for the genetic susceptibility to ras activation., CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is a clear strain and carcinogen dependency of K-ras mutation and that the frequency of ras mutation might determine the genetic susceptibility to ENU-induced lymphomagenesis, whereas pathways independent of ras activation might determine the susceptibility to X-ray-induced lymphomagenesis.",Included
4138,"Cardiac and Renal Delayed Effects of Acute Radiation Exposure: Organ Differences in Vasculopathy, Inflammation, Senescence and Oxidative Balance We have previously shown significant pathology in the heart and kidney of murine hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) survivors of 8.7-9.0 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI). The goal of this study was to determine temporal relationships in the development of vasculopathy and the progression of renal and cardiovascular delayed effects of acute radiation exposure (DEARE) at TBI doses less than 9 Gy and to elucidate the potential roles of senescence, inflammation and oxidative stress. Our results show significant loss of endothelial cells in coronary arteries by 4 months post-TBI (8.53 or 8.72 Gy of gamma radiation). This loss precedes renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis and progresses to abnormalities in the arterial media and adventitia and loss of coronary arterioles. Major differences in radiation-induced pathobiology exist between the heart and kidney in terms of vasculopathy progression and also in indices of inflammation, senescence and oxidative imbalance. The results of this work suggest a need for different medical countermeasures for multiple targets in different organs and at various times after acute radiation injury to prevent the progression of DEARE.",Included
3597,"Developmental switch from LTD to LTP in low frequency-induced plasticity The stimulation of the Schaffer collateral/commissural fibers at low frequency (1 Hz) for 3-5 min can trigger a slow-onset form of low-frequency stimulation (LFS)-long-term potentiation (LTP) (LFS-LTP) in the CA1 area of the adult rat hippocampus. Here we have examined the developmental profile of this plasticity. In 9-15 day-old rats, the application of 1 Hz for 5 min induced long-term depression (LFS-LTD). In 17-21 day-old rats, 1 Hz stimulation had no effect when applied for 5 min but mediated LTD when stimulus duration was increased to 15 min. Over 25 day-old, 1 Hz stimulation mediated LFS-LTP. LFS-LTD was dependent on both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and mGlu5 receptor activation. Antagonists of mGlu1alpha and cannabinoid type 1 receptor were ineffective to block LTD induction. LFS-LTD was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting a postsynaptic locus of expression of this plasticity. Next, we examined whether LFS-LTD was related to 'chemical' LTDs obtained by the direct stimulation of mGlu5 and NMDA receptors. The saturation of LFS-LTD completely occluded NMDA- and (RS)-2-Chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG)-induced LTD. CHPG-LTD and NMDA-LTD occluded each other. In addition, we observed that NMDA-LTD was dependent on mGlu5 receptor activation in 9-12 day old rats while it was not in animals older than 15 day-old. Therefore we postulate that during LFS application, NMDA and mGlu5 receptor could interact to trigger LTD. Low-frequency-mediated synaptic plasticity is subject to a developmental switch from NMDA- and mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTD to mGlu5 receptor-dependent LTP with a transient period (17-21 day-old) during which LFS is ineffective.",Excluded
4563,"Analysis of acute radiation-induced esophagitis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients using the Lyman NTCP model PURPOSE: To analyze acute esophagitis (AE) in a Chinese population receiving 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combined or not with chemotherapy (CT), using the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 157 Chinese patients (pts) presented with NSCLC received 3DCRT: alone (34 pts) or combined with sequential CT (59 pts) (group 1) or with concomitant CT (64 pts) (group 2). Parameters (TD(50), n, and m) of the LKB NTCP model predicting for>grade 2 AE (RTOG grading) were identified using maximum likelihood analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses using a binary regression logistic model were performed to identify patient, tumor and dosimetric predictors of AE., RESULTS: Grade 2 or 3 AE occurred in 24% and 52% of pts in group 1 and 2, respectively (p<0.001). For the 93 group 1 pts, the fitted LKB model parameters were: m=0.15, n=0.29 and TD(50)=46 Gy. For the 64 group 2 pts, the parameters were: m=0.42, n=0.09 and TD(50)=36 Gy. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictors of AE were: NTCP (p<0.001) and V(50), as continuous variable (RR=1.03, p=0.03) or being more than a threshold value of 11% (RR=3.6, p=0.009)., CONCLUSIONS: A LKB NTCP model has been established to predict AE in a Chinese population, receiving thoracic RT, alone or combined with CT. The parameters of the models appear slightly different than the previous one described in Western countries, with a lower volume effect for Chinese patients. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3768,"Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment and Solar Radiation in Northwestern Spain OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) and solar radiation in northwestern Spain., METHODS: All RRD cases in Pontevedra from 2008 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Climatological data from 4 weather stations in the area were collected. The association between RRD incidence and solar radiation was investigated., RESULTS: A total of 256 RRD cases were identified. There was a seasonal variation in the incidence of RRD with a maximum number of incident cases observed in June and July and a minimum number of cases observed in January and December. An association was found between RRD incidence and solar radiation both monthly (p = 0.004) and bimonthly (p = 0.057). The right eye was more frequently affected than the left eye (p = 0.035). RD cases other than rhegmatogenous showed neither seasonality nor association with radiation., CONCLUSIONS: Solar radiation may play a role in RRD genesis in our area. Laterality could be related to the amount of radiation reaching each eye. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Excluded
4456,"Numerical simulation of pressure waves in the cochlea induced by a microwave pulse The pressure waves developing at the cochlea by the irradiation of the body with a plane wave microwave pulse are obtained by numerical simulation, employing a two-step finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm. First, the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution is obtained by solving the Maxwell equations on a FDTD grid. Second, the temperature rise due to this SAR distribution is used to formulate the thermoelastic equations of motion, which are discretized and solved by the FDTD method. The calculations are performed for anatomically based full body human models, as well as for a head model. The dependence of the pressure amplitude at the cochlea on the frequency, the direction of propagation, and the polarization of the incident electromagnetic radiation, as well as on the pulse width, was investigated.Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4293,"Efficacy of X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy on brain metastases and prognostic analysis Background and Objective: X-ray stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) is one of the effective treatments for brain metastases (BM). This study was to evaluate the efficacy of SRT on BM, and investigate prognostic factors. Method(s): Between July 1999 and December 2004, a total of 122 Intracranial lesions In 78 patients with BM were treated using SRT in our Center. Forty-nine patients had a solitary lesion and 29 had multiple (2-6) lesions. The median SRT dose was 15 Gy (11-24 Gy) in single fraction for 38 lesions, and 24 Gy (11-40 Gy) in 2-6 fractions for 84 lesions. SRT was combined with whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) of 30-40 Gy for 39 patients. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by the log-rank test and Cox model, respectively. Result(s): The median survival time was 12.9 months (1.7-77.4 months). The 1-year intracranial PFS rate was 87.4%. The 1- and 2-year OS rates were 53.9% and 25.8%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the 1-year OS rates were higher In the patients with pretreatment KPS of s= 70, extracranial lesions controlled, or SRT combined with WBRT than in those with KPS of < 70 (60.7% vs. 29.4%, P = 0.002), extracranial lesions uncontrolled (69% vs. 44.9%, P = 0.005), or SRT alone (64.1% vs. 43.4%, P = 0.03). The benefit of treating with WBRT in combination was mainly achieved in the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or with more than one Intracranial lesion. Multivariate analysis showed that KPS score and status of extracranial lesions were independent prognostic factors for OS. Conclusion(s): SRT is an effective and safe modality for BM. SRT combined with WBRT may prolong the survival time of the patients with extracranial lesions controlled or multiple Intracranial lesions. Independent prognostic factors for OS are KPS score and status of extracranial lesions.",Excluded

4133,"Radiation protection by the Ocimum flavonoids orientin and vicenin: Mechanisms of action In previous studies, flavonoids, orientin and vicenin, that were isolated from the leaf extract of Ocimum sanctum, were found to protect mice against radiation injury. Several flavonoids are known to be good antioxidants. Therefore, the effect of orientin and vicenin on radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in vivo and their antioxidant activity in vitro were studied. Adult mice were injected intraperitoneally with 50 mug/kg of orientin or vicenin and exposed whole-body to 3 Gy of gamma radiation. Lipid peroxidation was measured in the liver 15 min to 8 h postirradiation. The antioxidant activity of orientin/vicenin (10-500 muM) was studied by measuring inhibition of hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction (Fe3+-EDTA-ascorbic acid-H2O2) in vitro. The compounds were also tested for possible pro-oxidant and iron chelation activities at the above concentrations in the in vitro system. Orientin and vicenin provided almost equal protection against radiation-induced lipid peroxidation in mouse liver. Both compounds showed a significantly greater free radical-inhibiting activity in vitro than DMSO. Neither orientin nor vicenin showed any pro-oxidant activity at the concentrations tested. Both compounds inhibited free radical formation in the absence of EDTA. Free radical scavenging appears to be a likely mechanism of radiation protection by these flavonoids.

4267,"Ultraviolet-B induces ERCC6 repression in lens epithelium cells of age-related nuclear cataract through coordinated DNA hypermethylation and histone deacetylation Background: Ultraviolet-B (UVB) exposure attributes to the formation of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC), which is mediated with DNA damage. DNA damage, an important factor for pathogenesis of ARNC, is induced by UVB, and is generally resolved by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) repair mechanism. Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein coded by ERCC6 is a vital component for NER. However, we found no association between selected ERCC6 polymorphisms and ARNC. In this study, we investigated whether UVB exposure could alter ERCC6 expression and the process could involve epigenetic changes of DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation of ERCC6 in the lens epithelial cells (LECs). We also assessed the involvement of those coordinated changes in lens tissue from ARNC patients. Result(s): mRNA and protein expression of ERCC6 in lens tissue (LECs) were lower in ARNCs than those in the controls. This reduction corresponded to methylation of a CpG site at the ERCC6 promoter and histone modifications (methylation and acetylation) nearby this site. UVB-treated human lens epithelium B3 (HLE-B3) and 239T cell presented (1) increased apoptosis, suggesting reduced UV-damage repair, (2) hypermethylation of the CpG site located at position -441 (relative to transcription start site) within the binding region for transcriptional factor Sp1 in the ERCC6 promoter, (3) the enhancement of histone H3K9 deacetylation, (4) induction in DNA methyltransferases 3b (DNMT3b) and histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) associated to the CpG site of ERCC6 by CHIP assay. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest an orchestrated mechanism triggered by UVB radiation where the concurrent association of specific hypermethylation CpG site, H3K9 deacetylation of ERCC6, and repression of ERCC6 gene expression. Taken together, with the similar changes in the lens tissue from ARNC patients, our data unveiled a possible mechanism of epigenetic modification of DNA repair gene in the pathogenesis of ARNC.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
4429,"Impact of 2.45 GHz Microwave Irradiation on the Fruit Fly, Drosophila melanogaster The physiological and behavioral influences of 2.45 GHz microwaves on Drosophila melanogaster were examined. Standing waves transitioned into heat energy effectively when passing through the insect body. On the contrary, travelling waves did not transit into heat energy in the insect body. This indicated that there was no concern regarding the thermal effects of microwave irradiation for levels of daily usage. However, we detected genotoxicity and behavioral alterations associated with travelling wave irradiation, which can be attributed to the non-thermal effects of the waves. Electron spin resonance (ESR) revealed that fruit flies possessed paramagnetic substances in the body such as Fe3+, Cu2+, Mn2+, and organic radicals. The temperature dependent intensities of these paramagnetic substances indicated that females possessed more of the components susceptible to electromagnetic waves than males, and the behavioral tests supported the differences between the sexes.",Excluded
3756,"Blood supply to the oral and maxillofacial tissues following radiation therapy: a prospective ultrasonographic study In this prospective clinical study of the early radiation effects on blood supply to the mouth and face, 44 patients (31 men-13 women, mean age 63.4 yrs) with oral tumors underwent surgery and adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy with conventional fractionation (mean dose at the neck approximately equal to 50 Gy). Blood flow parameters 1 cm below the bifurcation of the common carotid artery (mean velocity time averaged, lumen diameter, resistivity index-RI) as well as perivascular reaction, were recorded on Color Doppler Imaging video tapes in a series of five consecutive examinations up to six months postirradiation. There were no statistically significant changes shown between the initial and follow-up examinations for any of the parameters investigated. There was no difference in blood flow between the ipsilateral (operated-irradiated) and contralateral side of the neck. Results did not seem to correlate with known vascular disease risk factors such as sex, arterial pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking and diabetes. After the effect of age was controlled, flow measurements remained statistically stable. Radiation dosage did not appear to influence carotid flow parameters. Perivascular reaction had the highest peak immediately postirradiation but regressed with time. This study suggests that therapeutic radiation of the neck at this dose level may not have important effects on the maxillofacial region blood supply for approximately eight months postoperatively; however, these patients should be closely evaluated for symptoms or signs of carotid artery lesions on a long-term basis.",Excluded
4303,"Cell Salvage During Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Retrospective Analysis of Tumor Recurrence Following Irradiation of the Salvaged Blood BACKGROUND: Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the treatment option for early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). OLT is often associated with high blood loss, requiring blood transfusion. Retransfusion of autologous blood is a key part of blood conservation. There are, however, concerns that the retransfusion of salvaged blood might cause the spread of cancer cells and induce metastasis. Irradiation of salvaged blood before retransfusion eliminates viable cancer cells. Here, we analyzed the incidence of tumor recurrence in patients with HCC undergoing OLT who received irradiated cell-salvaged blood during transplant surgery., METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients undergoing OLT for HCC between 2002 and 2018 at our center. We compared the tumour recurrence in patients who received no retransfusion of autologous blood with patients who received autologous blood with or without preceding irradiation of the blood., RESULTS: Fifty-one (40 male, 11 female) patients were included in the analysis; 10 patients developed tumor recurrence within a time period of 2.45 +/- 2.0 years. Statistical analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in tumor recurrence between patients who received autologous blood with or without irradiation., CONCLUSION: Intraoperative transfusion of cell-salvaged blood did not increase tumor recurrence rates. Cell salvage should be used in liver transplantation of HCC patients as part of a blood conservation strategy. The effect of blood irradiation on tumor recurrence could not be definitively evaluated.

3475,"Basal cell nevus syndrome with unusual associated findings: A case report with 17 years of follow-up Background: Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), also known as Gorlin-Goltz syndrome (GGS), is an inherit-ed autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the patched (PTCH) tumor-suppressor gene, which has high penetrance and variable phenotypic expressivity. In 1960, Gorlin and Goltz defined the condition by 3 main characteristics: multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), and skeletal anomalies. Nowadays, many neurologic, ophthalmic, endocrine, and genital manifestations are known to be associated with this syndrome. Considering the complexity of the clinical manifestations, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with NBCCS. Case Report: We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who presented with multiple maxillary and mandibular OKCs, as well as mandibular dentigerous cysts, all detected by X-ray. The medical records of the patient reported other findings such as falx cerebri calcification, osteolysis in femoral bones, and focal bone alteration suggestive of simple bone cysts. Based on the presented manifestations, it was concluded that the patient had characteristics of NBCCS. A multidisciplinary approach was necessary, and odontological intervention was used in man-aging treatment of the jaw cysts. Conclusion(s): In view of this combination of findings, it is of primary importance for dental surgeons and physicians to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of NBCCS in order to achieve an early diagnosis and avoid the progression of oral cysts, the metastasis of skin lesions, and progression of other less frequent manifestations.Copyright © Am J Case Rep, 2021;.",Excluded
3527,"Comparison of magnetic wire navigation with the conventional wire technique for percutaneous coronary intervention of chronic total occlusions: a randomised, controlled study Wire crossing of a chronic total coronary occlusion (CTO) is time consuming and limited by the amount of contrast agent and time of radiation exposure. Magnetic wire navigation (MWN) might accelerate wire crossing by maintaining a coaxial vessel orientation. This study compares MWN with the conventional approach for recanalization of CTOs. Forty symptomatic patients with CTO were randomised to MWN (n = 20) or conventional approach (n = 20) for antegrade crossing of the occlusion. In the intention-to-treat analysis, MWN showed a shorter crossing time (412 versus 1131 s; p = 0.001), and, consequently, lower usage of contrast agent (primary endpoint 42 versus 116 ml; p = 0.01), and lower radiation exposure (dose-area product: 29 versus 80 Gy*cm(2); p = 0.002) during wire crossing compared to the conventional approach. Accordingly, in the per-protocol analysis, the wire-crossing rate was, in trend, higher using the conventional approach (17 of 31) compared to MWN (9 of 28; p = 0.08). The use of MWN for revascularisation of CTOs is feasible and reduces crossing time, use of contrast agent, and radiation exposure. However, due to a broader selection of wires, the conventional approach enables wire crossing in cases failed by MWN and seems to be the more successful choice.",Excluded

The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the clinical outcomes of definitive chemoradiotherapy using carboplatin and paclitaxel. Medical records were reviewed of patients treated for nonmetastatic squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus between January 2009 and December 2013 in two collaborating institutes. Treatment consisted of external beam radiotherapy (28 fractions of 1.8 Gy) and 6 weekly courses of carboplatin (AUC = 2) and paclitaxel (50 mg/m2). Data on survival, progression, toxicity, and effect on dysphagia were recorded. Sixty-six patients were included. Median overall survival (OS) was 13.1 months (95% CI 4.7-21.5 months) and a 2-year OS was 30% (95% CI 18%-42%). At 2 years, 26% of patients developed local progression (95% CI 15%-37%) and 49% developed distant metastases (95% CI 36%-64%). Acute toxicity grade >=3 was observed in 47% of patients. Late adverse events grade >=3 were seen in 20%, mostly esophageal stenoses. Of patients with available data 3 months after treatment, 70% had relief of dysphagia. Definitive chemoradiotherapy led to a median OS of 13 months. Toxicity was common, mostly due to hematological toxicity. Given the relatively short median survival, an adequate selection of patients for this intensive treatment is required.Copyright © The Authors 2017.

Method(s): We determined the genotype and allele distributions of rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800470 (C869T), rs189037 (A-111G), and rs373759 (126713 G>A) in 141 Han Chinese patients who underwent definitive thoracic radiotherapy (50 to 77 Gy, 5 days/wk) for lung cancer (small cell or non-small cell tumors, n = 97), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, n = 27), or mediastinal cancer (n = 17). Clinical variables were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models to calculate the relative risk of RP associated with the clinical variables, and a Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the SNP genotypes and alleles and the incidence of RP for the various risk factors. Result(s): The T alleles of rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) and the G allele of rs189037 (GA/GG) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the ESCC patients (P = 0.0006, P = 0.0127, and P = 0.0412, respectively), and that the A alleles of rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) were associated with the risk of >= grade-2 RP in the patients with mediastinal cancer (P = 0.0063 and P = 0.0003, respectively). None of the SNP genotypes were associated with the risk of RP in lung cancer patients. Conclusion(s): The T alleles of the rs1800470 (CT/TT) and rs1800469 (CT/TT) SNPs of TGFbeta1 and the G allele of the rs189037 (GA/GG) SNP of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese ESCC patients, and the A alleles of the rs189037 (AG/AA) and rs373759 (AG/AA) SNPs of ATM are independent risk factors for RP in Chinese patients with mediastinal cancer. These SNPs might represent useful biomarkers for personalizing radiotherapy regimens for Chinese patients with ESCC or mediastinal cancer to reduce the incidence of RP. Large-cohort studies of these SNPs in thoracic cancer patients are warranted.Copyright © 2015, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.",Excluded

3804,"Subsequent cooling-circulation after radiofrequency and microwave ablation avoids secondary indirect damage induced by residual thermal energy PURPOSE We aimed to investigate the exact role of residual thermal energy following microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at the final ablation and transition zones and determine whether residual thermal energy could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation. METHODS In an ex vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed on fresh porcine liver, and central and border temperatures were compared. In an in vivo study, MWA and RFA were performed to the livers of New Zealand white rabbits. Tissue samples were stained with alpha-NADH-diaphorase. The coagulation zones (NADH-negative) and transition zones (lightly NADH-stained) of different groups were compared at different time points. RESULTS In the ex vivo model, the residual thermal energy after MWA and RFA could be dispersed by subsequent cooling-circulation due to the temperature decreasing rapidly. In the in vivo study, the coagulation volume in the ablation group was larger than that in the cooling-circulation group (P < 0.05) 2 days after ablation. In the ablation group, the damaged zone (the transition zone plus the coagulation zone) on alpha-NADH-diaphorase-stained images increased rapidly within 2 hours after ablation and slowly reached the maximum on day 2. However, the damaged zones did not change significantly at the three time points observed in the cooling-circulation group. CONCLUSION The residual thermal energy in MWA and RFA induced secondary damage beyond the direct coagulation zone, and it could be dissipated by subsequent cooling-circulation, contributing to smaller ablation and transition zones.Copyright © Turkish Society of Radiology 2019.",Excluded

Carboplatin (25 mg/m2) i.v. was given immediately before each morning thoracic radiotherapy. Blood samples were taken to measure the blood free platinum pharmacokinetics on day 1., RESULTS: All 31 patients completed the protocol treatment without delay. The median age was 73 years, and the majority had Stage IIIA (32%) or IIIB (48%) disease. Major acute toxicity (> or = Grade 3) included 17 patients (55%) with leukopenia, 5 patients (16%) with thrombocytopenia, and 7 patients (23%) with esophagitis. One possible treatment-related death due to diffuse pneumonitis was observed. There were three complete responses (CRs) and 23 partial responses (PRs) in the radiation field, for a response rate of 84%. The relapse pattern was predominantly loco-regional, and the median survival time was 9.8 months. The area under the plasma level-time curve (AUC) of free platinum correlated significantly (r = -0.41, p = 0.04) with the surviving fraction of leukocytes, but not with the severity of the esophagitis. Responders had significantly (p = 0.04 by Welch's t-test) higher AUCs than nonresponders., CONCLUSIONS: This combination therapy was feasible and efficacious against locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Although long-term local control still remains unsatisfactory, pharmacokinetic data are suggestive of a role for platinum in enhancing the radiation effect.",Excluded
3975,"Melanocortin 1 Receptor-Targeted alpha-Particle Therapy for Metastatic Uveal Melanoma New effective therapies are greatly needed for metastatic uveal melanoma, which has a very poor prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 y. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) is expressed in 94% of uveal melanoma metastases, and a MC1R-specific ligand (MC1RL) with high affinity and selectivity for MC1R was previously developed. Methods: The 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL conjugate was synthesized in high radiochemical yield and purity and was tested in vitro for biostability and for MC1R-specific cytotoxicity in uveal melanoma cells, and the lanthanum-DOTA-MC1RL analog was tested for binding affinity. Non-tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were tested for maximum tolerated dose and biodistribution. Severe combined immunodeficient mice bearing uveal melanoma tumors or engineered MC1R-positive and -negative tumors were studied for biodistribution and efficacy. Radiation dosimetry was calculated using mouse biodistribution data and blood clearance kinetics from Sprague-Dawley rat data. Results: High biostability, MC1R-specific cytotoxicity, and high binding affinity were observed. Limiting toxicities were not observed at even the highest administered activities. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies revealed rapid blood clearance (<15 min), renal and hepatobillary excretion, MC1R-specific tumor uptake, and minimal retention in other normal tissues. Radiation dosimetry calculations determined pharmacokinetics parameters and absorbed alpha-emission dosages from 225Ac and its daughters. Efficacy studies demonstrated significantly prolonged survival and decreased metastasis burden after a single administration of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL in treated mice relative to controls. Conclusion: These results suggest significant potential for the clinical translation of 225Ac-DOTA-MC1RL as a novel therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma.

No leakage between the obturator and surrounding tissue was observed, either for solids or for liquids. All of the prosthetic reconstructions were surprisingly stable during function. In the phonetic analysis, speech production was judged to be restored almost to normal. Videofluoroscopy may be valuable as a complement to other functional diagnostic procedures, and for the evaluation and improvement of rehabilitation with an obturator prosthesis.",Excluded
4265,"Regression models for near-infrared measurement of subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness Obesity is often associated with the risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and there is a need to measure subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) thickness for acquiring the distribution of body fat. The present study aimed to develop and evaluate different model-based methods for SAT thickness measurement using an SATmeter developed in our laboratory. Near-infrared signals backscattered from the body surfaces from 40 subjects at 20 body sites each were recorded. Linear regression (LR) and support vector regression (SVR) models were established to predict SAT thickness on different body sites. The measurement accuracy was evaluated by ultrasound, and compared with results from a mechanical skinfold caliper (MSC) and a body composition balance monitor (BCBM). The results showed that both LR- and SVR-based measurement produced better accuracy than MSC and BCBM. It was also concluded that by using regression models specifically designed for certain parts of human body, higher measurement accuracy could be achieved than using a general model for the whole body. Our results demonstrated that the SATmeter is a feasible method, which can be applied at home and in the community due to its portability and convenience.",Excluded
3860,"Knowledge and risk perception among nuclear power plant employees This is a study of knowledge, risk perception, and attitudes among nuclear power plant employees. A total of 236 persons participated, belonging to 10 different professional groups and working at two Swedish power plants. Job-related radiation risks were judged about average as compared to a number of other risks. On the whole, the participants in the study were satisfied with the measures of safety at work, but there were some exceptions to this rule, especially among those hired for temporary jobs through external contractors. The experience of job-related radiation risks was related to the level of knowledge about radiation and its risks: those who knew less experienced larger risks. General level of anxiety did not correlate with risk perception. The latter was accounted for mainly by perceived radiation risks. Job satisfaction was more strongly related to perceived conventional job risks than to nuclear risks. Risk ratings were related to how subjects defined the concept of risk. Those who stressed consequences as part of their risk definition gave higher risk ratings.",Excluded

Integrilin WRIST The Integrilin Washington Radiation for In-Stent Restenosis Trial (WRIST) aimed to study the impact of IIb/IIIa inhibitors as adjunct therapy to intracoronary radiation therapy (IRT) for patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR). The impact of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide) as adjunct therapy to vascular brachytherapy using (192)Ir emitter was examined in patients with in-stent restenosis. In the study, 150 patients were assigned to eptifibatide (Integrilin) and 150 patients to heparin only. Clinical composite endpoints at 30 days were similar between the patients treated with and without eptifibatide (4.7% vs. 4.0%; P = 0.78). There was a similarity in the non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) rates between the eptifibatide and the control group. Major bleeding was similar in patients treated with and without eptifibatide. Overall, the use of eptifibatide as adjunct therapy for patients with ISR that are treated with IRT did not impact the clinical outcome at 30 days. Copyright 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Excluded
3501,"Effectiveness and limitations of human identification from cremains: A report of two cases The present study of two case reports of the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake demonstrates the effectiveness and limitations of using dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging of cremains as a means of identification. In case 1, identification was assisted by further expanding the age range of the cremains evaluated on macroscopy by obtaining CBCT images of the cremated maxilla. The findings of case 2 presented the possibility that the deceased and the candidate were the same person by superimposing the CBCT images of the cremated patella on the X-ray of the candidate. However, since cremated bones are deformed to varying degrees, it is clear that the images obtained before, rather than after, cremation are more effective in comparing post-mortem and ante-mortem images. Thus, it is necessary to collect extensive and diverse data on the deceased before cremation.Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3564,"A Serum Small Molecule Biosignature of Radiation Exposure from Total Body Irradiated Patients The potential for radiological accidents and nuclear terrorism has increased the need for the development of new rapid biodosimetry methods. In addition, in a clinical setting the issue of an individual's radiosensitivity should be taken into consideration during radiotherapy. We utilized metabolomics and lipidomics to investigate changes of metabolites in serum samples following exposure to total body ionizing radiation in humans. Serum was collected prior to irradiation, at 3-8 h after a single dose of 1.25-2 Gy, and at 24 h with a total delivered dose of 2-3.75 Gy. Metabolomics revealed perturbations in glycerophosphocholine, phenylalanine, ubiquinone Q2, and oxalic acid. Alterations were observed in circulating levels of lipids from monoacylglycerol, triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylglycerol lipid classes. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were some of the most dysregulated lipids, with increased levels linked to proinflammatory processes. A targeted metabolomics approach for eicosanoids was also employed. The results showed a rapid response for proinflammatory eicosanoids, with a dampening of the signal at the later time point. Sex differences were observed in the markers from the untargeted approach but not the targeted method. The ability to identify and quantify small molecules in blood can therefore be utilized to monitor radiation exposure in human populations.",Included
4428,"Hepatocellular carcinoma in patients weighing 70 kg or less: Initial trial of compact-bolus dynamic CT with low-dose contrast material at 80 kVp OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic capability of hepatic dynamic CT with low-dose contrast material (420 mg I/kg body weight) at 80 kVp with that of the same modality performed with standard-dose contrast material at 120 kVp. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. We randomly assigned 111 patients (50 women, 61 men; mean age, 69.1 years) with known or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma and a body weight of 70 kg or less to one of two protocols. In the 80-kVp protocol, the contrast material (444 mg I/kg body weight) was delivered over 15 seconds at a tube voltage of 80 kVp. In the 120-kVp protocol, a contrast dose of 600 mg I/kg was delivered over 30 seconds at 120 kVp. Of the 111 patients, 38 had hypervascular hepatocellular carcinoma. Using the Mann-Whitney U test, we compared the two protocols for the contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors (difference between tumor attenuation and liver attenuation divided by noise in the liver) and the figure of merit (square of contrast-to-noise ratio divided by effective dose) of the tumors during the arterial phase of imaging. Effective doses also were compared. RESULTS. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the tumors was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (median, 5.3 vs 4.2; p = 0.04). The figure of merit also was significantly higher with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (10.2 vs 5.3, p = 0.02). The effective dose was significantly lower with the 80-kVp than with the 120-kVp protocol (2.97 vs 3.41 mSv, p < 0.01). CONCLUSION. With 80-kVp acquisition, the contrast-to-noise ratio and figure of merit of tumors during the arterial phase improved despite the lower contrast dose and radiation exposure. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
3799,"Phase 1 Fractional Dose-Escalation Study of Equipotent Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Regimens for Early-Stage Glottic Larynx Cancer PURPOSE: Early-stage glottic larynx squamous cell carcinoma (GLC) is a relatively common disease with excellent oncologic control, but treatment is associated with acute dysphagia and long-term voice quality changes. This phase 1 study of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage GLC increased the fraction size while reducing the number of fractions until 5-fraction stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR) was delivered., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Eligible patients had received a diagnosis of stage Tis to T2 GLC. Patients who had undergone prior curative-intent surgery were excluded. The equipotent dose levels were as follows: (1) level 0, 50 Gy in 15 fractions (n = 4); (2) level 1, 45 Gy in 10 fractions (n = 13); and (3) level 2, 42.5 Gy in 5 fractions (SABR level, n = 12). Grade 3 or 4 laryngeal edema, voice, dyspnea, stridor, or cough were the predefined dose-limiting toxicities., RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were enrolled from November 2013 to March 2017. The median and minimum follow-up times were 39.2 and 13 months, respectively. Two actively smoking patients, 1 treated in level 1 (grade 4 laryngeal edema, grade 3 dysphagia) and 1 treated in level 2 (grade 3 laryngeal necrosis, dysphagia), developed dose-limiting toxicities. The former patient soon developed a local recurrence, and the latter patient recovered. There were a total of 5 local recurrences: 2 in level 0 and 3 in level 1. The Voice Handicap Index results showed robust long-term voice quality with median values of 7 and 0 at 6 and 12 months, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Given the tolerability, excellent voice outcomes, and preliminary efficacy data of 5-fraction glottic larynx SABR, this regimen warrants further study.

3922,"Combined FET PET/MRI radiomics differentiates radiation injury from recurrent brain metastasis Background: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of combined textural feature analysis of contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) and static O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) PET for the differentiation between local recurrent brain metastasis and radiation injury since CE-MRI often remains inconclusive. Method(s): Fifty-two patients with new or progressive contrast-enhancing brain lesions on MRI after radiotherapy (predominantly stereotactic radiosurgery) of brain metastases were additionally investigated using FET PET. Based on histology (n = 19) or clinicoradiological follow-up (n = 33), local recurrent brain metastases were diagnosed in 21 patients (40%) and radiation injury in 31 patients (60%). Forty-two textural features were calculated on both unfiltered and filtered CE-MRI and summed FET PET images (20-40 min p.i.), using the software LIFEx. After feature selection, logistic regression models using a maximum of five features to avoid overfitting were calculated for each imaging modality separately and for the combined FET PET/MRI features. The resulting models were validated using cross-validation. Diagnostic accuracies were calculated for each imaging modality separately as well as for the combined model. Result(s): For the differentiation between radiation injury and recurrence of brain metastasis, textural features extracted from CE-MRI had a diagnostic accuracy of 81% (sensitivity, 67%; specificity, 90%). FET PET textural features revealed a slightly higher diagnostic accuracy of 83% (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 75%). However, the highest diagnostic accuracy was obtained when combining CE-MRI and FET PET features (accuracy, 89%; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 96%). Conclusion(s): Our findings suggest that combined FET PET/CE-MRI radiomics using textural feature analysis offers a great potential to contribute significantly to the management of patients with brain metastases.Copyright © 2018 The Authors",Excluded
4025,"Dual BET/kinase inhibitors as a novel strategy for the treatment of multiple myeloma The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of proteins are important epigenetic regulators of critical oncogenes, including c-Myc. JQ1 is the most potent BRD4 inhibitor, currently used in several clinical trials and effective in preventing multiple myeloma progression in vivo. Currently, clinical data is showing that patients often develop acquired resistance, indicating that single agent therapies targeting BRD4 such as JQ1 may not provide durable therapeutic responses. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a new class of dual inhibitors, capable to simultaneously target BRD4 and a panel of tyrosine kinases highly expressed in cancer including JAK2, FLT3, RET, FGFR1, ULK1 and ULK3. A preliminary in vitro screening identified SG3-014 as the lead compound, showing BRD4 and c-Myc inhibition activity similar to JQ1, but additionally, it is capable of inhibiting kinases that are over-activated in cancer and responsible for cytokine-mediated drug resistance pathways. In vitro assays on MM cell lines reveals higher SG3-014 sensitivity (5TGM1, 0.85muM; U266, 0.99muM) compared to JQ1 (5TGM1, 4.7muM; U266, 16muM). In vivo studies using 1x106 5TGM1-Luc cells demonstrate that SG3-014 treatment (25mg/Kg) significantly contributes to overall survival compared to JQ1 and the vehicle control cohort (n=10/group) (median survival CTRL=40.5; SG3-014=50.5; JQ1=46 days). Post-study analyses demonstrated a significant reduction in myeloma induced bone disease in the SG3-014 treated mice as measured by X-ray/muCT/histomorphometry. Clinical datasets identified ULK3 as the candidate kinase of SG3-014 targeting activity and correlated its expression with MM disease stages. Since ULK3 is involved in cellular senescence and autophagy regulation, a key mechanism by which several cancer cell lines protect themselves against apoptosis and become resistant to standard treatments, we explored the role of SG3-014 inhibition in the autophagy pathway. Preliminary data confirm that SG3-014 is an autophagy inhibitor and, as opposed to JQ1, downregulates ATG proteins level, leading to dysfunctional autophagosome formation. We noted that within 6 h, SG3-014 completely shut down autophagy with decrease levels of ULK1, beclin-1, ATG16L-1, ATG12, ATG3, p62 and increased LC3I/II ratios (additionally confirmed by microscopy and flow cytometry). These effects were not noted with JQ1. Further investigation is clarifying the mechanism by which SG3-014 inhibitory activity on ULK3 is responsible for autophagy mediated cancer cell death. In order to validate this target in the progression of the human disease, our future directions will analyze ex vivo multiple myeloma patient samples and examine the efficacy of the inhibitor in CD138 isolated multiple myeloma cells derived from patient biopsies. We propose dual BRD4/autophagy inhibition as a resilient strategy to prevent multiple myeloma by-pass of single targeted therapies.",Excluded
4538,"Reducing contrast medium dose with low photon energy images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of using low energy (keV) images in renal dual-energy spectral CT angiography (CTA) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) to reduce contrast medium dose. METHOD(S): 40 patients with renal CTA on a Discovery CT750HD were randomly divided into two groups: 20 cases (Group A) with 600mgI kg-1 and 20 cases (Group B) with 300mgI kg-1. The scan protocol for both groups was: dual-energy mode with mA selection for noise index of 10 HU, pitch 1.375:1, rotating speed 0.6s/r. Images were reconstructed at 0.625mm thickness with 40%ASIR, Group A used the conventional 70keV monochromatic images, and Group B used monochromatic images from 40 to 70 keV at 5 keV interval for analysis. The CT values and standard deviation (SD) values of the renal artery and erector spine in the plain and arterial phases were measured with the erector spine SD value representing image noise. The enhancement degree of the renal artery (DELTACT = CT(arterial) -CT(plain)), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=CTrenal-artery/SDrenal-artery) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR=(CTrenal-artery-CTerector spine)/SDerector-spine) were calculated. The single factor analysis of variance was used to analyze the difference of DELTACT, SNR and CNR among image groups with p < 0.05 being statistically significant. The subjective image scores of the groups were assessed blindly by two experienced physicians using a 5-point system and the score consistency was compared by the kappa test. RESULT(S): Contrast medium dose in the 300mgI kg-1 group was reduced by 50% compared with the 600mgI kg-1 group, while radiation dose was similar between the two groups. The subjective scores were 4.00 +/- 0.65, 4.50 +/- 0.60and 3.70 +/- 0.80 for images at 70 keV (600mgI kg-1 group), 40 keV (300mgI kg-1 group) and 45 keV (300mgI kg-1 group), respectively with good consistency between the two reviewers (p > 0.05). The 40 keV images in the 300mgI kg-1 group had similar DELTACT (469.77 +/- 86.95HU vs 398.54 +/- 73.68HU) and CNR (15.52 +/- 3.32 vs 18.78 +/- 6.71) values as the 70 keV images in the 600mgI kg-1) group but higher SNR values (30.19 +/- 4.41 vs 16.91 +/- 11.12, p < 0,05). CONCLUSION(S): Contrast dose may be reduced by 50% while maintaining image quality by using lower energy images combined with ASIR in renal dual-energy CTA. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Combined with ASIR and energy spectrum, can reduce the amount of contrast dose in renal CTA.",Excluded
3792,"Fast-neutron irradiation of glioblastoma multiforme. Neuropathological analysis Various modes of therapy, alone or in combination, have had little effect in improving the survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Recently, in a pilot study, 34 patients with glioblastoma were treated by fast-neutron-beam irradiation of the whole brain. Following treatment, the patients became steroid-dependent and pursued a gradual downhill course with increasing obtundation. Although there was no improvement in the length or quality of survival of these patients, neuropathological studies in the 13 patients who came to autopsy showed the following: 1) extensive coagulative necrosis of much of the tumor mass; 2) dense infiltration by collagenous connective tissue; 3) minimal phagocytic reaction; 4) marked reduction in the amount of viable tumor; 5) abnormal astrocytic proliferation, which may represent either astrocytoma or a radiation-induced bizarre gliosis, and 6) areas of gliosis and white matter degeneration in the brain stem, remote form the tumor site.

For assessment, wound measurement was done before, during and after treatment and wound healing time as well as lab tests like swab culture, X-ray of affected part, Hemoglobin, Total Leucocytes Count, Differential Leucocytes Count, Liver Function Test, blood sugar level and HbA1c were recorded. Patients with tubercular, malignant ulcers and with ulcers of less than 6 weeks duration were excluded from the study.

4124,"Intracranial Autograft Fat Placement to Separate the Optic Chiasm from Tumor to Improve Stereotactic Radiotherapy Dosimetry BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy for intracranial lesions is constrained by dose to neurologic organs at risk., CASE DESCRIPTION: We report 2 cases, a newly diagnosed chondrosarcoma and a previously irradiated meningioma, with tumors that abutted the optic chiasm following subtotal resection. Definitive radiotherapy would have required either undercoverage of the tumor or treatment of the chiasm with doses posing an unacceptable risk of blindness. Therefore, the patients underwent open surgery with placement of an abdominal fat autograft to provide space between the tumor and the optic structures at risk. Patients received definitive fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. For each patient, we retrospectively compared the treated plan (with fat autograft) to a second plan generated using the pre-autograft imaging, maintaining similar tumor coverage. For the chondrosarcoma, the fat autograft reduced the optic chiasm maximum dose by 21% (70.4 Gy to 55.3 Gy). For the reirradiated peri-optic meningioma, the optic chiasm maximum dose was reduced by 10% (50.8 Gy to 45.9 Gy), the left optic nerve by 17% (48.9 Gy to 40.4 Gy), and the right optic nerve by 30% (32.3 Gy to 22.6 Gy)., CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate the utility of abdominal fat autograft placement to maximize coverage of tumor while minimizing dose to intracranial organs at risk.

4275,"The role of autophagy regulator LC3B in thyroid cancer cells response to metabolic stress and radiation Decreased expression of the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B), a well-characterized regulator of autophagy, has been shown to be associated with metastatic progression in patients with thyroid cancer. We hypothesized that LC3B could play a role in the regulation of thyroid cancer cells response to radiation. Expression of LC3B was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot in FTC133, FTC236 and FTC238 cells. Stable LC3B-deficient cells were created by transfection with lentiviral particles containing LC3B specific shRNA. Thyroid cancer cell viability, proliferation, migration and apoptosis were analyzed in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells after exposure to gamma-radiation (6 Gy). Immunostaining with anti-LC3B was performed on tissue samples from 10 patients with anaplastic (ATCs) and 10 patients with papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs). LC3B expression was decreased in cell lines that derived from metastatic lesions (by 70% in FTC236 and by 90% in FTC238) as compared to FTC133 cells. Transfection with lentiviral particles inhibited LC3B mRNA level by 80% in FTC133 cells. LC3B silencing had no effect on cell cycle, did not inhibit thyroid cancer cells migration, and did not induce apoptosis. Glucose deprivation led to phosphorylation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. Induction of LC3BII and loss of p62 protein were detected in LC3B-expressing but not in LC3B-deficient cells. gamma-radiation induced gH2AX and caspase 3 cleavage in LC3B-expressing and LC3B-deficient cells. However, recovery of thyroid cancer cells after irradiation was more efficient in LC3B-deficient cells. Colony forming assay showed that survival fraction after gamma-radiation was higher in LC3B-deficient cells compared to LC3B-expressing cells (p = 0.01). Granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-LC3B was detected in 5/10 (50%) differentiated PTCs, but in 0/10 (0%) ATCs. LC3B is involved in thyroid cancer cell resistance to metabolic and oxidative stressors. Decreased LC3B expression in undifferentiated thyroid cancer suggests that defective autophagy can contribute to thyroid cancer cell resistance to therapy.",Excluded

Objective(s): To study the effects of ALA dose, incubation time, and lesion type on protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) production and treatment outcomes. Method(s): To examine the time course of PpIX production, 10% ALA was applied to inflammatory papules for 1 to 5 hours and followed by in situ fluorescence examination. To determine the effects of ALA dose and lesion type, 3, 5, and 10% ALA was applied to acne lesions in split-face fashion for 3 hours followed by whole-face light irradiation at 633 nm and 30 to 70 J/cm2. Treatment was repeated twice at 2-week intervals. Result(s): PpIX reached a stable level after 3 hours of incubation. Similar PpIX levels were seen in areas receiving 3, 5, and 10% ALA.

Method(s): The cases of 94 patients with stage I-II NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type in the upper aerodigestive tract who treated between May 2005 and Dec 2008 were reviewed. These patients received radiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy. Definitive radiotherapy was conducted using 3DCRT in 47 patients and IMRT in the other 47 patients with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy. Dosimetric pmeters of radiation treatment plans, local control probability (LCP), overall survival (OS), and toxicities were analyzed and compared between 3DCRT and IMRT. Result(s): From the dosimetric analysis, IMRT demonstrated significantly better dose coverage and homogeneity than 3DCRT. However, after a median follow-up of 46 months, IMRT was not associated with improvements in 4y-OS (80.9% for 3DCRT vs. 82.7% for IMRT, p=0.87) or 4y-LCP (86.3% for 3DCRT vs. 88.9% for IMR p=0.85). Of the 18 patients who received cervical lymph node irradiation, those in the IMRT group received a lower mean parotid dose. Furthermore, at-risk organs were strictly kept within the safe dose range in both groups, and no severe late toxicity was observed. Conclusion(s): IMRT provided better dose coverage than 3DCRT, although it failed to provide LCP and OS benefits. Definitive radiotherapy with a regional field and a total dose of 50 Gy is efficient and safe for NK/T-cell lymphoma using either IMRT or 3DCRT. However, IMRT may have the potential to reduce parotid gland hypofunction following cervical irradiation. © 2013 Shen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

Overall treatment time and total dose were equivalent., METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a prospective, nonrandomized study of T3, T4, and advanced T2 laryngeal cancer, concomitant boost schedules were used in 100 patients. Thirty patients received a schedule of twice daily 1.2 Gy in Weeks 1-3, followed by twice daily 1.7 Gy in Weeks 4 and 5; total dose was 70 Gy (the hyperfractionated accelerated schedule [HAS] regimen). Seventy patients were treated with 5 times 2 Gy in Weeks 1 and 2, followed by daily 1.8 Gy and 1.5 Gy (boost) in Weeks 3-5; total dose 69.5 Gy (the accelerated schedule only [ASO] regimen). Distribution of T stage was 47%, 40%, and 12% for T2, T3, and T4, respectively. In 24% of the patients, lymph nodes were positive. Pretreatment tracheotomy or stridor or both occurred in 8 patients. The distribution of prognostic factors was not significantly different between the two fractionation schedules. Acute and late toxicity was assessed. Results were estimated by the use of actuarial methods. For late toxicity and local control univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Tumor control probability analysis was used to model cure rate differences., RESULTS: Overall acute mucositis score was equal for both schedules. Acute mucositis started and decreased significantly earlier in the HAS regimen. In all patients acute mucositis healed completely. The treatment was completed within 38 days in all patients. The regional control rate was 100% for clinical N0, and 75% for the clinical N+ patients. The 3-year local control rate was 59% and 78% for the HAS and ASO regimens, respectively (p = 0.05); the ultimate local control was 80% and 94%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, besides the fractionation schedule (relative risk [RR], 2.6 for HAS vs. ASO), pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor (RR 4.3, yes vs. no), and local tumor response 3-6 weeks after radiotherapy (RR 5.1, no vs. yes) were independent factors for local control. Tumor control probability analysis indicated that the onset of repopulation may be about 4-6 days earlier for the HAS regimen. The onset of repopulation in the HAS regimen is probably at the end of the second week or at the beginning of the third week. Severe late toxicity was observed in the HAS group and ASO group in, respectively, 11% and 16%. In multivariate analysis this toxicity related significantly to the field size and pretreatment tracheotomy/stridor., CONCLUSIONS: In our study the timing of the boost in accelerated radiotherapy for advanced laryngeal cancer was an independent factor for local control, favoring the use of a concomitant boost in Week 3. This finding may indicate that accelerated repopulation of tumor cells starts early in the treatment phase.",Excluded
4305,"Corazonin- and PDF-immunoreactivities in the cephalic ganglia of termites Antisera against the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) and corazonin (Crz) reacted with distinct sets of neurons in the cephalic ganglia of termites. The locations of immunoreactive cells were similar but their numbers differed among the eight species examined: PDF-ir occurred in 0-6 cells in each optic lobe and 1-2 pairs of cells in the subosophageal ganglion (SOG), and Crz-ir in 0-2 pairs of cells in the pars intecerebralis, 3-14 cells in each lateral protocerebrum, and 0-6 pairs of cells in the SOG. Staining patterns were identical in the pseudergates, soldiers, and substitutive reproductives of Prorhinotermes simplex. Workers and soldiers were compared in the remaining 7 species. The only caste divergence was detected in Coptotermes formosanus, in which the soldiers differed from the workers by lack of 4 Crz-ir perikarya in the pars intercerebralis and occasionally also by the absence of 2 Crz-ir perikarya in the SOG. Diurnal changes in PDF-ir and Crz-ir were examined in P. simplex kept under long day (18:6 h light:darkness) or short day (10:14 h) photoperiods. No circadian fluctuations in the distribution or the intensity of immunostaining were found in the pseudergates and soldiers that were sacrificed in 4 h intervals or in the male and female substitutive reproductives examined in 6 h intervals. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

3775,"Radiation Dose Reduction in Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma We queried the National Cancer Data Base for stage I-II Hodgkin lymphoma patients and analyzed radiation dose in patients receiving combined modality therapy (CMT). We found a higher use of 20 Gy as a component of CMT after 2010, the year of publication of the GHSG HD10 trial results., Introduction: Treatment for early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) involves radiotherapy (RT), chemotherapy, or combined modality therapy (CMT). We analyzed reduction of RT dose in CMT, particularly in the context of German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) HD10 randomized trial results of 2010. Patients and Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with stage I-II HL receiving CMT. RT dose and associated characteristics were analyzed. Stage I and absence of B symptoms were used as a surrogate for early-stage favorable disease. Result(s): Of 31,301 patients with stage I-II HL, 11,457 received CMT between 2004 and 2015. Using the surrogate defined above, 1955 patients (17.1%) were classified as having favorable disease. The majority (61.6%) received 30-36 Gy, while 7.0% received 20 Gy. The provision of 20 Gy was more common in stage I patients (12.3% vs. 5.4% in stage II) and at academic facilities (10.8% vs. 6.3%-8.9% at other facilities). Use of 20 Gy (vs. 30-36 Gy) was less likely with thorax site (odds ratio [OR] 0.43 vs. head and neck), stage II disease (OR 0.41), and B symptoms (OR 0.33). Notably, the use of 20 Gy increased dramatically after 2010 (the year of publication of GHSG HD10 trial results), with rates of 12.3% in 2010-2015 versus 0.1% in 2004-2009 (OR 6.3, P <.001). This was even more pronounced in cases of favorable early-stage disease, with 25.5% after 2010 versus 2.8% before 2010 (OR 13.2, P <.001). The use of doses > 36 Gy decreased over a corresponding time period (OR 0.44, P <.001). Conclusion(s): Analysis of CMT for patients with early-stage HL demonstrates variability in RT dose, including increasing use of 20 Gy and decreasing use of high doses > 36 Gy.Copyright © 2020",Excluded
3349,"Brugia malayi: effects of gamma radiation on adult worms and their intracellular Wolbachia bacteria Prior studies have shown that intracellular Wolbachia endobacteria are necessary for the normal development, reproduction, and survival of filarial nematodes. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of gamma radiation on Wolbachia and reproduction in Brugia malayi adult worms. Worms were exposed to 0, 10, 25, 45, 75, and 105 krad of gamma radiation from a 137cesium source and cultured in vitro for 10 days. Irradiation reduced production of microfilariae in a dose-dependent manner. Embryograms of irradiated female worms showed dose-related abnormalities with arrested development at the early embryo stage. Irradiation reduced the viability of adult worms in a dose-dependent manner, but no lethal effect was observed. Electron microscopy studies showed that irradiation cleared Wolbachia from worm tissues. Real-time polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrated greatly reduced Wolbachia DNA in irradiated worms. These effects are essentially the same as those observed in adult worms treated with doxycycline. These studies suggest that effects of irradiation on reproduction in Brugia malayi may be caused by effects of irradiation on Wolbachia.",Included
3452,"Good genes and the maternal effects of polyandry on offspring reproductive success in the bulb mite Genetic benefits are potentially the most robust explanation of the controversial issue of evolutionary maintenance of polyandry, but the unambiguous demonstration of such benefits has been hindered by the possibility of their confusion with maternal effects. Previous research has shown that polyandrous bulb mite females produce daughters with higher fecundity than monandrous females. Here, we investigate whether this effect arises because polyandrous females invest more in their offspring, or because their offspring inherit 'good genes' from their fathers. Females were mated with either one or four (different) males. However, by sterilizing three of the four males with ionizing radiation, we eliminated any chance of sexual selection (in the polyandrous treatment) so that any differences in the female mating regimes must have been owing to maternal effects. Polyandry had no significant effect on daughter fecundity, thus indicating that any previously documented effects must have been genetic. This was further supported by a significant association between fathers' offensive sperm-competitive ability and the fecundity of their daughters. The association with fathers' sperm defensive ability was not significant, and neither was the association between fathers' sperm competitiveness and sons' reproductive success. However, sons of polyandrous females had lower reproductive success than sons of monandrous females. This shows that the maternal effects of polyandry should be taken into account whenever its costs and benefits are being considered.",Excluded
3987,"Proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy for locally advanced tongue cancer Background: The standard treatment for locally advanced tongue cancer is surgery. However, the patient's quality of life is lost. As a newly non-operative treatment, we report the efficacy and toxicity of proton beam therapy combined with selective intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (PBT-IACT) for locally advanced tongue cancer. Method(s): Between February 2009 and August 2012, 45 cases of stage III-IV(M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (28 men and 17 women) were treated by PBT-IACT at Southern TOHOKU Proton Therapy Center. Median age was 58 years (range:24-83 years), and clinical stage III/IVA/IVB were 11/32/2 respectively. In case of surgery, the patients required subtotal or total resection of the tongue. Initially, 2 courses of systemic chemotherapy and prophyractic whole neck irradiation (36Gy/20fr.) were performed. Subsequently, for gross tumor targets, PBT (33Gy/15fr.) and IACT were administered via the superficial temporal artery by continuous infusion of cisplatin with sodium thiosulphate. For PBT, 1 or 2 portals of 210 MeV proton beam were arranged in optimal angles to avoid overdosing the risk organ. Systemic chemotherapy was performed only for age of 70 years or younger. Result(s): The median follow-up was 27 months (range:8-48 months). Over all survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and local control (LC) rates at 2 years were 88%,78%, 80%, respectively. LC of cervical lymph node metastases at 2 years was 86%. As the early toxic event, grade 3 mucositis (32/45) and blood/bone marrow toxicity (22/45) were observed. Within 6 months after this therapy, mandibular osteomyelitis occurred in 1 case. Conclusion(s): PBT-IACT appeared to be safe and has a good LC rate for locally advanced tongue cancer. Furthermore, it is not inferior to surgery and can be one of the new effective treatment options for locally advanced tongue cancer.",Excluded
4241,"Functional dosimetric metrics for predicting radiation-induced lung injury in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is an important dose-limiting toxicity during thoracic radiotherapy. The purpose of this study is to investigate single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion-weighted functional dose-volume histogram (FDVH) for predicting RILI in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. Method(s): Fifty-seven locally advanced NSCLC patients receiving chemoradiotherapy were enrolled prospectively. Patients had treatment scans and dose calculations to provide a standard dose-volume histogram (DVH). Fusion of SPECT and computed tomography scans provided perfusion-weighted FDVH and associated functional dosimetric parameters (relative volumes of functional lung receiving more than a threshold dose of 5 - 60 Gy at increments of 5 Gy [FV5 - FV60]). The predictive abilities of FDVH and DVH were calculated and compared based on the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Result(s): The accumulative incidence of >= 2 grade RILI was 19.3% with a median follow-up of 12 months. Univariate analysis showed that the functional (FV5 - FV60) and standard (V5 - V40) parameters were associated with RILI (all value of p < 0.05). Close correlations between a variety of functional and standard parameters were found. By ROC curve analysis, functional metrics (AUCs were 0.784 - 0.869) provided similarly (p value 0.233 - 1.000) predictive outcome to standard metrics (AUCs were 0.695 - 0.902) in lower - median dose level parameters (FV5 - FV40). However, FDVH seemed to add some predictive value in higher dose level, the best statistical significance for comparing FV60 with V60 was 0.693 vs. 0.511 (p = 0.055). Conclusion(s): Functional metrics are identified as reliable predictors for RILI, however, this observation still needs to be further verified using a larger sample size. © 2012 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded
4518,"Effectiveness of postoperative radiotherapy on atypical meningioma patients: A population-based study Purpose: It is controversial whether atypical meningioma patients undergoing gross-total resection (GTR) can benefit from postoperative radiotherapy (PORT). This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of PORT on atypical meningioma patients. Method(s): Patients diagnosed with atypical meningioma from 2008 to 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated, and the log-rank test was used to compare the differences among groups. Univariable and multivariable COX regressions were conducted for survival analyses. Result(s): A total of 1,014 patients were enrolled. The 5-years survival rate of the overall patients was 79.0%. PORT was performed in 315 (31.1%) patients. The utilization rates of PORT in patients undergoing GTR and undergoing subtotal resection (STR) were 26.7% and 42.2%, respectively. For patients undergoing STR, log-rank test showed that overall survival (OS) time was significantly longer in patients receiving PORT than those not (p = 0.026). For patients undergoing GTR, OS time did not show significant association with PORT (p = 0.339). In addition, patients undergoing STR with PORT had no significantly different OS time compared with those undergoing GTR with PORT (p = 0.398). Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that receipt of PORT (p = 0.187) was not an independent predictor of OS after adjustment. Conclusion(s): PORT may not prolong the OS in atypical meningioma patients undergoing GTR. However, patients undergoing STR may benefit from PORT and achieve similar OS to those undergoing GTR.Copyright © 2019 Zeng, Shi and Guo.",Excluded
3862,"Radiation-free weekend rescued! Continuous accelerated irradiation of 7-days per week is equal to accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost of 7 fractions in 5-days per week: Report on phase 3 clinical trial in head-and-neck cancer patients Purpose: To report long-term results of randomized trial comparing 2 accelerated fractionations of definitive radiation therapy assessing the need to irradiate during weekend in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Methods and Materials: A total of 345 patients with SCC of the oral cavity, larynx, and oro- or hypo-pharynx, stage T2-4N0-1M0, were randomized to receive continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR: once per day, 7 days per week) or concomitant accelerated boost (CB: once per day, 3 days per week, and twice per day, 2 days per week). Total dose ranged from 66.6-72 Gy, dose per fraction was 1.8 Gy, number of fractions ranged from 37-40 fractions, and overall treatment time ranged from 37-40 days. Result(s): No differences for all trial end-points were noted. At 5 and 10 years, the actuarial rates of local-regional control were 63% and 60% for CAIR vs 65% and 60% for CB, and the corresponding overall survival were 40% and 25% vs 44% and 25%, respectively. Confluent mucositis was the main acute toxicity, with an incidence of 89% in CAIR and 86% in CB patients. The 5-year rate of grade 3-4 late radiation morbidity was 6% for both regimens. Conclusion(s): Results of this trial indicate that the effects of accelerated fractionation can be achieve by delivering twice-per-day irradiation on weekday(s). This trial has also confirmed that an accelerated, 6-weeks schedule is a reasonable option for patients with intermediate-stage head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma because of the associated high cure rate and minimal severe late toxicity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

4208,"Dosimetric implications of the addition of 18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography in CT-based radiotherapy planning for non-small-cell lung cancer Summary The aim of this study was to assess the impact of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) CT on radiotherapy planning parameters for patients treated curatively with radiotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Five patients with stages I-III NSCLC underwent a diagnostic FDG-PET CT (dPET CT), planning FDG-PET CT (pPET CT) and a simulation CT (RTP CT). For each patient, three radiation oncologists delineated a gross tumour volume based on RTP CT alone, and fused with dPET CT and pPET CT. Standard expansions were used to generate PTVs, and a 3D conformal plan was created. Normal tissue doses were compared between plans. Coverage of pPET CT PTV by the plans based on RTP CT and dPET CT was assessed, and tumour control probabilities were calculated. Mean PTV was similar between RTP CT, dPET CT and pPET CT, although there were significant inter-observer differences in four patients. The plans, however, showed no significant differences in doses to lung, oesophagus, heart or spinal cord. The RTP CT plan and dPET CT plan significantly underdosed the pPET PTV in two patients with minimum doses ranging from 12 to 63% of prescribed dose. Coverage by the 95% isodose was suboptimal in these patients, but this did not translate into poorer tumour control probability. The effect of fused FDG-PET varied between observers. The addition of dPET and pPET did not significantly change the radiotherapy planning parameters. Although FDG-PET is of benefit in tumour delineation, its effect on normal tissue complication probability and tumour control probability cannot be predicted.",Excluded
4312,"Pre-apoptotic response to therapeutic DNA damage involves protein modulation of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3 in acute myeloid leukemia cells BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are characterized by non-mutated TP53, high levels of Hdm2, and frequent mutation of the Flt3 receptor tyrosine kinase. The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis., RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis., CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.",Excluded

From the Adult Health Study (AHS) population of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, 2052 men and women aged 60 or over and living in Hiroshima were evaluated for their cognitive functions using the CASI. Dementia was diagnosed in 93 and 1,959 were considered not to suffer from dementia based on the DSM-III-R criteria using neurological examination and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) completed by caregivers. Multivariate regression analysis not only indicated that total score was higher with lower age and higher education but that the slope of its decrease is steeper with higher age and fewer years of education. The slope of score decrease with increase of age was steeper for women than for men. Furthermore, CASI items were categorized by domains of cognitive function. Multivariate regression analysis for each cognitive domain showed clear effects of age and level of education. The effect of age for the nondementia subjects was large in cognitive domains dealing with temporal orientation, short-term memory, and list-generating fluency.

3907,"Observer variation in target volume delineation of lung cancer related to radiation oncologist-computer interaction: a 'Big Brother' evaluation BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the process of target volume delineation in lung cancer for optimization of imaging, delineation protocol and delineation software., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven radiation oncologists (observers) from five different institutions delineated the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) including positive lymph nodes of 22 lung cancer patients (stages I-IIIB) on CT only. All radiation oncologist-computer interactions were recorded with a tool called 'Big Brother'. For each radiation oncologist and patient the following issues were analyzed: delineation time, number of delineated points and corrections, zoom levels, level and window (L/W) settings, CT slice changes, use of side windows (coronal and sagittal) and software button use., RESULTS: The mean delineation time per GTV was 16 min (SD 10 min). The mean delineation time for lymph node positive patients was on average 3 min larger (P = 0.02) than for lymph node negative patients. Many corrections (55%) were due to L/W change (e.g. delineating in mediastinum L/W and then correcting in lung L/W). For the lymph node region, a relatively large number of corrections was found (3.7 corr/cm2), indicating that it was difficult to delineate lymph nodes. For the tumor-atelectasis region, a relative small number of corrections was found (1.0 corr/cm2), indicating that including or excluding atelectasis into the GTV was a clinical decision. Inappropriate use of L/W settings was frequently found (e.g. 46% of all delineated points in the tumor-lung region were delineated in mediastinum L/W settings). Despite a large observer variation in cranial and caudal direction of 0.72 cm (1 SD), the coronal and sagittal side windows were not used in 45 and 60% of the cases, respectively. For the more difficult cases, observer variation was smaller when the coronal and sagittal side windows were used., CONCLUSIONS: With the 'Big Brother' tool a method was developed to trace the delineation process. The differences between observers concerning the delineation style were large. This study led to recommendations on how to improve delineation accuracy by adapting the delineation protocol (guidelines for L/W use) and delineation software (double window with lung and mediastinum L/W settings at the same time, enforced use of coronal and sagittal views) and including FDG-PET information (lymph nodes and atelectasis).",Excluded

The potential advantages of preoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer include pathological downstaging and reduced toxicity. Capecitabine and fluorouracil showed similar efficacy in preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. Capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin demonstrated efficacy for advanced colorectal cancer treatment. Methods. We conducted a phase 2 study to determine the efficacy and safety of preoperative concurrent CAPOX radiotherapy in Thai patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Capecitabine 1650mg/m2 per day was taken on days 1-14 and 22-35 of radiotherapy. Oxaliplatin 50mg/m2 was administered on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of radiotherapy. The radiation dose to the pelvis was 45 Gy/25 fractions with a boost dose of 5.4 Gy/3 fractions. The total dose to the tumour bed was 50.4 Gy/28 fractions. Clinical response was evaluated by MRI prior to surgery. Patients underwent surgery 4-6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The endpoints of this study were clinical response, pathological response, and toxicities. Results. Twenty patients have been enrolled. Median age was 59.5 years (range 37-72). Male:female ratio was 1.22:1. All patients had clinical T3 N positive disease except one who hadT4 disease. After receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy, severe toxicities (diarrhoea, fatigue, anorexia,and neuropathy) were found in four patients (20%). One patient refused surgery after preoperative treatment. Response rate was evaluated in 18 patients. Clinical response rate was 83.4% (cCR 55.6%). Pathological response rate was 70.6% (pCR 5.9%).

3574,"Limitations of body surface area-based activity calculation for radioembolization of hepatic metastases in colorectal cancer PURPOSE: To calculate absorbed radiation doses in patients treated with resin microspheres prescribed by the body surface area (BSA) method and to analyze dose-response and toxicity relationships., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of 45 patients with colorectal carcinoma metastases who received single-session whole-liver resin microsphere radioembolization. Prescribed treatment activity was calculated using the BSA method. Liver volumes and whole-liver absorbed doses (D(WL)) were calculated. D(WL) was correlated with toxicity and radiographic and biochemical response., RESULTS: The standard BSA-based administered activity (range, 0.85-2.58 GBq) did not correlate with D(WL) (mean, 50.4 Gy; range, 29.8-74.7 Gy; r = -0.037; P = .809) because liver weight was highly variable (mean, 1.89 kg; range, 0.94-3.42 kg) and strongly correlated with D(WL) (r = -0.724; P < .001) but was not accounted for in the BSA method. Patients with larger livers were relatively underdosed, and patients with smaller livers were relatively overdosed. Patients who received D(WL) > 50 Gy experienced more toxicity and adverse events (> grade 2 liver toxicity, 46% vs 17%; P < .05) but also responded better to the treatment than patients who received D(WL)< 50 Gy (disease control, 88% vs 24%; P < .01)., CONCLUSIONS: Using the standard BSA formula, the administered activity did not correlate with D(WL). Based on this short-term follow-up after salvage therapy in patients with late stage metastatic colorectal carcinoma, dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships support using a protocol based on liver volume rather than BSA to prescribe the administered activity.

3606,"[Characteristics of postural corrective responses before and after long-term spaceflight] Balance function is dramatically deteriorated after exposure to microgravity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role and the contribution of different gravity sensory systems to the development of balance impairment after long-term spaceflights. Postural perturbations (pushes to the chest) of the threshold, medium, and sub-maximal intensities were produced in eight cosmonauts before, and on the day 3, 7, and 11 following spaceflight. Postural corrective responses were analyzed by anterior-posterior body sway fluctuation and electromyographic activity of leg muscles. The characteristics of the postural corrective responses changed significantly on the day 3 following spaceflight: the amplitude of posterior sway caused by perturbation of threshold intensity was increased reaching 135% ofpreflight value; the corrective responses lasted more than 6 s in 50% of all trials, while it did not last more than 4 s in 96% before spaceflight. The EMG responses were characterized by increased contribution of medium- and long-latency reactions. On the day 11 following spaceflight, most of the characteristics of postural corrective responses were close to preflight values. We assumed that the balance alterations after spaceflight are caused by changes in weightlessness of functions of two main gravity sensory systems, namely, weight-bearing and vestibular one. The deficit of weight-bearing afferentation triggers a decline of the extensors' muscle tone, while changes of vestibular function cause a decline of accuracy of postural corrections.",Excluded

At the final visit, 3 eyes (71.4%) showed reduction in the central subfield thickness (CST; mean reduction of 17.6%, range 9-149 microm) with improvement in BCVA, whilst 2 eyes worsened in terms of CST and final BCVA. Another 2 eyes remained altered in BCVA despite slight improvement in CST., CONCLUSION: The use of intravitreal bevacizumab in this group of patients showed variable response in terms of CST and BCVA outcome but remains a viable option to treat this challenging condition.

3706,"Renal denervation for refractory hypertension - technical aspects, complications and radiation exposure PURPOSE: To analyze procedural details, complications and radiation exposure in renal denervation (RDN) using the Medtronic Symplicity R device in the treatment of refractory hypertension., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty three consecutive patients underwent RDN. The number of ablations per artery, peri-procedural complications, procedure time (PT), fluoroscopy time (FT), dose-area product (DAP) and procedure-related complications were documented. Additionally, the radiation dose was compared between obese (body mass index >= 30 kg/m(2)) and non-obese patients., RESULTS: Bilateral RDN was performed in 50/53 (94 %) cases and with a minimum of 4 ablations per artery in 33/50 (66 %), the mean count being 5.4 (range R: 2 - 13) on the right and 4.3 (R: 1 - 10) on the left. The FT and DAP decreased significantly over the first 12 procedures, reaching a steady state with a median FT of 11.2 min (R: 7.5 - 27) and a median DAP of 4796 cGy x cm(2) (R: 1076 - 21 371), resulting in an effective dose of 15.7 mSv. The median PT was 57 min (R: 40 - 70). Obese patients had a 3.3-fold higher radiation dose (p < 0.001). We observed one severe spasm and one imminent respiratory depression, both resolved without sequelae., CONCLUSION: For an experienced interventionalist, RDN has a short learning curve with a low risk profile. The radiation dose does not exceed that of other renal artery interventions, but is explicitly higher in obese patients, who account for a large portion of patients with refractory hypertension.

4098,"No effects of a single 3G UMTS mobile phone exposure on spontaneous EEG activity, ERP correlates, and automatic deviance detection Potential effects of a 30 min exposure to third generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) mobile phone-like electromagnetic fields (EMFs) were investigated on human brain electrical activity in two experiments. In the first experiment, spontaneous electroencephalography (sEEG) was analyzed (n = 17); in the second experiment, auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) and automatic deviance detection processes reflected by mismatch negativity (MMN) were investigated in a passive oddball paradigm (n = 26). Both sEEG and ERP experiments followed a double-blind protocol where subjects were exposed to either genuine or sham irradiation in two separate sessions. In both experiments, electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at midline electrode sites before and after exposure while subjects were watching a silent documentary. Spectral power of sEEG data was analyzed in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. In the ERP experiment, subjects were presented with a random series of standard (90%) and frequency-deviant (10%) tones in a passive binaural oddball paradigm. The amplitude and latency of the P50, N100, P200, MMN, and P3a components were analyzed. We found no measurable effects of a 30 min 3G mobile phone irradiation on the EEG spectral power in any frequency band studied. Also, we found no significant effects of EMF irradiation on the amplitude and latency of any of the ERP components. In summary, the present results do not support the notion that a 30 min unilateral 3G EMF exposure interferes with human sEEG activity, auditory evoked potentials or automatic deviance detection indexed by MMN.

3691,"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy using the cyberknife for external auditory canal carcinoma Purpose/Objective(s): This is a retrospective study to evaluate the outcomes of external auditory canal carcinoma (EACC) treated with CyberKnife (CK) alone. Materials/Methods: Between May 2005 and March 2010, 37 patients with EACC were treated with hypofractionated SRT using CK at Yokohama CK center. The beam energy was 6 MV. Patients were lightly restrained with a custom-made thermoplastic face mask, and the 6D automated skull-tracking tracking method was utilized in all cases for patient alignment and target position correction during treatment. Of them, 24 patients were followed up more than 12 months, which were analyzed. They were 12 male and 12 female. According to Stell classification, 4 patients were Stage I, 8 patients were Stage II, and 12 patients were Stage III. Age was ranging 47 years to 89 years, median 61 years. Tumor volume was raging 7.2ml to 105.6ml, median 42.6ml. The subscribed marginal dose (D95) was 28.0Gy to 42.5Gy (median 35.0Gy) with 3 to 5 stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). No patient underwent previous radiation therapy. Result(s): Follow-up periods was raging three to 32 months, median 26 months. One patient died of acute myocardial infarction 4 months after CK treatment. The control rate of Stell I, II and III was 75%, 62% and 75%, respectively. One patient with Stell III was showing cerebella abscess three months after CK treatment. This patient was showing dural invasion at CT treatment. There was no direct radiation injury observed at present. Facial nerve function was preserved. Conclusion(s): Surgical approach to EACC is invasive and results in mal function of facial movement and mandible. Our data is preliminary; however showing CK treatment is feasible for EACC. CK treatment is less invasive and able to maintain function.",Excluded
3642,"The single institutional outcome of postoperative radiotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer Purpose: This study was conducted to observe the outcomes of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) with or without concurrent chemotherapy in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in single institution. Material(s) and Method(s): From 2002 to 2013, 78 patients diagnosed with NSCLC after curative resection were treated with radiotherapy alone (RT, n = 48) or concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT, n = 30). The indications of adjuvant radiation therapy were N2 node positive (n = 31), close or involved resection margin (n = 28), or gross residual disease due to incomplete resection (n = 19). The median radiation dose was 57.6 Gy (range, 29.9 to 66 Gy). Result(s): Median survival time was 33.7 months (range, 4.4 to 140.3 months). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 49.5% (RT 46% vs. CCRT 55.2%; p = 0.731). The 3-year disease-free survival rate was 45.5% (RT 39.4% vs. CCRT 55.3%; p = 0.130). The 3-year local control rate was 68.1% (RT 64.4% vs. CCRT 77.7%; p = 0.165). The 3-year DMFS rate was 56.1% (RT 52.6% vs. CCRT 61.7%; p = 0.314). In multivariate analysis, age >=66 years and pathologic stage III were significant poor prognostic factors for OS. Treatment failure occurred in 40 patients. Four patients had radiologically confirmed grade 3 radiation pneumonitis. Conclusion(s): In NSCLC, adjuvant RT or CCRT after curative surgery is a safe and feasible modality of treatment. OS gain was seen in patients less than 66 years. Postoperative CCRT showed a propensity of achieving better local control and improved disease-free survival compared to RT alone according to our data.Copyright © 2014 The Korean Society for Radiation Oncology.",Excluded
3797,"The application of basic fibroblast growth factor to auricles of rabbits with compound injury OBJECTIVE: To study the role of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the repair of irradiation- and surgery-induced auricle trauma. METHOD(S): The bilateral auricles of New Zealand white rabbits were received surgical trauma and beta-active irradiation(90Sr-90Y), bFGF was then applied to the wound. The efficacy of bFGF on wound healing was compared with the control group. RESULT(S): On the 10th day after the trauma, the mean epithelalized area was (34.17 +/- 0.37) mm2 and the mean number of microvessels/high power field was (10.25 +/- 2.34) in the treated group, whereas both were (26.25 +/- 0.20) mm2 and (4.38 +/- 0.92) respectivety in the control group. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). On the 7th and 14th days after the trauma, the mean epithelialized area in the treated group was significantly different from that of the control group. The measurement by the image cytometry showed that the treated group had a mean nuclear peak area value of (38.28 +/- 7.23) micron 2 and the mean S-stage cell value of (31.28 +/- 10.35)%, and those of the control group were (28.02 +/- 8.13) micron 2 and (20.14 +/- 9.46)% respectively.

4407,"X-ray-induced sterility in Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) and male longevity following irradiation The mosquito Aedes albopictus (Skuse, 1895) is a potent vector of several arboviral diseases, most notably chikungunya and dengue fever. In the context of the sterile insect technique (SIT), the sterilization of the male mosquitoes before their release can be achieved by gamma-ray irradiation. As gamma-ray irradiators are becoming increasingly problematic to purchase and transport, the suitability of an X-ray irradiator as an alternative for the sterilization of Ae. albopictus males was studied. The sterilization of up to 200,000 pupae at one time can be achieved with relative ease, and the sterility results obtained were comparable with those achieved by gamma irradiation, where 99% sterility is induced with a dose of 40 Gy. A significant reduction of longevity was observed in the latter stages of the males' life after irradiation treatments, especially at doses > 40 Gy, which is consistent with the negative effects on longevity induced by similar radiation doses using gamma rays. Females irradiated at 40 Gy were not only 100% sterile, but also failed to oviposit entirely, i.e., all of the females laid 0 eggs. Overall, it was found that the X-ray irradiator is generally suitable for the sterilization process for sterile insect technique programs, as it showed a high processing capacity, practicality, high effectiveness, and reproducibility.",Excluded
4184,"Radiation exposure during percutaneous nephrostomy Radiation doses of radiologists, assistants and patients during 21 percutaneous nephrostomies (PN) (including 11 unilateral and 5 bilateral procedures) were measured using an area-exposure meter and thermoluminescent dosimeters. The mean fluoroscopy time per PN was 12 min and the mean product of air kerma and the cross-sectional area of the fluoroscopic beam was 8.0 (range 0.41-24) Gycm2. Doses to the radiologists and assistants were generally modest, and the yearly dose limits of ICRP will not be exceeded in practice. The doses to the radiologist's fingers were found to be the most restrictive in this study. Regarding the mean dose to the radiologist's fingers (190 muGy), the yearly dose limit of 500 mSv would be exceeded after about 2600 PNs provided that his fingers are not otherwise exposed. With the maximal finger dose of 1100 muGy, this would occur after about 450 yearly PNs.",Excluded
4382,"'Glowing in the dark': A study of radiation received by desmoid patients undergoing multiple CT scans Aim: Patients with FAP related intra-abdominal desmoid disease undergo multiple CT scans of abdomen, pelvis, and sometimes chest to monitor the response to treatment and assess the possibility of recurrent or new tumors. CT is generally preferred to MRI because of the better quality and more easily interpretable images. However there is concern about the cumulative dose of radiation associated with multiple CT scans. This retrospective study, was performed to assess the radiation exposure of FAP desmoid patients related to CT scans Method: Patients with intra-abdominal desmoid disease related to FAP managed in our department were accessed. The number of abdominal/ pelvic and chest CTs from the time of desmoid diagnosis to the last imaging follow-up was totaled. When available, the radiation dose was obtained, when not, an average dose was applied. Patient demographics and the worst stage of the desmoid disease were noted. In this study we report only the 22 patients with more than 13 CT scans over the time of follow-up Results: There were 22 patients 7 men and 15 women, with a mean age at desmoids diagnosis of 28.4 +/- 1.0 years. Three desmoids were Stage II, 7 were stage III and 12 were stage IV. Mean follow-up was 111 months (median 107, range 34-215). The mean total number of abdominal/pelvic CT scans was 28 (median 31, range 14-42) and chest CT scans was 4.8 (median 3.5, range 0-18). The mean frequency of scans was every 4.5 months (median 3.9, range every 1 month to every 12 months). The mean cumulative dose of radiation associated with abdominal/pelvic CTs was 491 mGy*cm, equivalent to 491 mSv (0.491Sv). The highest dose in a patient with a stage IV desmoid receiving 42 CT scans over 10.5 years was 574 mSv (0.57Sv). 1 Sv is associated with a 0.055% chance of cancer. The additional dose associated with Chest CT was a mean of 265 mSv (0.26 Sv) Conclusion(s): In patients with advanced abdominal desmoid disease, the total dose of radiation accumulated over a mean of 9 years follow up is significant in terms of predisposing to cancer. This should encourage the use of alternative forms of imaging such as MRI or at least a less frequent use of CT scans.",Excluded
4358,"Radioiodide (131I) therapy for the treatment of canine thyroid carcinoma OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of radioactive iodine treatment (131I) for canine thyroid carcinoma, as both the sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of case records from the Gladesville Veterinary Hospital Nuclear Medicine Service, Sydney, between August 1988 and December 2001. CASE DETAILS: The records of 65 dogs with thyroid carcinoma were analysed according to therapy and outcome. Forty-three dogs received radioiodide therapy, either as the sole therapeutic modality (32) or as an adjunct to surgery (11). Radioisotope therapy consisted of one to three doses of 131I with a dose range of 555 to 1850 MBq. For analysis, dogs were divided into groups according to therapy: no treatment, surgery alone, surgery with radioiodide therapy or radioiodide therapy alone. Mode of therapy, dosage of 131I, clinical staging and age were all independently analysed according to survival to compare efficacy or predictive value respectively. RESULT(S): When radioiodide therapy was used as an adjunct to surgery, median survival was 34 months. Censored median survival time for dogs that received radioiodide alone was 30 months. Dogs that did not receive treatment had a median survival of only 3 months. Log rank statistical analysis indicated that mode of therapy was significantly correlated with survival but that clinical stage of disease was not. CONCLUSION(S): The authors conclude that 131I therapy is effective at extending survival time, both as a sole therapeutic modality and as an adjunct to surgery, in dogs with invasive canine thyroid carcinoma. Incomplete surgical resection may not prolong survival in dogs also receiving 131I therapy, however surgical resection with curative intent should be recommended as the first line of therapy for mobile thyroid carcinomas. Radioisotope therapy can be recommended for cases where surgery alone is considered unlikely to be curative because of metastatic disease or local invasion, or for cases where surgery has been attempted but complete surgical removal has not been achieved.",Excluded
3730,"Combined radiochemotherapy with paclitaxel in the treatment of malignant glioma BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel is a radiosensitizing agent that shows a synergistic effect with radiation in malignant glioma cells. A phase I/II trial was performed in order to evaluate both feasibility and outcome of combined radiochemotherapy in malignant glioma., PATIENTS AND METHODS: 56 patients were included in the trial. Paclitaxel was administered on days 1-4, 15-18 and 29-32 18 to 24 hours prior to irradiation. Radiotherapy with 60 Gy in conventional fractionation was initiated on day 2.31 patients were included in a dose-escalation trial starting with 20 mg/m2/d and increasing up to 60 mg/m2/d in 10-mg steps. Additional 25 patients were treated with 50 mg/m2/d., RESULTS: The regimen was very well tolerated with minimal subjective impairment such as sickness or weakness. Maximal tolerable dose was 50 mg/m2/d, with neutropenia being the dose-limiting toxicity. There were four allergic reactions and five thromboembolisms; furthermore, one patient with a normal blood count died due to pneumonia. The median survival was 12 months, and significantly favorable factors were a young age, a lower tumor grade (grade 3) and a complete resection. Varying the paclitaxel dose had no influence on outcome., CONCLUSIONS: Combined radiochemotherapy with paclitaxel in the treatment of malignant glioma was well tolerated.

3461,"A prospective, matched comparison of ultra-low and standard-dose computed tomography for assessment of renal colic OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULDCT) compared with standard-dose CT (SDCT) in the evaluation of patients with clinically suspected renal colic, in addition to secondary features (hydroureteronephrosis, perinephric stranding) and additional pathological entities (renal masses)., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, comparative cohort study was conducted amongst patients presenting to the emergency department with signs and symptoms suggestive of renal or ureteric colic. Patients underwent both SDCT and ULDCT. Single-blinded review of the image sets was performed independently by three board-certified radiologists., RESULTS: Among 21 patients, the effective radiation dose was lower for ULDCT [mean (SD) 1.02 (0.16) mSv] than SDCT [mean (SD) 4.97 (2.02) mSv]. Renal and/or ureteric calculi were detected in 57.1% (12/21) of patients. There were no significant differences in calculus detection and size estimation between ULDCT and SDCT. A higher concordance was observed for ureteric calculi (75%) than renal calculi (38%), mostly due to greater detection of calculi of <3 mm by SDCT. Clinically significant calculi (>=3 mm) were detected by ULDCT with high specificity (97.6%) and sensitivity (100%) compared to overall detection (specificity 91.2%, sensitivity 58.8%). ULDCT and SDCT were highly concordant for detection of secondary features, while ULDCT detected less renal cysts of <2 cm. Inter-observer agreement for the ureteric calculi detection was 93.9% for SDCT and 87.8% for ULDCT., CONCLUSION: ULDCT performed similarly to SDCT for calculus detection and size estimation with reduced radiation exposure. Based on this and other studies, ULDCT should be considered as the first-line modality for evaluation of renal colic in routine practice.

3861,"Metformin use and improved response to therapy in rectal cancer Locally advanced rectal cancer is commonly treated with chemoradiation prior to total mesorectal excision (TME). Studies suggest that metformin may be an effective chemopreventive agent in this disease as well as a possible adjunct to current therapy. In this study, we examined the effect of metformin use on pathologic complete response (pCR) rates and outcomes in rectal cancer. The charts of 482 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma treated from 1996 to 2009 with chemoradiation and TME were reviewed. Median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy (range 19.8-63). Nearly, all patients were treated with concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (98%) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (81.3%). Patients were categorized as nondiabetic (422), diabetic not taking metformin (40), or diabetic taking metformin (20). No significant differences between groups were found in clinical tumor classification, nodal classification, tumor distance from the anal verge or circumferential extent, pretreatment carcinoembryonic antigen level, or pathologic differentiation. pCR rates were 16.6% for nondiabetics, 7.5% for diabetics not using metformin, and 35% for diabetics taking metformin, with metformin users having significantly higher pCR rates than either nondiabetics (P = 0.03) or diabetics not using metformin (P = 0.007). Metformin use was significantly associated with pCR rate on univariate (P = 0.05) and multivariate (P = 0.01) analyses. Furthermore, patients taking metformin had significantly increased disease-free (P = 0.013) and overall survival (P = 0.008) compared with other diabetic patients. Metformin use is associated with significantly higher pCR rates as well as improved survival. These promising data warrant further prospective study. © 2013 The Authors.

4027,"Tube placement using 'IRIS': A pilot assessment of its utility and safety INTRODUCTION: Most critically ill patients have a feeding tube placed blindly, but 0.5% result in a major lung complication because misplacement is only detected at the end of procedure. Real-time guided tube placement may pre-empt such complications. This clinical effectiveness study examined the ability to visualise anatomy using KangarooTM feeding tubes with IRIS technology ('IRIS' tube). METHOD(S): In a single centre, gastric or intestinal integrated real-time imaging system (IRIS) tubes were prospectively placed in critically ill patients noting the anatomical visualisation. RESULT(S): Of 15 placements, 13 were successful gastric placements and used for feeding but one gastric and one intestinal placement failed because of signal loss and inability to find the pylorus, respectively; both tubes were removed. Air insufflation and fluid aspiration were possible with all tubes. Respiratory misplacement was clearly differentiated, prior to reaching the main carina, from gastrointestinal (GI) anatomical markers, permitting removal before causing trauma. Furthermore, non-traumatic placement was visualised in high-risk cases including during advancement through a nostril with a base of skull fracture and into a stomach with a recently haemorrhaging gastric polyp. Individually assessed, direct vision may offer greater safety. X-ray or pH of aspirated fluid confirmed the position of GI tube placements. One adverse event occurred during placement, reversible bradycardia, in a patient previously having bradycardia. Vision was intermittently obscured by bile, mucus or impaction with mucosa. CONCLUSION(S): 'IRIS' tubes offer real-time guidance regarding anatomical position. Larger studies are needed to establish the best techniques of deploying this equipment and over-coming the difficulties observed.Crown Copyright © 2021. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The clinical feasibility of the ultrasound-guided lumbar medial-branch block has been demonstrated. We evaluated the success rate and validity of this new method by use of fluoroscopy controls in patients previously diagnosed with lumbar facet joint-mediated pain. Method(s): In 20 patients, 101 lumbar medial-branch blocks were performed under ultrasound guidance. The target point was the groove at the cephalad margin of the transverse process adjacent to the superior articular process. C-arm fluoroscopy was performed afterward to confirm the needle position. Pain scores were assessed by use of visual analog scale (VAS 0 to 100). Result(s): All 101 needles were placed in the correct lumbar segment. Ninety-six of the 101 needletips were in the correct position with a success rate of 95%. Two needles were associated with intravascular spread of the contrast dye. VAS score was reduced from 52 to 16 after the block. Conclusion(s): Ultrasound-guided lumbar medial-branch blocks can be performed with a high success rate. However, to be completely independent from fluoroscopy controls, this technique requires further studies regarding the detection of intravascular spread. © 2006 American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.",Excluded
3611,"Evaluation of the genotoxic effects of chronic low-dose ionizing radiation exposure on nuclear medicine workers INTRODUCTION: Nuclear medicine workers are occupationally exposed to chronic ionizing radiation. It is known that ionizing radiation may have damaging effects on chromosomes. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic effects of ionizing radiation on nuclear medicine workers. We used two different indicators of genotoxicity methods: sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN)., METHODS: The present research was carried out using 21 nuclear medicine workers (11 females and 10 males) during two periods: during normal working conditions and after a 1-month vacation. The radiation dose varied from 1.20 to 48.56 mSv, which accumulated during the occupational exposure time between two vacations. Peripheral blood samples were taken from each subject for two distinct lymphocyte cultures (SCE and MN) in each period., RESULTS: In nearly all subjects, SCE values increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05). Similarly, MN frequencies in most of the subjects increased significantly during radiation exposure compared to the postvacation period (P<.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that both SCE and MN frequencies in most of the subjects were significantly higher during exposure to ionizing radiation than after a 1-month vacation period.

4227,"Validity of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection following adjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) The effect of preoperative radio chemotherapy on lymphatic drainage and intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection has yet not been investigated. In this study, we study 13 patients with SCC. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging of the patients was performed using SPECT-CT. Special care was taken to use identical injection sites for both studies. Imaging comprised planar and SPECT, iterative reconstruction and were viewed with the co-registered CT image. The results were validated by comparison with the histological results of intraoperative gamma probe detection and histology of the completed neck dissection. Identical SLNs were found in 6/13 patients. In 2/13 cases SLN biopsies were false-negative. In 4/13 patients preoperative SLN imaging identified more/additional nodes than the initial imaging, whereas fewer nodes were seen in 3/13 patients. Neither the primary tumor site nor the TNM stage was predictive for changes in the lymphatic drainage pattern. No constant effect of irradiation could be demonstrated. Preoperative radio chemotherapy has an unpredictable influence on the lymphatic drainage pattern in HNSCC. Consequently, the intraoperative gamma probe-guided sentinel lymph node detection after radio chemotherapy does not reveal the SLN of carcinogenesis. Thus, we advise fused functional/anatomical imaging (SPECT-CT) before and after radiochemotherapy if the SLN concept is utilized in HNSCC.",Excluded
3965,"Twice-daily Thoracic Radiotherapy for Limited-stage Small-cell Lung Cancer Does Not Increase the Incidence of Acute Severe Esophagitis PURPOSE: Acute esophagitis is common after thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) given with chemotherapy for limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (LS SCLC). Although twice-daily TRT to 45 Gy in 30 fractions is considered standard, some clinicians are reluctant to use this schedule because of its perceived impracticality and risk of severe esophagitis. We reviewed a single-institution experience with severe (grade >= 3) esophagitis after TRT with chemotherapy for LS SCLC., PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 504 patients were identified as having received TRT (>=45 Gy) with platinum-containing chemotherapy for LS SCLC at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 1987 through 2012. Patients with complete or good partial response were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation. Esophagitis was scored retrospectively with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V3.0. Clinical variables were analyzed for possible association with acute grade >= 3 esophagitis., RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 23.9 months (range, 1.2-240.8 months), 103 (20%) patients had experienced grade >= 3 esophagitis. In univariate analysis, TRT dose >= 60 Gy was the only factor associated with severe esophagitis (odds ratio [OR], 1.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-3.30; P = .043); use of twice-daily TRT was not (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.61-1.52; P = .867). The significance of TRT to >= 60 Gy was maintained in multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for tumor size (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.05-3.46; P = .034)., CONCLUSIONS: TRT to >= 60 Gy predicted acute severe esophagitis, but twice-daily fractionation did not. Standard-dose 45-Gy twice-daily TRT should not be avoided for fear of severe esophagitis. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4277,"High validity of measuring the width and volume of medial meniscal extrusion three-dimensionally using an MRI-derived tibial model Background: Medial meniscal extrusion (MME) is an important marker of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) progression. The purposes of this study were: 1) to determine whether there are morphological differences between CT- and MRI-derived tibial plateau models; and 2) to determine whether measurement of MME volume and width using an MRI-derived tibial model is as accurate as measurements on a CT-derived tibial model. Method(s): This was a cross-sectional study that enrolled ten participants with medial KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 1 to 3). Primary outcome was surface difference of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived models. Furthermore, volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau were compared between CT- and MRI-derived models. Measurements of MME volume and width were compared between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. Result(s): Minimal and maximal surface differences of the medial tibial plateau between the CT- and MRI-derived models were - 0.15 [- 0.44, 0.14] mm (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 0.24 [- 0.09, 0.57] mm, respectively. There were no significant differences in volume and cross-sectional area of the medial tibial plateau between CT- and MRI-derived tibial models. The MME volumes measured on CT- and MRI-derived models were 942.6 [597.7, 1287.6] mm3 and 916.2 [557.9, 1274.6] mm3, respectively (p = 0.938). The MME widths measured on CT- and MRI-derived models were 4.2 [1.9, 6.5] mm and 4.5 [2.2, 6.9] mm, respectively (p = 0.967).

All patients were over 18 years old, had positive rotator cuff tear tests, and underwent X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging. The arthroscopic images showed rotator cuff tears, with indication for repair. The functional status of each patient was evaluated using the Constant-Murley Scale and the criteria of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). During postoperative rehabilitation, we applied Cohen's protocol. Seventeen patients were female and 13 were male. The median age was 54 years (21-83). Sixteen patients had partial thickness tears and 14 patients had full-thickness tears. Repair technique: Single-row in 13 patients, suture-bridge in 15 patients, transosseous-equivalent in two patients. Four patients with SLAP lesions were treated by debridement labrum for type I, and labral repair for more serious lesions. Five patients with long head biceps tendon rupture were treated with tenodesis. After surgery, 100% of patients were subjected to fluid extravasation through the shoulder joint, but did not have any compartment syndrome; all incisions healed good without infection or neurapraxia. The mean UCLA score was 32.4 (14 patients had excellent results, 14 good, and two fair). The mean Constant score was 38.5; the mean postoperative Constant score was 88.77 (p = 0.001). Among the patients, 90% achieved 80% function compared to a normal shoulder. All patients gave their consent to the study and were prepared for the full course of treatment and arthroscopic surgery. Repair of the rotator cuff was for some participants the only effective treatment and a way to restore the shoulder. Postoperative reconstruction of the rotator cuff of the shoulder resulted in a significant improvement in the indicators of the functional state of the shoulder joint.Copyright © FUNPEC-RP.",Excluded
4370,"Identification of ERp29 as a biomarker for predicting nasopharyngeal carcinoma response to radiotherapy Radioresistance continues to be a major problem in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance. We used a mass spectrometry driven-proteomic strategy to identify novel proteins associated with NPC radio-resistance, and differential proteins were subsequently processed by bio-informatic analysis. As a result, twelve proteins were identified with aberrant expression in radioresistant (RR) NPC tissues compare to radiosensitive (RS) NPC tissues. Among these proteins, ERp29, Mn-SOD, HSP27 and GST omega1 were found to be significantly up-regulated in RR NPC tissues, and ERp29 was selected for further validation. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that ERp29 was overexpressed in RR NPC tissues compared with RS NPC tissues. To prove the role of ERp29 in the induction of NPC radioresistance, ERp29 was down-regulated in the ERp29 enriched NPC cells CNE-1 and 6-10B by specific shRNA. Radiosensitivity was measured using cell proliferation assay and clonogenic survival assay, and cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometric analysis. We found that ERp29 knockdown attenuated CNE-1 and 6-10B cell radioresistance and enhanced cell apoptosis. These results suggest that ERp29 associates with radioresistance in NPC, and ERp29 could be a potential biomarker for predicting NPC response to radiotherapy.",Included
4021,"Clinical outcome of radiation therapy for ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas Purpose/Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to evaluate the longterm treatment outcomes and patterns of failure in patients with primary ocular adnexal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma treated with involved-field radiation therapy. Materials/Methods: Patients who were pathologically diagnosed as Stage IE/IIE ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma and underwent radiation therapy were retrospectively analyzed. Since 2006, 55 patients received radiation therapy and were followed up for more than 6 months at our institution. At initial presentation, 53 patients had Stage IE disease and two had Stage IIE disease. There were 28 men and 27 women. The median age was 66 years (range, 39-90 years). Local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): The median follow-up period was 47 months (range, 6-90 months). The median radiation dose was 30 Gy (range, 30-30.6 Gy in 15- 17 fractions). All patients were treated by radiation alone, but oral steroid was used for four patients who had double vision at the beginning of treatment. Thirty-four patients were treated with 6 MV photon beams with a wedged pair of fields. Nineteen patients with a lesion confined to the conjunctive or eyelid were treated with 9 MeV electron beams with a single anterior field. In the remaining two patients, combination of the two beams was used. A lead lens block was used in 16 patients. Six patients had bilateral lesions and were treated simultaneously. The 5-year LC rate was 100%. In two patients, local recurrence was suspected at 44 and 46 months, respectively, after radiation therapy, but both of them were diagnosed to have IgG4-related inflammation by biopsy, with no evidence of malignancy upon histological and immunohistochemical examinations. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 89% and 100%, respectively. Four patients had recurrence at a distant site. The median time to recurrence was 24 months. Three of the four patients received systemic chemotherapy with R-CHOP and another patient is being followed up without second line treatment. One patient developed retinal detachment incidentally during radiation therapy and underwent surgery thereafter. There was no other Grade 3 or higher acute morbidity. Eleven patients had Grade 2 late morbidity (dry eye, 2; cataract, 9). Sixteen patients had Grade 3 cataract. No patients had severe late adverse events other than cataract. Conclusion(s): Patients with localized ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma achieved excellent local control after 30 Gy of radiation therapy alone. Local regrowth of the mass was observed in two patients, but both were diagnosed as IgG4-related disease. Association between MALT lymphoma and IgG4-related disease has been reported recently, and in such cases it should be born in mind.",Excluded
4352,"Do persons living near a uranium processing site have evidence of increased somatic cell gene mutations? A first study The objective of this study was to examine if individuals living near a uranium processing site have greater mutagenic damage, as measured by three mutagenicity assays, compared with subjects unexposed to any nuclear facilities. The design was a cross-sectional exploratory analysis of 112 subjects; 56 volunteer residents were from within a 5-mile radius of the Fernald Uranium Processing site and 56 'control' subjects were from a geographically separate area unexposed to any known uranium emissions. The groups were constrained to be similar in age and sex composition. The main outcome measures were three human somatic gene mutation assays consisting of the HPRT T-lymphocyte cloning assay to measure 6-thioguanine resistant lymphocytes; the glycophorin A assay to detect the loss of expression of the M or N allele; and the micronucleus assay as a marker of chromosomal damage. The results showed no statistically significant or quantitatively important differences between groups for all three mutagenicity assays; only the unselected cloning efficiency was statistically significantly different between groups (0.42 +/- 0.16 for the Fernald versus 0.35 +/- 0.12 for the comparison groups). In both groups, age was significantly related to HPRT mutant frequency, with a 1.25% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the Fernald group and a 1.12% rate of increase in mutant frequencies for each 1-year gain of age in the comparison group. For the micronucleus data, females had a greater mean micronucleus frequency than males. In addition, smokers had an increased mean ln (natural logarithm) HPRT mutant frequency (3.06 +/- 0.14 for current smokers compared with a mean of 2.72 +/- 0.05 for non-current (i.e. never plus former) smokers). Our results are consistent with the previously reported association between sex type and micronucleus frequency, the known relationship between age and T-lymphocyte cloning efficiency and age and HPRT mutant frequency, and verify the wide inter-subject variability for the latter. Finally, we conclude that at a population level, the relationships between current cigarette use and HPRT mutant frequency, and sex type and micronucleus frequency, are stronger than is the association between geographic proximity to a uranium processing site and mutagenic abnormalities.",Included
4183,"What factors influence radiologists' finger doses during percutaneous drainages under fluoroscopic guidance? Radiation exposure of radiologists' left and right hands during 44 percutaneous drainages involving fluoroscopy was measured with thermoluminescent dosimeters. Finger doses of 3.4-1,300 microGy (mean 180, median 110) were recorded. Finger exposure seemed to show a significant, positive correlation with the screening time, but not with the patients' body mass indexes or ages. The mean personal doses of the radiologists were different and, in one case, the difference between the individual radiologists' doses was statistically significant. The personal working technique may therefore partly explain the amount of radiation exposure to the fingers.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Sixty consecutive patients were randomly assigned to two different retrospectively ECG-gated TRO-CTA protocols in this prospective trial: Thirty patients were examined with a 120-kV standard protocol (320 reference mAs with automatic tube current modulation, automatically adapted pitch and ECG-pulsing) and served as the control group (group 1), an otherwise identical 100 kV protocol was used in the other thirty patients (group 2) for a radiation dose reduction. Subjective image quality was assessed on a 5 point scale (1: excellent, 5: non-diagnostic) by two blinded observers. Quantitative image analysis assessed vascular attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in different vascular segments. The effective dose was calculated from the dose length product (DLP) using a conversion coefficient of 0.017 mSv mGy -1 cm-1. Result(s): There was no significant difference of age, BMI, heart rate, pitch or scan length between both patient groups. Subjective image quality was rated similar in both groups (group 1: 1.2 +/- 0.4, group 2: average score = 1.3 +/- 0.5). Vessel attenuation was significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 (ascending aorta: 456 +/- 83 HU vs. 370 +/- 78 HU, p < 0.001; pulmonary artery: 468 +/- 118 HU vs. 411 +/- 91 HU, p = 0.03; left coronary artery: 437 +/- 110 HU vs. 348 +/- 89 HU, p < 0.001), however, there was no significant difference in SNR (13.2 +/- 7.6 vs. 14.5 +/- 7.5, p = 0.49) or CNR (13.8 +/- 6.6 vs. 15.9 +/- 7.7, p = 0.25). The effective radiation dose of the 100 kV protocol was significantly lower (9.6 +/- 3.2 mSv vs. 18.1 +/- 9.4 mSv, p < 0.0001).

4114,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy for lung cancer patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias Purpose To compare toxicity and survival after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) between lung cancer patients with or without idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), and to investigate the potential value of SBRT for the patients. Methods Among lung cancer patients receiving SBRT between 2005 and 2016, we evaluated those treated with a total dose of 40-60 Gy in five fractions with curative intent who either were staged as cT1-4N0M0 or experienced postoperative isolated local recurrence. We analyzed the incidence of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in all patients and local recurrence and overall survival (OS) in T1a-2a patients. Results A total of 508 patients were eligible, including 42 with IIPs. The median follow-up was 32.3 (6.0-120.9) months. Significantly more patients with IIPs had grade >=3 RP than did those without IIPs (12% vs. 3%, p = 0.009). The 2-year local recurrence rate was low in both groups (3.4% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.38). The 2-year OS rate was significantly lower in the patients with IIPs (42.2% vs. 80.9%, p < 0.001), although death from lung cancer was comparable (p = 0.74). Conclusion SBRT achieved excellent local control with acceptable pulmonary toxicity in lung cancer patients with IIPs.

3895,"Cell-mediated immunity in operable bronchial carcinoma: the effect of injecting irradiated autologous tumour cells and BCG In 52 patients undergoing tests of cell-mediated immunity before surgical resection of bronchial carcinoma a positive tuberculin test result was found in 71% compared with 68% of age- and sex-matched controls. Sensitisation to DNCB occurred in 52% of 37 patients but in 78% of controls. There was depression of lymphocyte transformation by PPD in 19 patients compared with controls (P=0.001), but there was no difference in lymphocyte transformation by PHA or pokeweed mitogen between 34 patients and controls. In a pilot study patients were randomly allocated to autograft (eight) or non-autograft (seven) groups. The autograft group were given an intradermal injection of a suspension of irradiated autologous tumour-cells mixed with intradermal BCG on the day of operation. Tests of cell-mediated immunity were repeated two weeks after operation. Five patients in each group received a course of radiotherapy to the mediastinum three weeks after operation. There was a rise in cutaneous tuberculin reactivity (P=0.08) and total leucocyte count (P=0.09) in the autograft group postoperatively with a fall in total lymphocyte and T lymphocyte counts in the non-autograft group (P less 0.05). These differences, however, were not followed by any difference in the frequency of tumour recurrence or the survival rate two years after operation. The results show that the immunological surveillance mechanism is impaired even in patients with early bronchial carcinoma and that it is possible to overcome postoperative immunological depression with specific immunotherapy combined with BCG. This treatment did not produce any clinical advantage in this small number of patients and the skin lesions caused the patients considerable discomfort.",Excluded
3547,"Amelioration of pain and histopathologic joint abnormalities in the Col1-IL-1beta(XAT) mouse model of arthritis by intraarticular induction of mu-opioid receptor into the temporomandibular joint OBJECTIVE: To evaluate opioid receptor function as a basis for novel antinociceptive therapy in arthritis., METHODS: We induced human mu-opioid receptor (HuMOR) expression in arthritic joints of mice, using the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vector, which is capable of stably transducing dividing, growth-arrested, and terminally differentiated cells. Male and female Col1-IL-1beta(XAT)-transgenic mice developed on a C57BL/6J background and wild-type littermates were studied., RESULTS: A single injection of FIV(HuMOR) into the temporomandibular joints of Col1-IL-1beta(XAT)-transgenic mice 1 week prior to induction of arthritis prevented the development of orofacial pain and joint dysfunction, and reduced the degree of histopathologic abnormality in the joint. In addition, FIV(HuMOR) prevented the attendant sensitization of trigeminal sensory neurons and activation of astroglia in brainstem trigeminal sensory nuclei. These effects were mediated by the transduction of primary sensory neurons via transport of FIV vectors from peripheral nerve endings to sensory ganglia, as evidenced by HuMOR expression in neuronal cell bodies located in the trigeminal ganglia, as well as in their proximal and distal nerve branches located in the main sensory and subnucleus caudalis of the brainstem and joints, respectively. The presence of MOR ligands predominantly in the descending trigeminal nucleus suggested that the observed antinociception occurred at the subnucleus caudalis. Articular chondrocytes and meniscal tissue were also infected by FIV(HuMOR), which presumably exerted an antiinflammatory effect on cartilage., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that prophylactic therapy with MOR overexpression in joints can successfully prevent the development of pain, dysfunction, and histopathologic abnormalities in the joints in arthritis. These findings may provide a basis for the future development of spatiotemporally controlled antinociceptive and antiinflammatory therapy for arthritis.",Excluded
3750,"Hepatic toxicity after radioembolization of the liver using 90Y-microspheres: Sequential lobar versus whole liver approach Purpose: 90Y-radioembolization (RE) is a promising technique for delivering high doses of radiation to liver tumors but may result in compromise of liver function. To gain further perspective, we evaluated the toxicity rates of sequential lobar versus whole liver 90Y-radioembolization. Method(s): Thirty-four patients with liver malignancy in noncirrhotic livers were included; 90Y-radioembolization was performed as either whole liver or sequential lobar treatment in 17 patients each. Standard clinical and liver specific laboratory parameters as well as MR imaging before treatment and at follow-up (6 and 12 weeks) after radioembolization were evaluated for toxicity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Volumetry of the liver, tumor, and spleen and measurement of portal vein diameter also were performed. Result(s): Three months after whole liver RE, 14 liver-related grade 3/4 events were recorded versus 2 events after sequential lobar treatment (P < 0.05). Three patients treated with whole liver RE suffered from radioembolization-induced liver disease (REILD). Pathological increases in bilirubin at 3 months were observed for the whole liver group only (52.3 vs. 18.7 mumol/l, P = 0.012). Total liver volume did not change significantly in either group, but shrinkage of the initially treated hepatic lobe with compensatory hypertrophy of the subsequently treated lobe was observed in the sequential lobar group (P < 0.05). Portal vein diameter increased significantly in whole liver-treated patients only (+17% vs. +6.6%, P = 0.043). Conclusion(s): Noncirrhotic patients undergoing sequential lobar radioembolization had less hepatic toxicity compared to whole liver embolization.

3610,"Support vector machine classification of brain metastasis and radiation necrosis based on texture analysis in MRI Purpose To develop a classification model using texture features and support vector machine in contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images to differentiate between brain metastasis and radiation necrosis. Methods Texture features were extracted from 115 lesions: 32 of them previously diagnosed as radiation necrosis, 23 as radiation-treated metastasis and 60 untreated metastases; including a total of 179 features derived from six texture analysis methods. A feature selection technique based on support vector machine was used to obtain a subset of features that provide optimal performance. Results The highest classification accuracy evaluated over test sets was achieved with a subset of ten features when the untreated metastases were not considered; and with a subset of seven features when the classifier was trained with untreated metastases and tested on treated ones. Receiver operating characteristic curves provided area-under-the-curve (mean+/-standard deviation) of 0.94+/-0.07 in the first case, and 0.93+/-0.02 in the second. Conclusion High classification accuracy (AUC>0.9) was obtained using texture features and a support vector machine classifier in an approach based on conventional MRI to differentiate between brain metastasis and radiation necrosis.Copyright © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4344,"Retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma: low-dose neoadjuvant radiation therapy followed by surgery with or without intraoperative radiotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy Background: We describe the clinical history, outcome, and toxicity of five patients with high-grade retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma (RSTS) who were treated with neoadjuvant low-dose radiotherapy (RT) followed by resection with or without intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), followed by adjuvant RT. We aim to provide additional evidence for the various treatment options that exist for this rare tumor entity. Method(s): Most patients presented with mild abdominal symptoms. Diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Additional imaging was done by sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). All patients were treated with neoadjuvant RT of 19.8Gy in 1.8-Gy fractions followed by resection and postoperative RT up to 45Gy with a median interval between resection and start of postoperative RT of 5 weeks. Two patients received additional IORT. Median follow-up was 61 months. Result(s): One patient developed a local recurrence that was diagnosed 30 months after the start of the first therapy. He was treated with a salvage resection and had no evidence of disease at the last follow-up. Another patient developed a right-sided RSTS on the contralateral side from the primary radiation field with pelvic bone infiltration 56 months after the start of RT. He was treated again by RT and resection and was without evidence of disease at last follow-up. Radiotherapy was well tolerated without major toxicity. Conclusion(s): The treatment of RSTS by low-dose neoadjuvant RT, resection with IORT and adjuvant RT seems to be a feasible and effective treatment approach. Further studies comparing neoadjuvant with adjuvant RT are necessary to find the best treatment option.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

3539,"Non-myeloablative busulfan chimeric mouse models are less pro-inflammatory than head-shielded irradiation for studying immune cell interactions in brain tumours Background: Chimeric mouse models generated via adoptive bone marrow transfer are the foundation for immune cell tracking in neuroinflammation. Chimeras that exhibit low chimerism levels, blood-brain barrier disruption and pro-inflammatory effects prior to the progression of the pathological phenotype, make it difficult to distinguish the role of immune cells in neuroinflammatory conditions. Head-shielded irradiation overcomes many of the issues described and replaces the recipient bone marrow system with donor haematopoietic cells expressing a reporter gene or different pan-leukocyte antigen, whilst leaving the blood-brain barrier intact. However, our previous work with full body irradiation suggests that this may generate a pro-inflammatory peripheral environment which could impact on the brain's immune microenvironment. Our aim was to compare non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning against head-shielded irradiation bone marrow chimeras prior to implantation of glioblastoma, a malignant brain tumour with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Method(s): Recipient wild-type/CD45.1 mice received non-myeloablative busulfan conditioning (25 mg/kg), full intensity head-shielded irradiation, full intensity busulfan conditioning (125 mg/kg) prior to transplant with whole bone marrow from CD45.2 donors and were compared against untransplanted controls. Half the mice from each group were orthotopically implanted with syngeneic GL-261 glioblastoma cells. We assessed peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen chimerism, multi-organ pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles at 12 weeks and brain chimerism and immune cell infiltration by whole brain flow cytometry before and after implantation of glioblastoma at 12 and 14 weeks respectively. Result(s): Both non-myeloablative conditioning and head-shielded irradiation achieve equivalent blood and spleen chimerism of approximately 80%, although bone marrow engraftment is higher in the head-shielded irradiation group and highest in the fully conditioned group. Head-shielded irradiation stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the blood and spleen but not in the brain, suggesting a systemic response to irradiation, whilst non-myeloablative conditioning showed no cytokine elevation. Non-myeloablative conditioning achieved higher donor chimerism in the brain after glioblastoma implantation than head-shielded irradiation with an altered immune cell profile. Conclusion(s): Our data suggest that non-myeloablative conditioning generates a more homeostatic peripheral inflammatory environment than head-shielded irradiation to allow a more consistent evaluation of immune cells in glioblastoma and can be used to investigate the roles of peripheral immune cells and bone marrow-derived subsets in other neurological diseases.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).",Excluded
4548,"Effectiveness of salvage radiation therapy following subtotal and gross total resection of atypical meningiomas Purpose/Objective(s): Postoperative management of WHO Grade II (atypical) meningioma remains controversial. Radiation therapy (RT) has been shown to improve local control in several retrospective studies, but outcomes of adjuvant versus salvage RT after a gross total resection (GTR) are not well understood.We reviewed the outcomes of patients treated with RT after GTR and subtotal resection (STR) at our institution, where radiation therapy (RT) has typically been reserved for salvage. Materials/Methods: Between 1997 and 2014, 76 patients with WHO Grade II meningiomas were treated at our institution. One patient with NF2 was excluded from this analysis. Of the 75 remaining patients, 62 underwent GTR (Simpson grade I e III) and 13 STR (Simpson IV-V). No patient with GTR received adjuvant RT. A total of 22 patients received RT: 10 as salvage of recurrence following GTR, 10 as salvage following STR, and 2 adjuvantly, each after biopsy only. Fractionated RT was employed in 18 patients, with doses ranging from 50.4-60 Gy (median 59.4 Gy) in 28-33 fractions, and stereotactic radiosurgery in 4 patients, with a single fraction of 15-18 Gy (median 17 Gy). Result(s): Extent of surgery was significantly predictive of progression-free survival (PFS). Following GTR and STR respectively, 2-year PFS was 75% versus 33%, and 4-year PFS 68% versus 17% (P = 0.0008). Despite a significant improvement in PFS after GTR, patients who recurred following GTR had a poor response to salvage RT, with 6 of the 10 patients continuing to progress despite RT. Conversely, none of the 12 patients who had undergone STR or biopsy experienced progression following RT. Respectively for GTR and STR, PFS following RT was 77% and 100% at 1 year, and 39% and 100% after 2 years (P = 0.04). Radiation dose was not significantly different between patients who progressed (median 56.7 Gy) and those who did not (median 60 Gy) following RT (P = 0.42). Likewise there was no difference in RT dose for those with GTR versus STR (median 60 Gy versus 59.4 Gy respectively, P = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In our patient cohort, salvage RT for recurrence following GTR was associated with a high rate of failure (61% at 2 years), whereas salvage or adjuvant RT following STR was effective, with no failures at 2 years. This data suggests that tumors recurring after GTR are biologically distinct from tumors that progress following STR. While extent of resection is predictive of PFS, the 4-year local failure following GTR alone was still 32%; therefore, adjuvant RT should be considered in this setting. Whether routine adjuvant RT following GTR of Grade II meningioma will significantly reduce subsequent failures remains to be determined. A randomized, prospective comparison of adjuvant RT after GTR is needed to resolve this question.",Excluded

During spaceflight, the target inter-response intervals were increasingly undershot and the timing became more variable (less regular). The increase in the timing variability was mostly attributable to the internal timekeeping processes rather than those involved in motor execution.

4286,"A statewide teleradiology system reduces radiation exposure and charges in transferred trauma patients BACKGROUND: Trauma transfer patients routinely undergo repeat imaging because of inefficiencies within the radiology system. In 2009, the virtual private network (VPN) telemedicine system was adopted throughout Oregon allowing virtual image transfer between hospitals. The startup cost was a nominal $3,000 per hospital., METHODS: A retrospective review from 2007 to 2012 included 400 randomly selected adult trauma transfer patients based on a power analysis (200 pre/200 post). The primary outcome evaluated was reduction in repeat computed tomography (CT) scans. Secondary outcomes included cost savings, emergency department (ED) length of stay (LOS), and spared radiation. All data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and chi-square tests. P less than .05 indicated significance. Spared radiation was calculated as a weighted average per body region, and savings was calculated using charges obtained from Oregon Health and Science University radiology current procedural terminology codes., RESULTS: Four-hundred patients were included. Injury Severity Score, age, ED and overall LOS, mortality, trauma type, and gender were not statistically different between groups. The percentage of patients with repeat CT scans decreased after VPN implementation: CT abdomen (13.2% vs 2.8%, P < .01) and cervical spine (34.4% vs 18.2%, P < .01). Post-VPN, the total charges saved in 2012 for trauma transfer patients was $333,500, whereas the average radiation dose spared per person was 1.8 mSV. Length of stay in the ED for patients with Injury Severity Score less than 15 transferring to the ICU was decreased (P < .05)., CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a statewide teleradiology network resulted in fewer total repeat CT scans, significant savings, decrease in radiation exposure, and decreased LOS in the ED for patients with less complex injuries. The potential for health care savings by widespread adoption of a VPN is significant. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Excluded

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors of CBOS after hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT)., METHODS AND PATIENTS: We conducted a matched-pair design examination of pharyngeal cancer patients treated by CyberKnife reirradiation in four institutes. Twelve cases with CBOS were observed per 60 cases without CBOS cases. Prognostic factors for CBOS were analyzed and a risk classification model was constructed., RESULTS: The median prescribed radiation dose was 30 Gy in 5 fractions with CyberKnife SBRT after 60 Gy/30 fractions of previous radiotherapy. The median duration between reirradiation and CBOS onset was 5 months (range, 0-69 months). CBOS cases showed a median survival time of 5.5 months compared to 22.8 months for non-CBOS cases (1-year survival rate, 36% vs.72%; p=0.003). Univariate analysis identified an angle of carotid invasion of >180degree, the presence of ulceration, planning treatment volume, and irradiation to lymph node areas as statistically significant predisposing factors for CBOS. Only patients with carotid invasion of >180degree developed CBOS (12/50, 24%), whereas no patient with tumor involvement less than a half semicircle around the carotid artery developed CBOS (0/22, 0%, p=0.03). Multivariate Cox hazard model analysis revealed that the presence of ulceration and irradiation to lymph nodes were statistically significant predisposing factors. Thus, we constructed a CBOS risk classification system: CBOS index=(summation of risk factors; carotid invasion >180degree, presence of ulceration, lymph node area irradiation). This system sufficiently separated the risk groups., CONCLUSION: The presence of ulceration and lymph node irradiation are risk factors of CBOS. The CBOS index, including carotid invasion of >180degree, is useful in classifying the risk factors and determining the indications for reirradiation. Copyright © 2015.

Clinical characteristics, including recurrent carcinoma conditions and dosimetric features, were evaluated as candidate risk factors for LNN. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors and construct the predictive scoring model., RESULTS: Among 228 patients enrolled in this study, 204 were at risk of developing LNN based on risk analysis. Of the 204 patients treated, 31 (15.2%) developed LNN. Logistic regression analysis showed that female sex (P = 0.008), necrosis before re-irradiation (P = 0.008), accumulated total prescription dose to the gross tumor volume (GTV) >=145.5 Gy (P = 0.043), and recurrent tumor volume >=25.38 cm(3) (P = 0.009) were independent risk factors for LNN. A model to predict LNN was then constructed that included these four independent risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: A model that includes sex, necrosis before re-irradiation, accumulated total prescription dose to GTV, and recurrent tumor volume can effectively predict the risk of developing LNN in NPC patients who undergo radical re-irradiation with IMRT.",Excluded
4023,"Relationship between body composition and development of diabetes in non-obese Japanese subjects Background : Body mass index (BMI) is a simple and good index to detect individuals with high risk of developing diabetes, though not all obese people develop diabetes. In comparison with populations in USA and Europe, Asian populations have a lower frequency of obesity, and a relatively higher risk of diabetes in non-obese populations. Although epidemiology studies reveal association between body composition and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, very few studies have examined the relationship between body composition and these risk factors in non-obese subjects. Objectives : The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine association of body composition with incidence of diabetes, a CVD risk factor, in non-obese Japanese subjects. Methods : The subjects of this study were 1,137 non-obese subjects without diabetes at baseline (368 males and 769 females, with an average age of 65.2) in the Hiroshima Adult Health Study that consists of atomic bomb survivors and their controls. Body composition was estimated by whole body DXA during the period from 1994 through 1996. We used percentages of trunk, leg, and arm fat in relation to total soft tissue mass as surrogate indicators of body fat distribution, and the ratio of appendicular lean mass/height2 (ALM/H2) as a surrogate indicator of appendicular muscle mass volume. Diabetes was defined by fasting glucose >=126mg/dl (7.0 mmol/L) or random glucose >= 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), a history of diabetes diagnosis by a medical institution, or current treatment for diabetes. Results : During the follow-up period lasting until 2011, 133 subjects developed diabetes. In Cox regression analyses with adjustment for BMI, presence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, radiation dose, and smoking and alcohol consumption status, significant negative association was observed between ALM/H2 and diabetes risk in men. Regarding body fat distribution, trunk fat percentage was positively associated with the incidence of diabetes and it was statistically significant only in men. On the other hand, leg fat percentage was significantly and negatively associated with the incidence of diabetes in women. . Significant association between the percentage of arm fat and diabetes risk was not observed in either gender. Conclusions : Among non-obese subjects, we found body composition to be associated with diabetes risk. Therefore, for Japanese people, body composition may be a useful tool for identifying individuals with high risk of developing diabetes.",Excluded
4134,"Balloon kyphoplasty under three-dimensional radiography guidance Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (PBKP) is generally performed under two-dimensional (2D) radiography guidance (lateral- and anteroposterior (A-P) views) using C-arm fluoroscopy. However, 2D images taken by single-plane or bi-plane fluoroscopy cannot provide information regarding axial views, particularly the Z axis. Lack of information regarding the Z axis prevents the creation of three-dimensional (3D) images. Currently, there has been a progress in interventional X-ray systems, and they are capable of providing 3D radiographic images using a rotational angiography mode which is used to create 3D angiographies. In this report, we described the usefulness of 3D radiography guidance. Patients treated by PBKP was designed to evaluate the efficacy of 3D radiography guidance. These patients experienced osteoporotic vertebral fractures with severe pain. We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PBKP from February to December 2016. All patients had a single-level vertebral fracture and underwent surgery by 2D or 3D radiography guidance. We performed 16 patients in 3D radiography guidance, and 10 patients in traditional 2D radiography guidance. This 3D radiography guided PBKP increase the amount of the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) injection compared with ordinary 2D method. As a result, postoperative vertebral height and alignment were significantly improved. Both groups have no complication. To confirm the final results and make PBKP more effective, 3D radiography guidance is feasible and safe for balloon kyphoplasty.Copyright © 2017 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.",Excluded
3867,"Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy for Unresectable/Locally Recurrent Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes for patients with unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) treated with hypofractionated proton or photon radiation therapy (HF-RT)., METHODS: We retrospectively identified 66 patients with ICC who were treated with HF-RT from 2008 to 2018. Median age at RT was 76 years (range 30-92), including 27 patients (41%) aged >= 80 years. Median RT dose was 58.05 Gy (range 37.5-67.5), all delivered in 15 daily fractions. Thirty-two patients received proton RT and 34 patients received photon RT., RESULTS: Median follow-up times from diagnosis and RT start were 21 months and 14 months, respectively. In total, five patients (7.6%) developed local failure. The 2-year outcomes were 84% local control (LC) and 58% OS. Among the 51 patients treated with definitive intent, the 2-year LC rate was 93% and the OS rate was 62%. On multivariate analysis for LC, older age was associated with a lower risk of local failure [hazard ratio (HR) 0.91; p = 0.02], while prior surgery (HR 16.5; p = 0.04) and macrovascular invasion (HR 123.93; p = 0.02) were independently associated with an increased risk of local failure. On multivariate analysis for OS, female sex (HR 0.33; p = 0.001) and prior chemotherapy (HR 0.38; p = 0.003) remained significantly associated with OS. On multivariate analysis for OS, compared with photon RT, there was a trend towards improved survival with proton RT (HR 0.50; p = 0.05). The rate of overall grade 3 + toxicity was 11%. One patient developed radiation-induced liver disease and was treated with corticosteroids., CONCLUSIONS: HF-RT yields high rates of local control and is an effective modality to optimize biliary control for unresectable/locally recurrent ICC.",Excluded
3552,"Reduction of radiation exposure in cryoballoon ablation procedures: a single-centre study applying intracardiac echocardiography and other radioprotective measures Aims: The population treated with cryoballoon (CB) ablation is relatively young, and radiation protection is of major importance. We aimed to demonstrate that radiation exposure can be markedly reduced by intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) and optimized settings of the X-ray system., Methods and results: We analysed 100 patients undergoing CB pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. In 50 consecutive patients (25 male, 59 +/- 13 years; Group 1), we used ICE, skipped PV angiography prior to CB inflation, and avoided fluoroscopy whenever possible. Furthermore, we reduced the frame rate, minimized distance between patient and detector, and consequently applied collimation. These patients were compared with 50 similar preceding patients in Group 2 (29 male, 61 +/- 12 years). Total fluoroscopy time was reduced from 18 +/- 6 min in Group 2 to 12 +/- 5 min in Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, the dose area product was significantly lower (1555 +/- 1219 vs. 4935 +/- 2094 cGycm2, P < 0.001), total freezing time was significantly shortened (1855 +/- 399 vs. 2121 +/- 756 s, P = 0.031), and contrast media use was significantly reduced (66 +/- 25 vs. 109 +/- 27 mL, P < 0.001). At the same time, total procedure duration and complication rates did not differ significantly between both groups. After a 12 months follow-up, a similar percentage of patients was free from recurrences (74% in Group 1 vs. 78% in Group 2, P = 0.640)., Conclusion: Radiation exposure in CB PVI can be markedly reduced without prolonging procedure times, affecting the outcome or complication rates. Moreover, ICE seems to shorten total freezing time. Copyright Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved. © The Author 2016.

4065,"Impact of Hybrid Operating Rooms on Long-Term Clinical Outcomes Following Fenestrated and Branched Endovascular Aortic Repair Purpose: Evaluate the impact of hybrid operating room (HOR) guidance on the long-term clinical outcomes following fenestrated and branched endovascular repair (F-BEVAR) for complex aortic aneurysms. Material(s) and Method(s): Prospectively collected registry data were retrospectively analyzed to compare the procedural, short- and long-term outcomes of consecutive F-BEVAR performed from January 2010 to December 2014 under standard mobile C-arm versus hybrid room guidance in a high-volume aortic center. Result(s): A total of 262 consecutive patients, including 133 patients treated with a mobile C-arm equipped operating room and 129 with a HOR guidance, were enrolled in this study. Patient radiation exposure and contrast media volume were significantly reduced in the HOR group. Short-term clinical outcomes were improved despite higher case complexity in the HOR group, with no statistical significance. At a median follow-up of 63.3 months (Q1 33.4, Q3 75.9) in the C-arm group, and 44.9 months (Q1 25.1, Q3 53.5, p=0.53) in the HOR group, there was no statistically significant difference in terms of target vessel occlusion and limb occlusion. When the endograft involved 3 or more fenestrations and/or branches (complex F-BEVAR), graft instability (36% vs 25%, p=0.035), reintervention on target vessels (20% vs 11%, p=0.019) and total reintervention rates (24% vs 15%, p=0.032) were significantly reduced in the HOR group. The multivariable Cox regression analysis did not show statistically significant differences for long-term death and aortic-related death between the 2 groups. Conclusion(s): Our study suggests that better long-term clinical outcomes could be observed when performing complex F-BEVAR in the latest generation HOR.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.",Excluded
3906,"Butterfly wing colours: scale beads make white pierid wings brighter The wing-scale morphologies of the pierid butterflies Pieris rapae (small white) and Delias nigrina (common jezabel), and the heliconine Heliconius melpomene are compared and related to the wing-reflectance spectra. Light scattering at the wing scales determines the wing reflectance, but when the scales contain an absorbing pigment, reflectance is suppressed in the absorption wavelength range of the pigment. The reflectance of the white wing areas of P. rapae, where the scales are studded with beads, is considerably higher than that of the white wing areas of H. melpomene, which has scales lacking beads. The beads presumably cause the distinct matt-white colour of the wings of pierids and function to increase the reflectance amplitude. This will improve the visual discrimination between conspecific males and females. Copyright 2004 The Royal Society",Excluded
3755,"Dose-dependent expression of CLIP2 in post-Chernobyl papillary thyroid carcinomas A previous study on papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) in young patients who were exposed to 131iodine from the Chernobyl fallout revealed an exclusive gain of chromosomal band 7q11.23 in exposed cases compared to an age-matched control cohort. CLIP2, a gene located within band 7q11.23 was shown to be differentially expressed between exposed and non-exposed cases at messenger RNA and protein level. Therefore, a standardized procedure for CLIP2 typing of PTCs has been developed in a follow-up study. Here we used CLIP2 typing data on 117 post-Chernobyl PTCs from two cohorts of exposed patients with individual dose estimates and 24 non-exposed controls to investigate a possible quantitative dose-response relationship of the CLIP2 marker. The 'Genrisk-T' cohort consisted of 45 PTCs and the 'UkrAm' cohort of 72 PTCs. Both cohorts differed in mean dose (0.59 Gy Genrisk-T, 1.2 Gy UkrAm) and mean age at exposure (AaE) (2 years Genrisk-T, 8 years UkrAm), whilst the median latency (16 years Genrisk-T, 18 years UkrAm) was comparable. We analyzed the association between the binary CLIP2 typing and continuous thyroid dose with logistic regression. A clear positive dose-response relationship was found for young PTC cases [age at operation (AaO) < 20 years, AaE < 5 years]. In the elder age group a higher proportion of sporadic tumors is assumed due to a negligible dose response, suggesting different molecular mechanisms in sporadic and radiation-induced cases. This is further supported by the association of elder patients (AaO > 20 years) with positivity for BRAF V600E mutation.Copyright © The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

4295,"Radiation-induced sarcoma of head and neck: 50 years of experience at a single institution in an endemic area of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China Radiation-induced sarcoma in the head and neck (RISHN) is a rare condition whose clinical presentation and management remain difficult because of its low incidence. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the symptoms, diagnosis, and the treatment of 16,634 patients with head and neck disease, who received radiotherapy between 1960 and 2010 at the Affiliated Tumor Hospital and its predecessor, Guangxi Medical University, China. Among these patients, 16 with a first tumor of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and 1 with squamous carcinoma of the tongue met the criteria of RISHN in the head and neck. Our epidemiological data showed that the incidence of RISHN rose from 0.06 to 0.17% from 1960 to 2010; the 3-year overall survival rate was 19.1%, and 3-year diseasefree survival rate was 11.1%. The mean latency (SD) period was 93.2 (33) months. Based on the experiences at our institution, we suggest that RISHN is a rare complication after radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, especially NPC. Owing to its low incidence, it should not be a major factor affecting decisions about radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there may be a possibility of increasing incidence of RISHN after radiotherapy of NPC, as shown in our epidemiological results. Given the poor prognosis of RISHN, this possibility should be taken into serious consideration before determination of high-dose radiotherapy for patients with NPC and other head and neck tumors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.",Excluded
3498,"Risk of covid-19 infection of a bariatric surgery cohort at the beginning of the pandemic Background: Obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19. The first case in New York was reported in March 1st, 2020 but it is believed that the virus was already spreading during the prior months. In our institution, bariatric surgery was carried out as usual until March 18th, at which time 92 cases of COVID-19 were already admitted. We believe that bariatric patients could have been exposed to COVID-19 during this overlap and sought to evaluate incidence of infection among this high-risk cohort at our institution. We sought to determine the incidence of COVID-19 in patients undergoing bariatric surgery during the preceding months of the pandemic. Method(s): This is a cross-sectional study from a single major bariatric center in the Bronx, New York. Patients who underwent bariatric surgery from January to March 2020 were included. Medical records were assessed looking COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis. Additionally, phone interviews were made looking for COVID-19 symptoms and/or diagnosis outside our institution after the index operation. Result(s): A total of 203 patients were included. Eleven patients (5.4%) had post-op symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. Of those, 2 tested positive, 1 tested negative, 1 was diagnosed with X-ray findings, 6 were not tested and 1 had an alternate diagnosis. Additionally, 6 patients were tested negative without symptoms for different reasons. None of the patients identified had a severe disease.

4402,"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for post-pulmonary lobectomy isolated lung metastasis of thoracic tumor: Survival and side effects Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has emerged as an alternative treatment for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or metastatic pulmonary tumors. However, for isolated lung metastasis (ILM) of thoracic malignances after pulmonary lobectomy, reported outcomes of SBRT have been limited. This study evaluates the role of SBRT in the treatment of such patients. Method(s): A retrospective search of the SBRT database was conducted in three hospitals. The parameters analyzed in the treated patients were local control, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and the treatment-related side-effects. Result(s): In total, 23 patients with single ILM after pulmonary lobectomy treated with SBRT were identified and the median follow-up time was 14 months (range: 6.0-47.0 months). Local recurrences were observed in two patients during follow-up and the 1-year local control rate was 91.3%. Median PFS and OS for the studied cohort were 10.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 5.1-14.9 months] and 21.0 months (95% CI 11.4-30.6 months), respectively. Acute radiation pneumonitis (RP) of grade 2 or worse was observed in five (21.7%) and three (13.0%) patients, respectively. Other treatment-related toxicities included chest wall pain in one patient (4.3%) and acute esophagitis in two patients (8.7%). By Pearson correlation analysis, the planning target volume (PTV) volume and the volume of the ipsilateral lung exposed to a minimum dose of 5 Gy (IpV5) were significantly related to the acute RP of grade 2 or worse in present study (p < 0.05). The optimal thresholds of the PTV and IpV5 to predict RP of acute grade 2 or worse RP were 59 cm3 and 51% respectively, according to the receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis, with sensitivity/specificity of 75.0%/80.0% and 62.5%/80.0%. Conclusion(s): SBRT for post-lobectomy ILM was effective and well tolerated. The major reason for disease progression was distant failure but not local recurrence. The PTV and IpV5 are potential predictors of acute RP of grade 2 or higher and should be considered in treatment planning for such patients.Copyright © 2014 Xiong et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Excluded

3650,"Osteosarcoma of the flat bone Objective: We aimed to understand the biology of osteosarcoma of the flat bone, which is a rare tumor entity. Method(s): Cases with osteosarcoma of the flat bone were compared with those of the extremity in order to evaluate their clinicopathologic characteristics. And the influences of heterogeneous treatment modalities on outcome were analyzed. Result(s): Tumors of the flat bone comprised 91 (11.3%) of 806 osteosarcoma cases. Eight cases were secondary osteosarcoma associated with previous radiotherapy. Patients with a flat bone tumor were significantly older and more likely to present with metastases at diagnosis than extremity tumor. The proportions of female sex and chondroblastic subtype were higher among flat bone tumors than among extremity tumors. The 5-year overall survival and event-free survival rates were 35.2 +/- 5.4% and 24.7 +/- 5.5%, respectively. Although age and histologic response to pre-operative chemotherapy were not related to outcome of flat bone tumors, treatment modality influenced the survival. Patients treated surgically had better outcomes than those treated by another means. Radiation therapy did not appear to be an effective local control measure as surgery. Conclusion(s): Treatment outcome of the tumor of the flat bone was worse than extremity tumors.

4268,"Swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in head and neck cancer radiotherapy: longitudinal study OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationships between swallowing functional outcomes and nutritional status in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy (RT). METHOD(S): This longitudinal study included 122 patients. Data were collected at three time points: baseline (T1), the third week of RT (T2) and the completion of RT (T3). The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was used to assess the symptom of dysphagia and other toxicities; the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) was used to assess the patient-perceived swallowing functional outcomes; the nutritional status was evaluated by the weight ratio and the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA). The generalised estimating equation (GEE) was used to measure the correlation of MDADI with the weight ratio or PG-SGA and also to analyse the influential factors of swallowing functional outcomes. RESULT(S): The participants' acute dysphagia rates were 5.7% at T1, 69.7% at T2 and 77.9% at T3. The swallowing functional outcomes worsen over RT (p<0.001) and were associated with weight ratio (beta=0.032, p=0.008) and PG-SGA (beta=-0.115, p<0.001). GEE models showed that patients with cancer of the pharynx region, advanced stage, chemoradiotherapy and high RT dose perceived worse swallowing functional outcomes. Oral mucositis, pharynx mucositis and salivary gland inflammation were positively correlated with swallowing functional outcomes, and the pharynx mucositis presented the highest absolute value of beta. CONCLUSION(S): The swallowing functional outcomes were negatively correlated with nutritional status. Healthcare professionals should identify early on the population at higher risk and focus on multiple toxicities, especially the management of pharynx mucositis, to improve nutritional status.Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

3873,"Statistical shape modeling predicts patellar bone geometry to enable stereo-radiographic kinematic tracking Complications in the patellofemoral (PF) joint of patients with total knee replacements include patellar subluxation and dislocation, and remain a cause for revision. Kinematic measurements to assess these complications and evaluate implant designs require the accuracy of dynamic stereo-radiographic systems with 3D-2D registration techniques. While tibiofemoral kinematics are typically derived by tracking metallic implants, PF kinematic measurements are difficult as the patellar implant is radiotransparent and a representation of the resected patella bone requires either pre-surgical imaging and precise implant placement or post-surgical imaging. Statistical shape models (SSMs), used to characterize anatomic variation, provide an alternative means to obtain the representation of the resected patella for use in kinematic tracking. Using a virtual platform of a stereo-radiographic system, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the ability of an SSM to predict subject-specific 3D implanted patellar geometries from simulated 2D image profiles, and to formulate an effective data collection methodology for PF kinematics by considering accuracy for a variety of patient pose scenarios. An SSM of the patella was developed for 50 subjects and a leave-one-out approach compared SSM-predicted and actual geometries; average 3D errors were 0.45 +/- 0.07 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), which is comparable to the accuracy of traditional segmentation. Further, initial imaging of the patella in five unique stereo radiographic perspectives yielded the most accurate representation. The ability to predict the remaining patellar geometry of the implanted PF joint with radiographic images and SSM, instead of CT, can reduce radiation exposure and streamline in vivo kinematic evaluations.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded
4058,"Leg alignment does not affect tibial baseplate migration at 10 years following total knee arthroplasty INTRODUCTION: Adequate fixation of implant components is an important goal for all arthroplasty procedures, and aseptic loosening is one of the leading causes of revision surgery in total knee arthroplasty [1]. Recent findings supporting a natural ""physiologic varus"" alignment in some patients have launched an ongoing debate in total knee arthroplasty with respect to the optimal position of the implant components [2]. The purpose of the present study was to examine the long-term fixation of a cemented titanium fixed bearing polished tibial baseplate, and examine the effect of alignment on implant migration. Method(s): Patients enrolled in a previous two-year prospective trial were recalled at ten years. While 35 patients were enrolled in the original study, 16 were available for follow-up at 10 years after excluding patients that were deceased (n = 9), unable to attend due to poor health (n = 9), or lost to follow-up (n = 1). All patients underwent total knee arthroplasty by one of three surgeons, receiving a posterior-stabilized CoCr-on-polyethylene implant from a single manufacturer. Each patient underwent radiostereometric analysis (RSA) imaging in a supine position using a conventional RSA protocol at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 10 years post-operatively. Patients also received a three-foot standing x-ray from which leg alignment was measured at the 10-year follow-up. Migration of the tibial component in all planes, measured from RSA, was compared between the 2 year and 10-year follow-up visits. Comparisons of tibial component migration at 10 years between neutral (0 +/- 3 deg) and varus (>3 deg varus) aligned limbs were performed. Outcome scores including the Knee Society Score, WOMAC, SF-12, Forgotten Joint Score, and UCLA Activity Score were recorded. Result(s): At 10 years, the mean migrations of the tibial component were less than 0.1 mm and 0.1 deg in all planes relative to the post-operative RSA exam. There was no significant difference in tibial component migration between the 2 year and 10 year follow-ups, nor was there a significant difference in migration between the neutral and varus limb-aligned groups at 10 years. Tibial component subsidence at 10 years (Figure 1A) was -0.05 +/- 0.15 mm in the neutral group and -0.11 +/- 0.25 mm in the varus limb-aligned group (p = 0.81). The change of tibial component coronal plane alignment at 10 years (Figure IB) was 0.01 +/- 0.14 deg towards valgus in the neutral group and 0.13 +/- 0.38 deg towards varus in the varus limb-aligned group (p =0 .97). There was no correlation between any changes in the position of the tibial component with femoral alignment, tibial alignment, or overall limb alignment. WOMAC and Knee Society Scores were significantly improved (p < 0.0001) at the latest follow-up versus pre-operative scores. There was no significant correlation between implant migration and UCLA Activity Score (r2 = 0.02 to 0.18) or the Forgotten Joint Score (r = 0.01 to 0.34). Discussion(s): The implant was well fixed at 10 years, with no significant difference in migration from the previous two-year follow-up. The excellent long-term fixation of this implant supports the high survivorship for this implant system reported in the literature [3]. Femoral, tibial, and overall limb alignment had no effect on the migration of the tibial baseplate at 10 years follow-up. Both the neutral and varus aligned groups demonstrated minimal change in position of the tibial baseplate overtime.

3953,"Evaluation of a High Concentrated Contrast Media Injection Protocol in Combination with Low Tube Current for Dose Reduction in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: A Randomized, Two-center Prospective Study RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to prospectively evaluate the radiation dose reduction potential and image quality (IQ) of a high-concentration contrast media (HCCM) injection protocol in combination with a low tube current (mAs) in coronary computed tomography angiography., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-one consecutive patients (mean age: 62 years; 34 females; body mass index: 18-31) were included and randomized-assigned into two groups. All computed tomography (CT) examinations were performed in two groups with the same tube voltage (100 kV), flow rate of contrast medium (5.0 mL/s), and iodine dose (22.8 g). An automatic mAs and low concentration contrast medium (300 mgI/mL) were used in group A, whereas effective mAs was reduced by a factor 0.6 along with HCCM (400 mgI/mL) in group B. Radiation dose was assessed (CT dose index [CTDIvol] and dose length product), and vessel-based objective IQ for various regions of interest (enhancement, noise, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio), subjective IQ, noise, and motion artifacts were analyzed overall and vessel-based with a 5-point Likert scale., RESULTS: The CT attenuation of coronary arteries and image noise in group B were significantly higher than those in group A (ranges: 507.5-548.1 Hounsfield units vs 407.5-444.5 Hounsfield units; and 20.3 +/- 8.6 vs 17.7 +/- 8.0) (P <= 0.0166). There was no significant difference between the two groups in signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective IQ of coronary arteries (29.4-31.7, 30.0-37.0, and medium score of 5 in group A vs 29.4-32.4, 27.7-36.3, and medium score of 5 in group B, respectively, P >= 0.1859). Both mean CTDIvol and dose length product in group B were 58% of those of group A., CONCLUSIONS: HCCM combined with low tube current allows dose reduction in coronary computed tomography angiography and does not compromise IQ.

4248,"Single-balloon versus double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures Twenty-eight patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) were treated with single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group A), and 40 patients were treated with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty (Group B). Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, vertebral height, and kyphotic angle (KA) were evaluated pre-operatively, post-operatively (3 days after surgery) and at final follow-up. Operative time, X-ray exposure frequency and costs were recorded. The mean operative time and X-ray exposure frequency in Group A were greater than in Group B (p < 0.05). Significant improvement of the VAS score was noted in each group, and remained unchanged at final follow-up. Mean increases of anterior and middle height of the fractured vertebral body were 5.14 mm and 4.14 mm in Group A, respectively, and 6.22 mm and 5.06 mm in Group B, respectively, and the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Mean reduction of KA was 6.9degree in Group A and 8.8degree in Group B, which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of cement leakage between groups. The mean cost of Group A (US$4202) was significantly less than that of Group B (US$6220) (p < 0.001). Single-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is a safe and cost-effective surgical method for the treatment of OVCF. It can achieve pain relief comparable with double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. However, double-balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is more efficacious in terms of the restoration of vertebral height and reduction of KA, and the operative time and X-ray exposure frequency are lower.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

4246,"Promising clinical outcomes of sequential and ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy in patients with stage IE/IIE extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma Background: The optimal treatment for the rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal-type, has not been clearly defined. The purpose of the study was to investigate the efficacy of sequential and ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in patients with stage IE/IIE extranodal ENKTL, nasal-type. Method(s): One hundred and fifty-five patients with stage IE/IIE nasal-type ENKTL were enrolled in the study, including 99 patients treated with sequential chemotherapy and extended involved-field IMRT (SCRT) and 56 patients with ""Sandwich"" chemotherapy and extended involved-field IMRT and chemotherapy (SCRCT). All patients were treated with extended involved-field IMRT with median dose of 54.6 Gy to the primary tumor and positive lymph nodes. Ninety-four patients had Ann Arbor stage IE disease, and 61 patients had stage IIE disease. Result(s): The 5-year rates of loco-regional recurrence (LRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were 17.0%, 78.5%, and 84.7%, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that EBV DNA copy after treatment (normal vs elevated level) was significant prognostic factor for LRR, PFS, and OS (P < 0.001); therapeutic method (SCRT vs SCRCT) was significant prognostic factor for PFS (71.0% vs 91.8%, P = 0.011), but there was no significant effect on 5-year LRR and OS (22.2% vs 8.2%, P = 0.051 for LRR; 80.9% vs 91.8%, P = 0.199 for OS). Conclusion(s): Compared with SCRT, SCRCT was significantly associated with higher PFS rates and showed a trend toward improved loco-regional control. EBV DNA copy after treatment is a good index for recurrence and prognosis for stage IE/IIE ENKTL patients.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Excluded
3974,"Impact of shoulder deformation on volumetric modulated arc therapy doses for head and neck cancer PURPOSE: When using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for head and neck cancer, setup errors regarding the shoulders can create loss of target coverage or increased organ-at-risk doses. This study created variations of realistic shoulder deformations to understand the associated VMAT dosimetric effects and investigated water-equivalent thickness (WET) differences using in-house software., METHODS: Ten patients with head and neck cancer with lower neck involvement were retrospectively and randomly enrolled. Their retrospective analysis comprised treatment planning using RayStation 5.0 (RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden), shoulder deformation of 5-15mm in three-dimensional axes using the ImSimQA package (Oncology Systems Limited, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, UK), and evaluation of the clinical impact of the dose distribution after recalculating the dose distribution using computed tomography images of deformed shoulders and deforming the dose distribution. Additionally, our in-house software program was used to measure WET differences for shoulder deformation., RESULTS: WET differences were greater in the superoinferior (SI) direction than in the other directions (the WET difference was >20mm for 15-mm SI deformation). D99%, D98%, and D95% for all clinical target volumes were within 3%. Local dose differences of more than +/-10% were found for normal tissues at the level of the shoulder for 15-mm movement in the SI direction., CONCLUSIONS: Shoulder deformation of >6mm could cause large dose variations delivered to the targeted tissue at the level of the shoulder. Thus, to ensure delivery of appropriate treatment coverage to the targeted tissue, shoulder deformation should be taken into consideration during the planning stage.

4013,"Lung cancer screening The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in adults of age 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and are currently smoking or have quit within the past 15 years. This recommendation is largely based on the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial. Both policy-level and clinical decision-making about LDCT screening must consider the potential benefits of screening (reduced mortality from lung cancer) and possible harms. Effective screening requires an appreciation that screening should be limited to individuals at high risk of death from lung cancer, and that the risk of harm related to false positive findings, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary invasive testing is real. A comprehensive understanding of these aspects of screening will inform appropriate implementation, with the objective that an evidence-based and systematic approach to screening will help to reduce the enormous mortality burden of lung cancer.",Excluded
4388,"RAD18 mediates resistance to ionizing radiation in human glioma cells Radioresistance remains a major challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). RAD18 a central regulator of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), has been shown to play an important role in regulating genomic stability and DNA damage response. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between RAD18 and resistance to ionizing radiation (IR) and examined the expression levels of RAD18 in primary and recurrent GBM specimens. Our results showed that RAD18 is an important mediator of the IR-induced resistance in GBM. The expression level of RAD18 in glioma cells correlates with their resistance to IR. Ectopic expression of RAD18 in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells confers significant resistance to IR treatment. Conversely, depletion of endogenous RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells sensitized these cells to IR treatment. Moreover, RAD18 overexpression confers resistance to IR-mediated apoptosis in RAD18-low A172 glioma cells, whereas cells deficient in RAD18 exhibit increased apoptosis induced by IR. Furthermore, knockdown of RAD18 in RAD18-high glioma cells disrupts HR-mediated repair, resulting in increased accumulation of DSB. In addition, clinical data indicated that RAD18 was significantly higher in recurrent GBM samples that were exposed to IR compared with the corresponding primary GBM samples. Collectively, our findings reveal that RAD18 may serve as a key mediator of the IR response and may function as a potential target for circumventing IR resistance in human GBM.

3612,"What is new in the clinic of emphysematous pyelonephritis? INTRODUCTION & OBJECTIVES: Emphysematous pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe, fortunately rare, potentially fatal necrotizing pyelonephritis with a variable clinical presentation, ranging from side pain to septic shock. The majority of cases occur in diabetics with poor glycemic control, while a small percentage may be due to urinary tract obstruction. The disease shows a high mortality rate (19-43%). Escherichia coli is the main causative agent (80%). Diagnosis of EPN should be supported by radiologically. In X Ray, psoas muscle shadow is wiped out in the same side and gas bubble can be observed in renal anatomical locations. Ultrasonograpy is inadequate; intravenous pyelography is not preferable due to the need of contrast material. The best imaging technique is computer tomography (CT) to show renal gas forming and associated tissues. The traditional treatment is parenteral antibiotics treatment and surgical treatment. Surgical treatment including percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) and nephrectomy. In this text, our five patients diagnosed with EPN were evaluated with the reviewing of the present literature. MATERIAL & METHODS: The patients' demographic data, clinical presentation, investigation findings, treatment, and outcome were retrospectively studied. Gas forming was reported in CT for all patients. Urine cultures, white blood cell, sedimentation and C reactive protein levels were collected. We applied a parenteral treatment which consists of ceftriaxone 1 gr 2x1 and metronidazole 500 mg 2x1 for 14 day to all patients. RESULT(S): Our patients consist of three women and two men. The mean age was 62 (range 51-82). Four patients had kidney stone and three of them had second type Diabetes Mellitus as co morbid factors. The most common clinical findings were tachycardia, fever and flank pain. The patients' Urine culture was positive for Escherichia coli with a significant colony count. Radiological examination gave a diagnosis of EPN. While 3 patients were successfully treated by medical therapy alone, 1 had double J stenting according to ureterorenoscopy and 1 had ultrasound-guided PCD. The mean hospitalization period was 16 days (range 14-21). All patients were discharged with recovery. CONCLUSION(S): EPN predominantly affects female diabetics and immunocompromised patients. However, obstruction is another predisposing factor in non diabetic patients. Escherichia coli was found to be the causative organism in all the patients. Treatment comprised of resuscitation, normalization of serum electrolytes and blood sugars, administration of parenteral antibiotics, and relieving ureteric obstruction if present. Only the medical treatment can be a safe strategy in selected cases. Unlike the present literature, we think that EPN is not so mortal disease in today's conditions due to progress in medical care including the early diagnosis and treatment procedures.",Excluded
3736,"Comparative analysis of sialendoscopy, sonography, and CBCT in the detection of sialolithiasis OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The diagnosis of sialolithiasis is, along with clinical presentation, based on different imaging techniques and more invasive procedures such as sialendoscopy. The aim of the study was to analyze the potential of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for the diagnosis of sialolithiasis and to compare the results with those of sonography and sialendoscopy., STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis., METHODS: The data of 43 patients with suspected sialolithiasis were evaluated retrospectively. All patients had CBCT and sonographic imaging and received sialendoscopy to confirm and possibly treat sialolithiasis., RESULTS: Sonography, CBCT, and sialendoscopy together indicated sialolithiasis in 33 patients. The mean maximum diameter of the extracted sialoliths did not significantly differ between the three diagnostics. Each diagnostic tool showed an excellent specificity and positive predictive value. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were best in sialendoscopy (94% resp. 83%), followed by CBCT (79% resp. 56%) and then sonography (70% resp. 47%)., CONCLUSION: The results revealed that CBCT is capable of diagnosing sialoliths in general and tended to be more sensitive than sonography. However, in view of the radiation exposure, the use of CBCT must be critically weighed and should not be used as a primary option., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

3538,"Dose-response relationships for radium-induced bone sarcomas The incidence of bone sarcomas among 3055 female radium-dial workers who entered the dial industry before 1950 was used to determine dose-response relationships for the induction of bone sarcomas by radium. Two subpopulations were analyzed: all measured cases who survived at least 5 yr after the start of employment and all cases who survived at least 2 yr after first measurement. The first constituted a group based on year of entry; it contained 1468 women who experienced 42 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.4. The second comprised a group based on first measurement; it contained 1257 women who experienced 13 bone sarcomas; the expected number was 0.2. The dose-response function, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD, and simplifications of this general form, were fit to each data set. Incidence (I) was in units of bone sarcomas per person-yr; (D) was the quantity (muCi) of radium that entered the blood. Two functions, I = (C + alpha D + beta D2)e-gammaD and I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD, fit the data for year of entry (p greater than or equal to 0.05); both these functions and I = (C + alpha D) fit the data for first measurement. The function I = (C + beta D2)e-gammaD was used to predict the number of bone sarcomas in all other pre-1950 radium cases (medical, laboratory and other exposures); fewer were actually observed than the fit of this function to the female dial workers predicted.",Excluded
3534,"Age assessment by magnetic resonance imaging of the knee: A preliminary study The authors developed an original magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) staging system for epiphyseal fusion of growth plate maturation of the knee and evaluated its reliability and validity for age assessment of living individuals. A total of 290 MRI scans of the knee were reviewed retrospectively in patients aged from 10 to 30 years old (138 males, 152 females). Five original MRI stages were defined to assess the degree of maturation of the distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. Intra-observer variability was excellent and inter-observer variability was good, demonstrating the reliability and the validity of this original MRI staging system. In both sexes, the changes of growth plates (proximal tibial or distal femoral) were associated with age (p < 0.001). Our results agreed with classic data on skeletal maturation of the knee, with globally earlier maturation in females than in males, and also earlier maturation of the proximal tibial epiphysis than of the distal femoral epiphysis. MRI of the knee is an efficient non-invasive method of age assessment, without the disadvantage of X-ray exposure. Further studies with larger groups are needed to support our results. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4332,"Gamma Knife surgery for parasellar meningiomas: long-term results including complications, predictive factors, and progression-free survival OBJECT: Stereotactic radiosurgery serves as an important primary and adjuvant treatment option for patients with many types of intracranial meningiomas. This is particularly true for patients with parasellar meningiomas. In this study, the authors evaluated the outcomes of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) used to treat parasellar meningiomas., METHODS: The study is a retrospective review of the outcomes in 138 patients with meningiomas treated at the University of Virginia from 1989 to 2006; all patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months. There were 31 men and 107 women whose mean age was 54 years (range 19-85 years). Eighty-four patients had previously undergone resection. The mean pre-GKS tumor volume was 7.5 ml (range 0.2-54.8 ml). Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed, and factors related to favorable outcomes in each case were assessed., RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 84 months (median 75.5 months, range 24-216 months). In 118 patients (86%), the tumor volume was unchanged or had decreased at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated radiographic progression-free survival at 5 and 10 years to be 95.4% and 69%, respectively. Fourteen patients (10%) developed new cranial nerve palsies following GKS. Factors associated with tumor control included younger age, a higher isodose, and smaller tumor volume. A longer follow-up duration was associated with either a decrease or increase in tumor volume. Fourteen patients (10%) experienced new or worsening cranial nerve deficits after treatment. Factors associated with this occurrence were larger pretreatment tumor volume, lower peripheral radiation dose, lower maximum dose, tumor progression, and longer follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers an acceptable rate of tumor control for parasellar meningiomas and accomplishes this with a low incidence of neurological deficits. Radiological control after radiosurgery is more likely in those patients with a smaller tumor volume and a higher prescription dose.",Excluded
3522,"Is final TNM staging a predictor for survival in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation therapy? Background: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy has improved the local control rate and overall survival in locally advanced rectal cancers. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the correlation between the final pathologic stage and survival in these patients. Method(s): Patients with biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma, pretreatment staging by magnetic resonance imaging such as T3 or T4 tumors, or node-positive disease were treated with preoperative concomitant 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and radiation, followed by radical surgical resection. Clinical outcome with survival, disease-free survival, recurrence rate, and local recurrence rate were compared with each T and N findings using the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. Result(s): A total of 248 patients were enrolled in this study. Overall survival and disease-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.1, 92, and 89.9% and 87.5, 71.1, and 69.5%, respectively. Thirty-six patients (14.5%) had a pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant therapy. The recurrence rate was significantly different between the pathologic complete response group and residual group (5.6 vs 31.1%; P = .002). Five-year disease-free survival was significantly better in the complete response group than the residual tumor group (93 vs 66%; P = .0045). There was no statistical difference in survival or locoregional recurrence rate between these two groups. Conclusion(s): Posttreatment pathologic TNM stage is correlated to disease-free survival and tumor recurrence rate in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation. Also, pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant treatment has its oncologic benefit in both overall recurrence and disease-free survival. © 2007 Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
4259,"Misdiagnosed male breast cancer with an unknown primary tumor: A case report Compared with female breast cancer, male breast cancer (MBC) has an extremely low morbidity, later staging and fewer breast tissues. The lumps are easier to invade in the center and the majority of the cases are positive for metastatic lymph node, with the typical clinical manifestation as a painless mass in partial breast. MBC with an unknown primary tumor is rare and is often prone to misdiagnosis, resulting in a delay in correct treatment. Such a case is extremely significant for clinical reference. The current study presents a 58-year-old male who developed a painless mass in the left armpit and received armpit mass biopsy and pathological examination which showed glandular cancer, with a high possibility of mammary primary tumor. The patient was administered four cycles of paclitaxel plus oxaliplatin chemotherapy. However, three months later, the patient identified novel disseminated lymph nodes in the left armpit. The initial pathological section and paraffin blocks were re-examined and the patient was finally diagnosed with breast invasive ductal carcinoma based on the metastases pathology and immunohistochemical examination. No breast mass was found on physical examination of the patient and the tumor markers, including cancer antigen 125 and carcinoembryonic antigen, were normal. No primary tumors were observed in the mammography and PET-CT and the primary tumor was not found following the left breast modified radical mastectomy.",Excluded

Comparison was made with rats irradiated with a 1.35 mm wide single beam of similar X-rays. Rats were killed when paresis developed, or up to 383 days post irradiation (dpi)., RESULTS: Microbeam peak/valley doses of =357/12.7 Gy to 715/25.4 Gy to an 11 mm long segment of the spinal cord, or single beam doses of =146-454 Gy to a 1.35 mm long segment caused foreleg paresis and histopathologically verified spinal cord damage; rats exposed to peak/valley doses up to 253/9 Gy were paresis-free at 383 dpi., CONCLUSIONS: Whereas microbeam radiation therapy [MRT] for malignant gliomas implanted in rat brains can be safe, palliative or curative, the high tolerance of normal rat spinal cords to similar microbeam exposures justifies testing MRT for autochthonous malignancies in the central nervous system of larger animals with a view to subsequent clinical applications.

3657,"Growing incidence of thyroid carcinoma in recent years: Factors underlying overdiagnosis There is an increasing incidence of well-differentiated thyroid cancer worldwide. Much of the increase is secondary to increased detection of small, low-risk tumors, with questionable clinical significance. This review addresses the factors that contribute to the increasing incidence and considers environmental, and patient-based and clinician-led influences. Articles addressing the causes of the increased incidence were critically reviewed. A complex interplay of environmental, medical, and social pressures has resulted in increased awareness of the thyroid disease risk, increased screening of thyroid cancers, and increased diagnosis of thyroid cancers. Although there is evidence to suggest that the true disease incidence may be changing slightly, most of the increase is related to factors that promote early diagnosis of low-risk lesions, which is resulting in a significant phenomenon of overdiagnosis. An improved understanding of these pressures at a global level will enable healthcare policymakers to react appropriately to this challenge in the future.Copyright © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Excluded
4462,"Reproducibility of trial-based functional MRI on motor imagery The investigation of the reproducibility in functional MRI (fMRI) is an important step in the quantification and analysis of paradigm-related brain activation. This article reports on reproducibility of cortical activation characterized by repeated fMRI runs (10 times) during the performance of a motor imagery and a passive auditory stimulation as a control task. Two parameters, the size of activation and BOLD signal contrast, were measured from regions-of-interest for 10 subjects across different threshold conditions. The variability of these parameters was normalized with respect to the mean obtained from 10 runs, and represented as the intrasession variability. It was found that the variability was significantly lower in the measurement of BOLD signal contrast as compared to the measurement of the size of activation. The variability of the activation volume measurement was greater in the motor imagery task than in the auditory tasks across all thresholds. This task-dependent difference was not apparent from the measurement of the BOLD signal contrast. The presence of threshold dependence in the variability measurement was also examined, but no such dependency was found. The results suggest that a measurement of BOLD signal itself is a more reliable indicator of paradigm-related brain activation during repeated fMRI scans.",Excluded
3570,"DNA damage and repair of head and neck cancer cells after radio- and chemotherapy DNA repair is critical for successful chemo- and radiotherapy of human tumours, because their genotoxic sensitivity may vary in different types of cancer cells. In this study we have compared DNA damage and the efficiency of its repair after genotoxic treatment with hydrogen peroxide, cisplatin and gamma-radiation of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Lymphocytes and tissue cells from biopsies of 37 cancer patients and 35 healthy donors as well as the HTB-43 larynx cancer cell line were employed. The cell sensitivity to genotoxic treatment was estimated by the MTT survival assay. The extent of DNA damage and efficiency of its repair was examined by the alkaline comet assay. Among the examined treatments, we found that HNSCC cells were the most sensitive to gamma-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. In particular, DNA damage was repaired less effectively in cells from HNSCC metastasis than healthy controls. In conclusion, our results suggest that the different genotoxic sensitivity of HNSCC cells may depend on their DNA repair capacity what in turn may be connected with the effectiveness of head and neck cancer therapy. © 2009 Verlag der Zeitschrift fur Naturforschung, Tubingen.",Included
4537,"Seeds screening aqueous synthesis, multiphase interfacial separation and in situ optical characterization of invisible ultrathin silver nanowires We report a multi-step synthetic method to obtain ultrathin silver nanowires (Ag NWs) from an aqueous solution with a ~17 nm diameter average, and where some of them decreased down to 9 nm. Carefully designed seed screening processes including LED irradiation at high temperature for a short time, and then continuous H2O2 etching, and relative growth mechanisms of high-yield five-twinned pentagonal seeds and ultrathin Ag NWs in aqueous environment are detailed. Then, a rapid and simple multiphase interfacial assembly method particularly suitable for the separation of ultrathin Ag NWs from various by-products was demonstrated with a clear mechanism explanation. Next, a unique optical interaction between light and individual AG NWs, as well as feature structures in the AG NWs film, was investigated by a micro-domain optical confocal microscope measurement in situ together with a theoretical explanation using modal transmission theory. That revealed that the haze problem of AG NWs films was not only arising from the interaction between light and individual or crossed Ag NWs but was also greatly dependent on a weak coupling effect of leaky modes supported by adjacent Ag NWs with large distances which had not been considered before. We then provided direct experimental evidence and concluded how to obtain haze-free films with 100% transparency in the whole visible range based on ultrathin Ag NWs. This breakthrough in diameter confinement and purification of Ag NWs is a highly expected step to overcome the well-focused light diffusion and absorption problems of Ag NWs-based devices applied in various fields such as flexible electronics, high-clarity displays, visible transparent heaters, photovoltaics and various optoelectronic technologies.",Excluded
3593,"[Plaque radiotherapy for anterior uveal melanomas] AIM: To determine the effectiveness of plaque radiation therapy for anterior uveal melanomas and to evaluate the risk and frequency of complications at different time intervals after the treatment., MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 2010-2013 a total of 30 patients (10 male, 20 female) aged 11-73 (50 years on the average) with iris or iridociliary melanomas were treated with Ru-106 and Sr-90 ophthalmic plaques. In 8 patients the brachytherapy was preceded by local tumor excision. Morphological diagnosis was verified in 10 patients (8 iridectomies, 2 enucleations), of them 8 cases turned out to be spindle cell melanomas and the other 2--mixed cell melanomas. Follow-up period ranged from 1 to 54 months with the median of 13,5 months., RESULTS: Tumor regression was achieved in all cases. Enucleation had to be performed in 2 patients due to cornea and sclera necrosis. In the early post-brachytherapy period (up to 1 month) the most frequent radiation-related complications were keratopathy and uveitis (8 and 6 patients correspondingly). In patients observed for up to 3 months (28 patients) these were keratopathy and cataract (8 and 5 patients correspondingly). In the long-term (over 6 months) cataract predominated (17 patients). At the end of the study all patients were alive. Metastatic disease was diagnosed in one patient 30 months after the treatment., CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present clinical study confirm the effectiveness of brachytherapy for iris and iridociliary melanomas, which implies that tumor is well locally controlled and radiation-related complications are moderate and curable. This method of local tumor destruction can be another alternative to enucleation in cases when local tumor excision cannot be performed.",Excluded
4209,"Factors determining fluoroscopy time during ureteroscopy Purpose: The aim of this study was to prospectively identify predictors of radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. Patients and Methods: Eighty-five consecutive patients who presented for ureteroscopies and laser lithotripsy were considered. Fluoroscopy time (FT) was obtained from radiology reports for each patient, and clinical data were obtained from chart review. Nine patients were excluded (three unconfirmed FTs, four staghorn calculi, one ectopic kidney, and one multiple ureteral strictures). Seventy-six patients were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate linear regression were used to identify factors that determined FT. Result(s): The patient cohort was 65.8% male with a mean age of 52.7 years. Mean FT was 183s, and mean surgical time was 68.4+/-29 minutes. Mean stone size was 10+/-5mm in the greatest dimension. A large proportion of patients (50%) had renal stones, multiple stones were present in 31.6% of cases, and 22.3% of stones were radiolucent. Cases were equally distributed between surgeons A and B, and 46% of patients had preoperative stents. On multivariate analysis, increased FT was independently associated with surgeon A (104 additional seconds per case, P<0.001), longer duration of surgery (14s per 10 minutes, P<0.001), and male patients (54s per procedure, P=0.02). Age, stone characteristics, presence of ureteral stent, and stone-free status did not correlate with FT. Conclusion(s): Surgeon behavior, longer duration of surgery, and male gender were significant predictors of FT and, hence, radiation exposure during ureteroscopy. In the present study, stone characteristics were not found to be predictors of FT. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Excluded

We obtained the data on solar, geomagnetic radiovawe propagation, ionosphere ionization hours, proton flux of two energy levels (>90 and 60 MeV) from the National Geophysical Data Center at Goddard Space Flight Center, National Space Environment Center at Boulder, Colorado, USA, and from the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation (IZMIRAN), Russia. We calculated Pearson coefficients and their probabilities for correlation between monthly space activity level and monthly number of male and female deaths from different causes. Cosmic rays activity revealed significant negative correlation with solar/geomagnetic activity indices and related physical phenomena levels. This activity strongly correlated with flux of protons with the energies >90 MeV proton flux and did not exhibit significant correlation with 60 MeV proton fluxes. Cosmic rays intensity correlation with monthly numbers of deaths was strong for noncardiovascular deaths, suicides, and traffic accidents. The correlation was much weaker for deaths caused by ishemic heart disease and strokes.",Excluded
3909,"A comparison of leg length discrepancy with function and satisfaction scores after cemented total hip replacement Introduction: Total Hip replacement (THR) is considered an effective surgical intervention for the relief of chronic pain and functional disability. However, a proportion of patients experience a poor outcome. Leg length discrepancy (LLD) can be introduced, or not corrected, at the time of operation. Previous research has shown that patients with LLD reported a lower functional outcome than those with equal leg lengths. We report on a cohort of 146 patients with a minimum of 3-year follow-up who underwent cemented total hip replacement. We have compared the data when looking at independent variables including age, sex, BMI, femoral head size, offset of stem, grade of surgeon, surgical approach and cup type. Material(s) and Method(s): 146 patients were followed up for a mean of 3.66 years (range 3.25-4.5 years). There were 96 females and 45 males. The mean age at surgery was 77 years (range 50-95 years). All patients were reviewed in clinic or contacted by postal survey for assessment of function and satisfaction. The pre-operative X-rays were compared with early post-operative X-rays. LLD was assessed radiologically according to the method of Woolson, as modified by Konyves and Bannister, on plain sequential AP pelvis radiographs by 2 independent observers. Result(s): Mean LLD was 2 mm (range -10 mm to +14 mm). No significant association was found for the above independent variables. The overall stem alignment was satisfactory. A non-significant reduction in function (measured by oxford hip score, SF- 12 and satisfaction score) was noted in association with LLD of greater than 5 mm. Discussion(s): We report radiological LLD after cemented THR. This has previously been reported as being linked to function. We found a non-significant correlation between reported function and satisfaction with LLD. However 94% of our observed limb lengths were within 1 cm of the other side. There was no significant association between LLD and other independent variables.",Excluded
3871,"Benefits for bone from resistance exercise and nutrition in long-duration spaceflight: Evidence from biochemistry and densitometry Exercise has shown little success in mitigating bone loss from long-duration spaceflight. The first crews of the International Space Station (ISS) used the ""interim resistive exercise device"" (iRED), which allowed loads of up to 297 lb(f) (or 1337 N) but provided little protection of bone or no greater protection than aerobic exercise. In 2008, the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED), which allowed absolute loads of up to 600 lb(f) (1675 N), was launched to the ISS. We report dietary intake, bone densitometry, and biochemical markers in 13 crewmembers on ISS missions from 2006 to 2009. Of these 13, 8 had access to the iRED and 5 had access to the ARED. In both groups, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase tended to increase during flight toward the end of the mission (p = 0.06) and increased 30 days after landing (p < 0.001). Most markers of bone resorption were also increased in both groups during flight and 30 days after landing (p < 0.05). Bone densitometry revealed significant interactions (time and exercise device) for pelvis bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (p < 0.01), hip femoral neck BMD (p < 0.05), trochanter BMD (p < 0.05), and total hip BMD (p < 0.05). These variables were unchanged from preflight only for ARED crewmembers, who also returned from flight with higher percent lean mass and lower percent fat mass. Body mass was unchanged after flight in both groups. All crewmembers had nominal vitamin D status (75 +/- 17 nmol/L) before and during flight. These data document that resistance exercise, coupled with adequate energy intake (shown by maintenance of body mass determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) and vitamin D, can maintain bone in most regions during 4- to 6-month missions in microgravity. This is the first evidence that improving nutrition and resistance exercise during spaceflight can attenuate the expected BMD deficits previously observed after prolonged missions.

3940,"Mortality among individuals exposed to atomic bomb radiation in utero: 1950-2012 We examined the mortality risks among 2463 individuals who were exposed in utero to atomic bomb radiation in Hiroshima or Nagasaki in August 1945 and were followed from October 1950 through 2012. Individual estimates of mother's weighted absorbed uterine dose (DS02R1) were used. Poisson regression method was used to estimate the radiation-associated excess relative risk per Gy (ERR/Gy) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cause-specific mortality. Head size, birth weight, and parents' survival status were evaluated as potential mediators of radiation effect. There were 339 deaths (216 males and 123 females) including deaths from solid cancer (n = 137), lymphohematopoietic cancer (n = 8), noncancer disease (n = 134), external cause (n = 56), and unknown cause (n = 4). Among males, the unadjusted ERR/Gy (95% CI) was increased for noncancer disease mortality (1.22, 0.10-3.14), but not for solid cancer mortality (- 0.18, < - 0.77-0.95); the unadjusted ERR/Gy for external cause mortality was not statistically significant (0.28, < - 0.60-2.36). Among females, the unadjusted ERRs/Gy were increased for solid cancer (2.24, 0.44-5.58), noncancer (2.86, 0.56-7.64), and external cause mortality (2.57, 0.20-9.19). The ERRs/Gy adjusted for potential mediators did not change appreciably for solid cancer mortality, but decreased notably for noncancer mortality (0.39, < - 0.43-1.91 for males; 1.48, - 0.046-4.55 for females) and external cause mortality (0.10, < - 0.57-1.96 for males; 1.38, < - 0.46-5.95 for females). In conclusion, antenatal radiation exposure is a consistent risk factor for increased solid cancer mortality among females, but not among males. The effect of exposure to atomic bomb radiation on noncancer disease and external cause mortality among individuals exposed in utero was mediated through small head size, low birth weight, and parental loss.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).",Excluded
4569,"Patient-Centered Outcomes Related to Imaging Testing in US Primary Care Background: Imaging tests are one of the most sophisticated types of diagnostic tools used in health care, yet there are concerns that imaging is overused. Currently, tests are typically evaluated and implemented based on their accuracy, and there is limited knowledge about the range of patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) that imaging tests may lead to. This study explores patients' experiences and subsequent outcomes of imaging tests most notable to patients. Method(s): Adult patients from four primary care clinics who had an x-ray, CT, MRI, or ultrasound in the 12 months before recruitment participated in a single semistructured interview to recount their imaging experience. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. Result(s): Four themes related to PCOs were identified from 45 interviews. Participants' mean age was 53 years (25-83 years), 30 had undergone a diagnostic imaging test, and 15 underwent imaging for screening or monitoring. Themes included knowledge gained from the imaging test, its contribution to their overall health care journey, physical experiences during the test procedure, and impacts of the testing process on emotions. Conclusion(s): Patients identified various imaging test outcomes that were important to them. Measurement and reporting these outcomes should be considered more often in diagnostic research. Tools for providers and patients to discuss and utilize these outcomes may help promote shared decision making around the use and impact of imaging tests.Copyright © 2018",Excluded
3825,"A novel strategy of radiofrequency hyperthermia (neothermia) in combination with preoperative chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of advanced rectal cancer: A pilot study The safety of weekly regional hyperthermia performed with 8 MHz radiofrequency (RF) capacitive heating equipment has been established in rectal cancer. We aimed to standardize hyperthermia treatment for scientific evaluation and for assessing local tumor response to RF hyperthermia in rectal cancer. Forty-nine patients diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma were included in the study. All patients received chemoradiation with intensity-modulated radiation therapy 5 days/week (dose, 50 Gy/25 times) concomitant with 5 days/week for five times of capecitabine (1700 mg/m2 per day) and once a week for five times of 50 min irradiations by an 8 MHz RF capacitive heating device. Thirty-three patients underwent surgery 8 weeks after treatment. Three patients did not undergo surgery because of progressive disease (PD) and 13 refused. Eight (16.3%) patients had a pathological complete response (ypCR) after surgery. Among patients without surgery, 3 (6.1%) had clinical complete response (CR) and 3 (6.1%) had local CR but distant PD (CRPD). Ninety percent of ypCR + CR patients were shown in 6.21 W min-1 m-2/treatment or higher group of average total accumulated irradiation output with 429degreeC min-1 m-2 or higher group of total accumulated thermal output. However, a patient with CRPD was in the higher total accumulated thermal output group. We propose a new quantitative parameter for the hyperthermia and demonstrated that patients can benefit from mild irradiation with mild temperature. Using these parameters, the exact output, optimal thermal treatment, and contraindications or indications of this modality could be determined in a multi-institutional, future study.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.",Excluded

4048,"Spine stereotactic body radiotherapy for renal cell cancer spinal metastases: Analysis of outcomes and risk of vertebral compression fracture Object. The aim of this study was to evaluate local control (LC) and the risk of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in patients with renal cell cancer spinal metastases. Methods. Prospectively collected data on 71 spinal segments treated with SBRT in 37 patients were reviewed. The median follow-up was 12.3 months (range 1.2-55.4 months). The LC rate was assessed based on each spinal segment treated and overall survival (OS) according to each patient treated. Sixty of 71 segments (85%) were radiation naive, 11 of 71 (15%) were previously irradiated, and 10 of 71 (14%) were treated with postoperative SBRT. The median SBRT total dose and number of fractions were 24 Gy and 2, respectively. The VCF analysis also included evaluation of the Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score criteria. Results. The 1-year OS and LC rates were 64% and 83%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified oligometastatic disease (13 of 37 patients) as a positive prognostic factor (p = 0.018) for OS. Of 61 non-postoperative spinal segments treated, 10 (16%) developed VCFs; 3 of 10 were de novo VCFs and 7 of 10 occurred as progression of an existing VCF. The 1-year VCF-free probability rate was 82%. Multivariate analysis identified single-fraction SBRT and baseline VCF as significant predictors of SBRT-induced VCF (p = 0.028 and p = 0.012, respectively). Conclusions. Spine SBRT yields high rates of local tumor control in patients with renal cell cancer. Baseline VCF and 18-24 Gy delivered in a single fraction were predictive of further collapse. Patients with oligometastatic disease may benefit most from such aggressive local therapy, given the prolonged survival observed.Copyright © AANS, 2014.",Excluded
4348,"Dissecting the hematopoietic microenvironment. V: limitations of repair following damage to the hematopoietic support stroma Damage and repair of the hematopoietic microenvironment of the spleen was studied using X-irradiation, anoxic necrosis induced by splenic ligation, or a combination of the two, as the destructive agents. Spleen colony number, size and type, 59Fe uptake, and microscopic study of splenic structure were used as means of assessment. The most severe or least repaired damage was induced by high dose irradiation (4000 r), by 1000 r followed immediately by splenic ligation, and by two successive splenic ligations separated by a 30 day recovery period. It was seen that reduction of CFUs lodgment, as measured by f factor, played a very major role in the lesser number of spleen colonies formed after either kind of damage. Following the several treatments, the numbers of spleen colonies formed, their size and their typing as erythrocytic or granulocytic varied independently of each other, suggesting that these functions of the microenvironment, and the cell types responsible for them, are independent of each other. The exhaustion of regenerative capacity displayed by repeatedly ligated spleens suggested a maximal limit for stromal cell replications commensurate with Hayflick's hypothesis.",Excluded
4146,"Heliotherapy improves vitamin D balance and atopic dermatitis BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency during winter is common in the Nordic countries. Heliotherapy (HT) may heal atopic dermatitis (AD) but its effect on vitamin D balance has not been examined., OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of HT on serum calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D) concentration and on healing of AD., METHODS: Twenty-three adult patients with AD received a 2-week course of HT in the Canary Islands in either January or March 2005. Daily solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation was measured and personal UV exposure calculated as standard erythema doses (SED). Blood samples were taken during HT and during a 1-2 month follow-up. Serum calcidiol concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Healing of AD was examined by SCORAD index., RESULTS: Before HT 17 (74%) AD patients had vitamin D insufficiency (calcidiol < 50 nmol L(-1)) and four patients high (> 80 nmol L(-1)) serum calcidiol values. The median personal UV dose during the 2-week HT course was 60 SED in the January group and 109 SED in the March group. Serum calcidiol concentration increased significantly in both groups, by 13.4 and 24.0 nmol/L(-1), respectively, and after HT only four (17%) patients had vitamin D insufficiency. SCORAD improved from 34 to 9 in the January HT group and from 30 to 9 in the March group., CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week course of HT significantly improved vitamin D balance by increasing serum calcidiol concentration, and caused a marked healing of AD. These parallel positive responses should be taken into account when the benefits of HT are considered.",Excluded
4461,"The use of autologous platelet and plasma products in salvage neck dissections: a prospective clinical study evaluating early and late wound healing OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of autologous platelet and plasma adhesives (APA) on postoperative drainage and soft-tissue fibrosis following neck dissections., DESIGN: This was a blinded comparative prospective cohort study done as two parts: part one evaluated early post-surgical outcomes and part two evaluated late tissue fibrosis., METHOD: Salvage neck dissections were stratified into two groups based on severity of prior treatment. High risk patients were defined as those who had previously undergone chemoradiation therapy and autologous platelet adhesives were administered to the surgical wound intraoperatively. The low risk group consisted of patients undergoing salvage neck dissections following radiation only and acted as controls. Part one evaluated postsurgical wound drainage as the primary outcome as well as length of hospital stay and complications. Part two evaluated late postoperative tissue fibrosis by comparing neck skin using the Cutometer. R2 and F0 were the specific Cutometer parameters for quantifying the viscoelastic properties of the skin., RESULTS: Postoperative wound drainage was significantly less (253.7 vs. 345.8) in the autologous platelet adhesive group as compared to the control group (p less than 0.03). Length of stay in the APA group versus the control group was 3.13 and 3.86 days respectively (p less than 0.004). Both R2 and F0 measurements showed improved viscoelastic properties of the skin in the APA group (R2 p less than 0.05, F0 p less than 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: APA application following salvage neck dissections may reduce early postperative wound drainage and improve long-term skin quality.",Excluded
3876,"Radon testing in rapid access lung clinics: an opportunity for secondary prevention Background: Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas and a level 1 carcinogen. It acts synergistically with cigarette smoke to cause lung cancer. In Ireland, radon is estimated to be associated with 13 % of all lung cancers. Rapid access lung cancer clinics (RALC's) were established in the UK and Ireland to improve lung cancer management outcomes. There has been no attempt to date to provide advice on household radon exposure assessments in this setting. Aim(s): We performed a prospective feasibility study of radon assessment in our RALC to test the hypothesis that patients would avail of this service and that it would provide an opportunity for secondary prevention in at risk persons. Method(s): We investigated household radon levels in consecutive patients who were newly referred with symptoms of lung cancer to the RALC in Galway University Hospital, Ireland over a 6-month period. Result(s): Of 50 patients enrolled, 42 returned valid results. Overall 21 % of patients had radon levels recorded above the national reference level. Only 5 % of patients were aware of the association between radon gas and lung cancer. Smokers were significantly less likely to engage fully in radon testing. Conclusion(s): The development of RALC's offers a novel opportunity to integrate the concepts of radon exposure, cigarette smoking and the development of lung cancer, and to reinforce this message in the minds of at risk patients.Copyright © 2016, Royal Academy of Medicine in Ireland.",Excluded
4296,"Host and tumor immunity: Local and systemic opportunities to enhance tumor curability by radiotherapy Success of radiation treatment depends on intrinsic properties of tumor cells, involvement of the host immune system and the crosstalk between tumor and host cells in primary and secondary (metastatic) sites. During the last decade our laboratory has investigated the role of these interactions in the ability of radiotherapy to eradicate primary tumors and metastatic disease. In the current presentation we will focus on host factors which interact with ionizing radiation (IR). The results of our studies using genetic models and specific immunological probes have identified CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, professional antigen presenting cells (CD11c+ dendritic cells), local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and host Type I Interferons (IFNs) as required for successful treatment by radiation 1,2. Transformation of the tumor microenvironment into an ""immunological hub"" to suppress local and distant disease is a tantalizing goal for which radiotherapy might be well suited, especially in combination with immunotherapy. , Our group has recently demonstrated that the combination of radiotherapy and anti-PD-L1 antibodies decrease accumulation and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells(CD11b,Gr1+) through enhanced local production of TNFalpha by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs). in experimental systems3,4 The capacity of local radiotherapy to augment the activation TILs and drive cytokine production is, in part, due to the ability to increase tumor antigen cross-presentation by professional antigen presenting cells in the tumor stroma. Our group demonstrated host type I IFNs are essential for enhanced tumor antigen cross-presentation following radiotherapy. The critical role of type I IFNs in the host immune response to radiotherapy positions them as central components in the crosstalk between tumor cells and the host that can exert positive or negative influences depending on the context. In particular, the interaction of tumor cells with the host leads to the selection of clones resistant to the cytotoxic effects of IFNs and radiotherapy. Using transcriptomic approaches we identified a set of Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) associated with tumor radioresistance.5 This gene set was identified in different types of primary tumors (lung, prostate, breast and glioblastoma) and termed the Interferon Related DNA Damage Signature (IRDS). Statistical training of this gene set detected a 7 gene signature which predicted response to adjuvant radio/chemotherapy for some woman with breast cancer 6. The IRDS is prognostic for patients with subsets of glioma and prostate cancer. We propose that these data indicate the presence of pro-survival genes in the IFN/Jak/Stat axis, which has been confirmed recently through a genomics approach The Jak-Stat pathway is currently under investigation as a potential therapeutic target for radio-chemosensitization in different tumor types. Our current approaches are directed towards identification of tumor ISGs with pro-survival/radioprotective functions. These results demonstrate the requirement to investigate both tumor and the host to improve the therapeutic ratio in radiotherapy.",Excluded
3675,"Normal tissue complication probability modeling for cochlea constraints to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy Background: Radiation-induced tinnitus is a side effect of radiotherapy in the inner ear for cancers of the head and neck. Effective dose constraints for protecting the cochlea are under-reported. The aim of this study is to determine the cochlea dose limitation to avoid causing tinnitus after head-and-neck cancer (HNC) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Method(s): In total 211 patients with HNC were included; the side effects of radiotherapy were investigated for 422 inner ears in the cohort. Forty-nine of the four hundred and twenty-two samples (11.6%) developed grade 2+ tinnitus symptoms after IMRT, as diagnosed by a clinician. The Late Effects of Normal Tissues-Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic (LENT-SOMA) criteria were used for tinnitus evaluation. The logistic and Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models were used for the analyses. Result(s): The NTCP-fitted parameters were TD 50 = 46.31Gy (95% CI, 41.46-52.50),GAMMA 50 = 1.27 (95% CI, 1.02-1.55), and TD 50 = 46.52Gy (95% CI, 41.91-53.43), m = 0.35 (95% CI, 0.30-0.42) for the logistic and LKB models, respectively. The suggested guideline TD 20 for the tolerance dose to produce a 20% complication rate within a specific period of time was TD 20 = 33.62Gy (95% CI, 30.15-38.27) (logistic) and TD 20 = 32.82Gy (95% CI, 29.58-37.69) (LKB). Conclusion(s): To maintain the incidence of grade 2+ tinnitus toxicity <20% in IMRT, we suggest that the mean dose to the cochlea should be <32Gy. However, models should not be extrapolated to other patient populations without further verification and should first be confirmed before clinical implementation.Copyright © 2015 Lee et al.",Excluded
4431,"Radionuclide therapy in cancer patients with bone metastases Aim: We submit our experience in the application of radionuclides for therapy of bone metastases of cancer patients with different foci of appearance of the cancer process: breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer and others. Material(s) and Method(s): In 167 patients with bone metastases we used 32-P in 71 patients and 89-Sr in 96 patients. 93 are women and 74 are men; 90 women are with cancer of the breast, 52- with prostate cancer, 24 are with lung cancer and 1 with renal cell carcinoma. All patients are observed for side effects when an application of a radiopharmaceutical is done-32-P per os and 89-Sr intravenous, as well as for the changes of haemoglobin, leucocyte and thrombocyte count. Result(s): One months after the radionuclide therapy we observed a significant reduction of the leucocyte and thrombocyte count in the group accepted 32-P (t = 3.83, p < 0.05; t = 5.29, p < 0.001). For the group, where 89-Sr is applied we did not calculate statistically significant decrease of the tested indicators mentioned above. At the same time the basic reason for which the radionuclides are applied- pain, decreases in intensity and patients return to their normal activity.This is more typical for patients with cancer of the breast and prostate cancer. Discussion(s): The serious symptom 'pain' is influenced by the not so high applied activity of 2 mCi of 32-P speaks in favour of the use of this radiophar-maceutic, although there is a resistance among authors of its application with regard to myelosuppression. According to our observations it is light, the blood indicators restore quickly even without special therapy and patients can take the advantage of this additional method to overcome pain syndrome. The intravenous applicaton of 89-Sr in activity of 4 mCi also influences pain in a very good way, but the price per patient is high and all patients wait for an reimbursement from the health insurance. This is a significant factor for wider use. The use of 32-P is cheaper but the delivery stopped and for the moment we can use only 89-Sr. Conclusion(s): The application of 32-P and 89-Sr is additional possibility for the treatment of pain due to bone metastases of cancer patients- easy and effective especially for those that are not treated effectively after local irradiation. The myelosuppressive effect is not statistically significant and both isotopes can be used successfully in the treatment of pain in cancer patients.",Excluded
4110,"Late temporal lobe necrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: evaluation with combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging Late temporal lobe necrosis is a well-known and serious complication in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) following radiotherapy. Owing to the close proximity to the skull base, the medial temporal lobes are inevitably included in the target volume of irradiation. Patients with NPC provide a unique opportunity in study of delay radiation effect in normal human brain. The objective of this study was to evaluate late temporal lobe radiation injury by combined multi-section diffusion weighted and perfusion weighted MR imaging. We prospectively studied 16 patients with typical clinical symptoms of late temporal lobe necrosis or other abnormalities in the temporal lobes incidentally detected by conventional MR imaging. All patients had a previous history of radiotherapy for histologically proven NPC. Conventional T1- and T2-weighted images, fast gradient echo with echo-planar diffusion-weighted and perfusion-weighted MR imaging were performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) map were computed via commercially available software. MR diffusion and perfusion images were then analyzed and graded by two independent observers with focusing on the diffusion and perfusion mismatch. The temporal lobe lesions displayed marked high diffusion on the ADC map. The rCBV map also revealed marked hypoperfusion in these temporal lobe lesions in all patients. The areas of abnormality on the rCBV map were significantly larger than the lesions on the ADC map in 14 patients (observer 1) and 13 patients (observer 2). Since late temporal lobe necrosis is probably caused by damage of the endothelium of vessels and ischemia, perfusion and diffusion mismatch might imply injured tissue but potentially salvageable brain tissue. A mismatch may be potentially used to predict the response to treatment in-patients with late temporal lobe necrosis.",Excluded
4164,"18 Years' experience with high dose rate strontium-90 brachytherapy of small to medium sized posterior uveal melanoma Aim: To analyse local tumour control, radiation related complications, visual acuity, enucleation rate, and survival after brachytherapy of small to medium sized choroidal melanoma (CM) with a high dose rate (HDR) strontium-90 (Sr-90) applicator. Method(s): From 1983 until 2000, 98 eyes with CM were treated with Sr-90 brachytherapy. The main outcome measures were actuarial rates of the patients' survival, ocular conservation rate, tumour regression, complication rates, and preservation of visual acuity. End point rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Result(s): The median follow up time was 6.7 years (0.5-18.8 years). Actuarial melanoma free patient survival rate was 85% (SE 4.8%) after 18 years. Actuarial rate of ocular conservation and complete tumour regression was 90% (SE 3.8%) after 15 years. In 93% local tumour control was achieved, 88% showed a stable scar. Recurrence of the tumour on the border caused enucleation of six eyes (7%). In three cases (4%) retinal detachment was the end point. No cases of optic atrophy or of sight impairing retinopathy outside the treated area were found. Actuarial rate of preservation of visual acuity of 1/10 was 65% at 5 years and 45% at 15 years of follow up (SE 5.9% and 8.8%). Conclusion(s): Sr-90 brachytherapy is as effective as iodine or ruthenium brachytherapy for small to medium sized CM but causes fewer complications. The preservation of vision is better than with all other described radioisotopes. HDR Sr-90 brachytherapy can therefore safely be recommended for small to medium sized CM.",Excluded

Method(s): Time-resolved non-contrast-enhanced images of the lungs were acquired prospectively in 15patients using a 2D balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequence. After non-rigid registrationof the native image data, perfusion-weighted images were calculated by separating periodic changes oflung proton density at the cardiac frequency using FD. DCE MRI subtraction datasets were acquired asstandard of reference. Both datasets were analyzed visually for perfusion defects. Then segmentationanalyses were performed to describe perfusion of pulmonary lobes semi-quantitatively as percent-ages of total lung perfusion. Overall FD MRI perfusion signal was compared to velocity-encoded flowmeasurements in the pulmonary trunk as an additional fully quantitative reference. Result(s): Image quality ratings of FD MRI were significantly inferior to those of DCE MRI (P < 0.0001).Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of FD MRI for visual detection of perfusion defects were 84%, 92%,and 91%. Semi-quantitative evaluation of lobar perfusion provided high agreement between FD MRI andDCE MRI for both entire lungs and upper lobes, but less agreement in the lower parts of both lungs. FDperfusion signal showed high linear correlation with pulmonary arterial blood flow. Conclusion(s): FD MRI is a promising technique that allows for assessing regional lung perfusion in NSCLCpatients without contrast media or ionizing radiation. However, for being applied in clinical routine,image quality and robustness of the technique need to be further improved. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3964,"Radiation esophagitis in the treatment for lung cancer We retrospectively studied the 62 patients with primary lung cancer (56 males and 6 females) who were admitted to our department from January 1990 to December 1996. They were treated with radiation therapy (twice daily) for the chest, including the esophagus. The total radiation dose was 55.6Gy (mean). Esophagitis occurred in 48 patients (77%) after 29.7Gy (mean) of radiation. The symptoms of esophagitis included pharyngeal or chest pain, especially during swallowing. The incidence of esophagitis in the patients (n=46) who received chemotherapy before radiation was significantly higher than that in the patients (n=16) who did not receive it (87% vs. 50%; p<0.05). Esophagitis occurred in 22 (81%) among 27 patients who were given the preventive medicine. In spite of the optimal or supplemental administration of mucosal coating agents, esophagitis improved only in six patients (12%). Severe esophagitis was also observed in some patients, including two patients whose irradiation was terminated and one patient who was treated with intravenous hyperalimentation. Although radiation esophagitis is a very common complication in the treatment for lung cancer, it is refractory to usual treatments. Consequently, it is necessary to develop more effective prophylactic and treatment methods for radiation esophagitis.",Excluded
3504,"Diagnostic accuracy of high-definition CT coronary angiography in high-risk patients Aim To assess the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) using a combination of high-definition CT (HD-CTCA) and high level of reader experience, with invasive coronary angiography (ICA) as the reference standard, in high-risk patients for the investigation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Materials and methods Three hundred high-risk patients underwent HD-CTCA and ICA. Independent experts evaluated the images for the presence of significant CAD, defined primarily as the presence of moderate (>=50%) stenosis and secondarily as the presence of severe (>=70%) stenosis in at least one coronary segment, in a blinded fashion. HD-CTCA was compared to ICA as the reference standard. Results No patients were excluded. Two hundred and six patients (69%) had moderate and 178 (59%) had severe stenosis in at least one vessel at ICA. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 97.1%, 97.9%, 99% and 93.9% for moderate stenosis, and 98.9%, 93.4%, 95.7% and 98.3%, for severe stenosis, on a per-patient basis. Conclusion The combination of HD-CTCA and experienced readers applied to a high-risk population, results in high diagnostic accuracy comparable to ICA. Modern generation CT systems in experienced hands might be considered for an expanded role.Copyright © 2015 The Royal College of Radiologists.",Excluded
3648,"The addition of induction chemotherapy with etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin failed to improve therapeutic outcome of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer - Single institution retrospective analysis Although chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the optimal sequencing remains to be determined. We retrospectively compared the treatment results of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent CRT (induction group, 32 patients) with those of concurrent CRT alone (concurrent group, 41 patients) in unresectable stage IIIA/IIIB NSCLC patients. In induction group, 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (etoposide/ifosfamide/cisplatin: 24 patients, others: 8 patients) were followed by concurrent CRT (60 Gy/30 fractions, 6 mg/m 2 of cisplatin daily), while the same concurrent CRT was administered in concurrent group. Clinicopathologic characteristics including age, weight loss, histologic types, and clinical stage did not show significant differences between two groups except for a higher proportion of patients with ECOG performance status 2 in concurrent group (3% vs. 27%, p=0.015). Overall toxicity was generally acceptable with 1 treatment-related death from tracheoesophageal fistula in induction group. The response rates after concurrent CRT were 41% for induction group and 54% for concurrent group, which showed no significant difference (p=0.560). With median follow-up of 13 (1-92) months, there was a trend toward an advantage for concurrent group in median progression-free survival (6 months vs 8.3 months, p=0.067) and overall survival (12 months vs. 14.5 months, p=0.059). In multivariate analysis, only more than 10% weight loss within 6 months was significantly associated with poor survival (p=0.001). In conclusion, the addition of induction chemotherapy to concurrent CRT did not show any advantage over concurrent CRT alone in locally advanced NSCLC.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): From November 2010 to November 2015, 17 patients who met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. There were 12 men and 5 women with a median age of 56 years (range 24-83 years). There were 10 lung carcinomas, 4 esophagus carcinomas , 1 liver cancer, 1 breast cancer, and 1 kidney carcinoma . 6 had squamous cell carcinoma, 8 were adenocarcinoma, 3 others respectively. All patients suffered varying degrees of pain before seed implantation, ranging from 1 to 9 on the NRS. Mean NRS scores before implantation was 6.88 +/- 2.25 respectively. Regarding neurologic function, 2 grade Bs, 2 grade Cs, 3 grade Ds and 10 grade Es. All patients with recurrent spinal bone metastases had received conventional EBRT. During the procedure, patients remained in a prone position to facilitate CT guidance. We measured the pedicle angle and the distance of the puncture point. The depth of the puncture point to the pedicle was also borne in mind. Needles were inserted through the anterior portion of the lateral images, in the interval between the pedicle and the vertebral body, or with a pedicle or paraspinal approach, respectively. Seeds were implanted 1.0 cm from the spinal cord, to minimize radiation damage. Immediately after the procedure, a CT scan was obtained to confirm the location of the seeds in case of any need for supplementary implantation. The number of 125I seeds implanted ranged from 18 to 62 (median 30) with specific activity of 0.5-0.8 mCi (median 0.75 mCi). The post-plan showed that the actuarial D90 of 125I seeds were 60.5-154 Gy(median 106 Gy). The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 59 months (median 7 months). The local control rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Result(s): For all patients, the 1-,2-year overall survival rates were 74.8%, 49.8%, respectively, with a median of 15 months (range, 1-59 months), the 1-, 2-year local control rates were 54.1%, 36.1%, respectively, with a median of 14 months (range, 1-59 months). During the follow-up period, 5.9% (1/17) died from metastases, 5.9% (1/17) died from developed local recurrence,11.8% (2/17) died from primary tumors, 5.9% (1/17) died from another reason, while 70.6% (12/17) remained alive,100% experienced pain relief, and mean NRS scores after implantation was 2.06 +/- 2.08 respectively.

3870,"The Artemis Program: An Overview of NASA's Activities to Return Humans to the Moon NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars. 2020 IEEE.",Excluded
4345,"Case report: Asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective high energy therapy in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy and left ventricular assist device BACKGROUND We present a case of asymptomatic ventricular fibrillation and ineffective defibrillation in a patient with left ventricular non compaction cardiomyopathy after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) Heart Mate III. Non compaction cardiomyopathy is a rare, congenital cardiomyopathy resulting from abnormal embryogenesis of myocardium with characteristic multiple trabeculations in ventricular apex. Its lethal character comes from frequent ventricular arrhythmias, often also with atrio ventricular conduction block. The main role of treatment is to improve cardiac efficiency, reduce the risk of arrhythmias, implant of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator for prevention of sudden cardiac death, ventricular assist device and heart transplant in cases of serious heart failure. CASE REPORT 61 year old patient with severe heart failure (LVEF 16%), diagnosed in 2012. In the course of non compaction cardiomyopathy after cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillation function in February 2018 and implantation left ventricular mechanical cardiac assistant LVAD with Heart Mate III system on 27.06.2019. The patient had 5 discharges of the device in a church without loss of consciousness and symptoms of apparent circulatory failure on 27.10.2019. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department in fair general condition, with basal crepitations over the lungs audible, slight dyspnea at rest, with ongoing Torsade de pointes in electrocardiographic examination, with ventricular rate 300/min, and blood pressure 100/60 Hg mm. Ventricular fibrillation was interrupted by external defibrillator, achieving sinus rhythm return. Basic examination results showed elevated proBNP values (4362 ng/l), features of pulmonary stasis on X ray. CRT D device memory showed 5 unsuccessful discharges of the device, followed by external effective defibrillation after exhausting all available high energy therapies, which restored sinus rhythm and synchronous biventricular stimulation. The patient was discharged home in good condition. CONCLUSIONS Ineffective high energy therapy in many cases ends in death. In this case, despite the abnormal electrical heart rate, LVAD was working correctly and ensured proper cardiovascular function.",Excluded
4373,"Percutaneous Vertebroplasty with Side-Opening Cannula or Front-Opening Cannula in the Treatment of Kummell Disease? OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bone cement distribution, cement leakage, and clinical outcomes with side-opening cannula for bone cement injection in percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) in treatment of Kummell disease., METHODS: A prospective study of patients with Kummell disease undergoing PVP was conducted from April 2012 to September 2017. In total, 43 patients (11 males, 32 females) with Kummell disease who received bilateral PVP were included in the study. The patients were divided into front-opening cannulas (FOC) group with front-opening cannulas and side-opening cannulas (SOC) group with side-opening cannulas. All patients were followed up for 6 months. The patient general information such as gender, age, bone density, compression ratio, operative time, and location of fracture vertebrae were recorded. Visual analogue scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), bone cement distribution, radiation exposure time, bone cement leakage rate and vertebral height, and kyphosis angle were measured and compared for two groups before surgery, 1 day and 6 months after surgery., RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were enrolled, including 11 males and 32 females, aged 61-84 years. The bone density (T value) was 2.5 +/- 0.6 in FOC group and 2.4 +/- 0.6 in SOC group (P > 0.05). The compression ratio and operative time were 36.1% +/- 13.0%, 39.3 +/- 7.9 min in FOC group and 35.2% +/- 13.7%, 40.0 +/- 10.7 min in SOC group (P > 0.05). There was no significance between FOC and SOC groups in the location of fracture vertebrae. All patients underwent at least 6 months of follow-up. At 6 months postoperatively, the VAS and ODI were significantly higher in the FOC group (3.0 +/- 0.8, 35.7% +/- 2.1%) than in the SOC group (1.3 +/- 0.4, 18.6% +/- 2.4%) (P < 0.05). The cement leakage rate of the SOC group was 4.8%, which was lower than that of the FOC group (31.8%, P < 0.05), and the bone cement distribution ratio was higher than that of the FOC group (63.1% +/- 7.9% vs 40.5% +/- 8.6%, P < 0.05). At 6 months after operation, the height of the anterior and posterior vertebral bodies of the patients in the SOC group restored better than the FOC group (anterior SOC: FOC 5.1 +/- 0.5 mm vs 4.5 +/- 0.5 mm; posterior SOC: FOC 0.6 +/- 0.1 mm vs 0.3 +/- 0.1 mm, P < 0.05), and the kyphosis correction was more obvious than patients in FOC group (SOC: FOC 8.5degree +/- 1.4degree vs 4.6degree +/- 0.8degree, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Percutaneous vertebroplasty with side-opening cannula is safe and effective in avoiding bone cement leakage, improving bone cement distribution, and restoring vertebral height.

3707,"Diagnostic accuracy of pulmonary CT angiography at low tube voltage: Intraindividual comparison of a normal-dose protocol at 120 kVp and a low-dose protocol at 80 kVp using reduced amount of contrast medium in a simulation study OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to simulate pulmonary emboli (PE) and image quality at low tube energy and reduced contrast material volume in normal-dose pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) images and to analyze the diagnostic accuracy with normal- and lowdose pulmonary CTA. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Normal-dose pulmonary CTA examinations using 120 kVp and 100 mL of contrast material in 10 patients with no PE were retrospectively selected. The image characteristics of an 80-kVp low-dose pulmonary CTA protocol (patient exposure reduction, 57%) with 75 mL of contrast material were simulated. Four different sets of filling defects were computer simulated in identical locations in each normal-dose and corresponding low-dose examination, equaling 783 PE in 40 normal-dose and 40 low-dose datasets. Ten normal- dose and 10 low-dose examinations contained no emboli and were used as controls. The 100 pulmonary CTA studies were randomly assessed by three readers blinded to PE location and image quality. The results were assessed by nonparametric tests and Student t tests. RESULTS. No difference was found between the CT protocols in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative diagnostic likelihood ratios at all ramification levels of the pulmonary arteries (p = 0.343-1). The overall sensitivity and specificity with the normal and simulated low-dose protocols were 79.9% versus 81.3% and 98.0% versus 98.2% (p = 0.444 and 0.702), respectively.

3921,"Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or robotic radiosurgery (RRS) for salvage treatment of colorectal liver metastases Background. Stereotactic radiation therapy is an evolving modality to treat otherwise unresectable liver metastases. In this analysis, two local therapies: 1) single session robotic radiosurgery (RRS) and 2) percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) were compared in a total of 60 heavily pretreated colorectal cancer patients. Methods. Thirty patients with a total of 35 colorectal liver metastases not qualifying for surgery that were treated in curative intent with RRS were prospectively followed. To compare efficacy of both treatment modalities, patients treated with RFA during the same period of time were matched according to number and size of the treated lesions. Local tumor control, local disease free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant recurrence (FFDR) were analyzed for efficacy. Treatment-related side effects were recorded for comparison. Results. The median diameter of the treated lesions was 33 mm (7-53 mm). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups. One- and two-year local control rates showed no significant difference but favored RRS (85% vs. 65% and 80% vs. 61%, respectively). A significantly longer local DFS of patients treated with RRS compared to RFA (34.4 months vs. 6.0 months; p < 0.001) was found. Both, median FFDR (11.4 months for RRS vs. 7.1 months for RFA p = 0.25) and the recurrence rate (67% for RRS and 63% for RFA, p > 0.99) were comparable. Conclusion. Single session RRS is a safe and effective method to treat colorectal liver metastases. In this analysis, a trend towards longer DFS was seen in patients treated with RRS when compared to RFA.Copyright © 2013 Informa Healthcare.",Excluded
3696,"Actinic cheilitis in dental practice Actinic cheilitis is a potentially premalignant condition involving predominantly the vermilion of the lower lip. The aim of the current paper was to review the clinical presentation of actinic cheilitis and demonstrate the development of management plans using a series of cases. These are designed to provide immediate treatment where required but also to address the medium and long-term requirements of the patient. The authors suggest that the clinical examination of lips and the assessment of actinic cheilitis and other lip pathology become a regular part of the routine soft tissue examination undertaken as a part of the periodic examination of dental patients. Early recognition of actinic cheilitis can allow the development of strategies for individual patients that prevent progression. These are based on past sun exposure, future lifestyle changes and the daily use of emollient sunscreens, broad-brimmed hats and avoidance of sun exposure during the middle of the day. This is a service that is not undertaken as a matter of routine in general medical practice as patients are not seen with the regularity of dental patients and generally not under the ideal examination conditions available in the dental surgery.",Excluded

Patient demographics, radiographic accuracy, and perioperative outcomes were recorded and compared. The accuracy of pedicle screw placement was according to the Gertzbein and Robbins scale and facet joint violation. Perioperative outcomes mainly included operative time, radiation exposure, and revisions., RESULTS: Of the 176 screws in the RA group, 164 screws were grade A, and 9, 2, and 1 screws were grades B, C, and D, respectively. Of the 204 screws in the FG group, 175 screws were grade A, with 16 screws scored as grade B, 8 screws scored as grade C, 3 screws scored as grade D, and 2 screws scored as grade E. The rate of perfect screw position (grade A) was higher in the RA group than in the FG group (93.2% vs. 85.8%, respectively; P = 0.020). In the FG group, 191 screws (93.6%) were clinically acceptable (groups A and B), whereas more acceptable screw positions were achieved in the RA group (98.3%; P = 0.024). Fewer screws in the RA group violated the proximal facet joint (5 vs. 24 screws, respectively; P = 0.001). The radiation dose was lower in the RA group (25.9 +/- 14.2 vs. 70.5 +/- 27.3 muSv, respectively; P < 0.001). Two screws in the FG group required a revision, but no revision was required in the RA group., CONCLUSIONS: RA pedicle screw placement is an accurate and safe procedure in TLIF for lumbar degenerative disease.

Purpose. To compare the data of MRA and diagnostic X-ray angiography of the renal arteries to determine a method that allows you to plan in detail the renal denervation procedure. Materials and methods. 44 patients (16 men, 28 women; average age was 59.18 years) with a verified diagnosis: resistant hypertension, admitted to treatment (renal denervation). All patients underwent standard preoperative laboratory and instrumental diagnostics. Survey aortography with selective renal angiography and MR angiography were performed in all 44 (100%) patients. Results and conclusion. It has been shown that both methods are comparable in the detection of renal arteries stenosis, as well as in visualization of the main renal artery and of segment branches of arteries, and in measurement of their diameters. In most cases MR-angiography a little bit exaggerates the diameter of the artery for as low as 0.6-0.8 mm. Also MR-angiography do not deliver radiation exposure to a patient. Moreover, MRA provides the opportunity of sequential thin-slice imaging, and may separate branches of the renal arteries up to segment branches of 3-4 classes with high accuracy. In total, the MRA predicts the anatomic imaging with invasive catheter X-ray angiography and allows to plan it in details before renal sympathetic denervation.Copyright © 2019 Russian Electronic Journal of Radiology.

3693,"Estimates of Environmental Exposure to Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields and Risk of Lymphoma Subtypes We investigated the association between environmental exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) and risk of lymphoma subtypes in a case-control study comprised of 322 patients and 444 individuals serving as controls in Sardinia, Italy in 1998-2004. Questionnaire information included the self-reported distance of the three longest held residential addresses from fixed radio-television transmitters and mobile phone base stations. We georeferenced the residential addresses of all study subjects and obtained the spatial coordinates of mobile phone base stations. For each address within a 500-meter radius from a mobile phone base station, we estimated the RF-EMF intensity using predictions from spatial models, and we performed RF-EMF measurements at the door in the subset of the longest held addresses within a 250-meter radius. We calculated risk of lymphoma and its major subtypes associated with the RF-EMF exposure metrics with unconditional logistic regression, adjusting by age, gender and years of education. In the analysis of self-reported data, risk associated with residence in proximity (within 50 meters) to fixed radio-television transmitters was likewise elevated for lymphoma overall [odds ratio = 2.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-4.6], and for the major lymphoma subtypes. With reference to mobile phone base stations, we did not observe an association with either the self-reported, or the geocoded distance from mobile phone base stations. RF-EMF measurements did not vary by case-control status. By comparing the self-reports to the geocoded data, we discovered that the cases tended to underestimate the distance from mobile phone base stations differentially from the controls (P = 0.073). The interpretation of our findings is compromised by the limited study size, particularly in the analysis of the individual lymphoma subtypes, and the unavailability of the spatial coordinates of radio-television transmitters. Nonetheless, our results do not support the hypothesis of a link between environmental exposure to RF-EMF from mobile phone base stations and risk of lymphoma subtypes.Copyright © 2018 by Radiation Research Society.",Excluded

Obstruction was measured as time taken to excretion of contrast medium in dynamic CT. Degree of secondary signs of obstruction was evaluated from the unenhanced CT. Data were collected on patients' gender and age, stone size and location, time from renal colic to follow-up, attenuation of the renal cortex and radiation dose., RESULTS: Obstruction was present in 28% (n = 14) at follow-up. Predictive values (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value) were calculated for hydronephrosis (1.0, 0.63, 0.52, 1.0), hydroureter (1.0, 0.4, 0.4, 1.0), perirenal stranding (0.21, 0.94, 0.6, 0.75), Gerota's fascia (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76) and renal swelling (0.21, 0.97, 0.75, 0.76).

4369,"Role of Angiogenesis in Chronic Radiation Proctitis: New Evidence Favoring Inhibition of Angiogenesis Ex Vivo Background: Chronic radiation proctitis (CRP), a common complication after radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies, compromises patient quality of life. Vascular damage and aberrant angiogenesis in the mucosal layer are essential histological features, but changes to the submucosal layer are unclear. Thus, we evaluated the histological characteristics and distribution changes of key angiogenic factors in full-layered human CRP samples. Method(s): Thirty paraffin-embedded CRP and twenty-nine non-CRP tissues were used to evaluate histopathological changes. Immunohistochemistry with anti-CD34 antibody was performed to calculate microvascular density (MVD). Frozen tissues from eight CRP patients and five non-CRP controls were collected and analyzed by antibody array, which contained sixty human angiogenesis-related factors. Quality controls with positive and negative controls were performed during antibody array analysis. Two differentially expressed factors were confirmed by ELISA. Result(s): CRP lesions showed vasculopathy, fibrosis, mucosal ulceration, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Human angiogenesis antibody array and ELISA confirmed the increased angiostatin in CRP lesions. Immunohistochemical staining showed dispersed distribution of angiostatin throughout the mucosal and submucosal layers in CRP lesions, while angiostatin accumulated within the vessel lumens in non-CRP tissues. MVD significantly decreased in the submucosal layer of CRP, suggesting a potential association with increased angiostatin. Conclusion(s): Angiostatin increased and had a distinct distribution in CRP lesions. Compensatory telangiectasia in the mucosa, vessel stenosis, and reduced MVD might attenuate blood flow in the submucosa and contribute to CRP progression. Restoration of vascular functionality by promoting angiogenesis in the submucosal layer may help alleviate CRP in clinical practice.Copyright © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Excluded

Result(s): Fifty patients (mean age 72.1 years; range 51-87 years) were treated; 45 were men (prostate cancer). The mean period between radiotherapy and initial APC treatment was 23 months (range 4-140 months). Seventeen (34%) patients had grade A endoscopic severity, 23 (46%) grade B, and 10 (20%) grade C. Other therapies failed in 16 (32%) patients. The mean number of treatments was 1.36 (range 1-3) with a mean follow-up of 20.6 months (range 6-48 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients were successfully treated after 1 session and 96% after 2 sessions. Bleeding scores improved in all patients (P < .001). Seventeen (34%) patients experienced short-term, self-limiting complications; 1 (2%) patient experienced a long-term complication. Limitation(s): Nonrandomized study. Conclusion(s): Large-volume APC treatment was successful in the treatment of CRP, including those in whom other therapies had previously failed, and resulted in a decreased number of treatments compared with other published studies. The benefits were offset by an increased incidence of short-term complications but no increase in long-term complications. © 2010 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",Excluded

3812,"The Free-Hand Technique for S2-Alar-Iliac Screw Placement: A Safe and Effective Method for Sacropelvic Fixation in Adult Spinal Deformity BACKGROUND: Spinopelvic fixation is an integral part of achieving solid fusion across the lumbosacral junction, especially in deformity procedures requiring substantial correction or long-segment constructs. Traditional S2-alar-iliac (S2AI) screw-placement techniques utilize fluoroscopy, increasing operative time and radiation exposure to the patient and surgeon. We describe a novel free-hand technique for S2AI screw placement in patients with adult spinal deformity., METHODS: We reviewed the records of 45 consecutive patients who underwent spinopelvic fixation performed with use of S2AI screws by the senior surgeon and various fellows or residents over a 12-month period (2015 to 2016). In each case, the S2AI screws were placed utilizing a free-hand technique without fluoroscopic or image guidance. Screw position and accuracy were assessed by intraoperative O-arm imaging and analyzed using 3-dimensional interactive manipulation of computed tomography images., RESULTS: A total of 100 screws were placed, 51 by the senior surgeon and 49 by trainees. The mean patient age was 57.4 +/- 12.7 years at the time of surgery; 37 (82.2%) of the patients were female. Preoperative diagnoses included adult idiopathic scoliosis (n = 19), adult degenerative scoliosis (n = 15), flatback syndrome (n = 2), fixed sagittal imbalance (n = 6), and distal junctional kyphosis (n = 3). Five (5%) of the screws were placed with moderate to severe cortical breaches, all of which perforated the pelvis posteriorly, with no clinically notable neurovascular or visceral complications. The breach rate did not differ significantly between the senior surgeon and trainees., CONCLUSIONS: The free-hand technique for S2AI screw placement, when performed in a standardized manner, was demonstrated to be safe and reliable in constructs requiring spinopelvic fixation. The accuracy of screw placement relies on visible and palpable anatomic landmarks that obviate the need for intraoperative fluoroscopy or image guidance, potentially reducing operative time and radiation exposure., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level IV.

4440,"Potential Functional Variants in DNA Repair Genes Are Associated with Efficacy and Toxicity of Radiotherapy in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Radiotherapy, either alone or with chemotherapy, is still the primary treatment for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are variations in how patients with NSCLC respond to radiotherapy and how toxic the therapy is. DNA repair gene polymorphisms are related to cancer development; however, their association with radiotherapy outcomes remains unknown. We hypothesized that gDNA repair gene variation could affect the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Methods. A total of 486 histologically confirmed patients with NSCLC were recruited from the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University from July 2015 to September 2019. Eleven potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in four DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XRCC2, XPD, and MSH2) were genotyped in these patients. A multiple factor logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between these SNPs and the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy. Results. Three SNPs, rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD), were all significantly associated with the efficacy of radiotherapy. The allele frequencies of the rs25487 CC genotype (OR = 0.457, 95% CI = 0.259-0.804, p=0.006) and the rs3218556 AG or AA genotypes (AG genotype: OR = 0.664, 95% CI = 0.442-0.999, p=0.049; AA genotype: OR = 0.380, 95% CI = 0.181-0.795, p=0.008) were both significantly higher in the response group than in the nonresponse group. For rs13181, the radiotherapy efficacy was associated with the heterozygous genotype GT (OR = 1.663, 95% CI = 1.057-2.614,p=0.027). Statistically significant associations between radiation-induced toxic reactions and rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) were also observed. The rs13181GT genotype was associated with lower toxic reactions than the TT genotype (OR = 1.680, 95% CI = 1.035-2.728,p=0.035). Conclusions. The variants rs25487 (XRCC1), rs3218556 (XRCC2), and rs13181 (XPD) all contribute to the efficacy and toxicity of radiotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Our findings may clarify the predictive value of DNA repair genes for prognosis in patients with NSCLC after radiotherapy. Further investigation of more genes and samples should be performed to confirm our findings.Copyright © 2020 Zhiguang Yang and Zhaoyu Liu.",Excluded
4514,"Prognostic factors in set of limited disease small-cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy Background: Combined chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with limited disease small cell lung cancer (LD SCLC). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is recommended in case of complete remission (CR) since late 90' and for partial remissions last few years. Early concurrent radiation (RT) has been found as slightly beneficial at cost of higher toxicity. Use of granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) for prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia is controversial in SCLC. We analyzed patients and treatment related variables for prognostic significance in long term follow-up of regional treatment protocol since 2000 in VFN, University Hospital Prague. Method(s): The planned treatment consisted of 4 to 6 courses of platinum/etoposide chemotherapy (CT) and thoracic irradiation of 45 to 66 grays with one daily fraction. Patients with CR or later with PR were assigned to PCI (30Gy in 15 fractions) at the end of treatment. Sequential strategy was preferred due to age over 70 or worse performance status. In some patients G-CSF prophylaxis was used. Influence of factors as sex, age, timing and dose of RT, dose and regimen of CT, G-CSF delivery, treatment response and PCI yes or not, were tested for survival impact. Result(s): Eighty consecutive patients were treated between Jan-2000 and Sep-2010, 49 men, 31 women, median age 62 years (range 49 - 80). CT in median dose of 5 cycles was predominantly cisplatin based, RT in median dose of 57.6 Gy was given concurrently in 56% and sequentially in 33% of patients. Thoracic RT was omitted in 9 patients, for poor performance status or progressive disease in 6 and due to radical surgery in 3 subjects. Esophagitis grade 3-4 occurred in 42%, significantly more often in concurrent RT (60% vs. 19%, p< 0.01). Response rate (RR) 90% and CR 62% in concurrent group did not differ significantly from sequential one (RR 88%, CR 52%). The median survival was 19.5 months and 3- and 5-year survival was 27% in all the patients. Survival differences in groups according to sex, age, stage, carbo or cisplatin and partial versus complete treatment response did not differ significantly. Significantly longer survival was observed in groups with PCI, with concurrent radiation or in patients treated with G-CSFs. Median time to progression was 14 months for the whole group. Significantly longer time to progression was in CR patients, concurrent RT, PCI patients and G-CSF delivery. Conclusion(s): Concurrent early chemoradiotherapy, PCI delivery and G-CSF treatment have shown significant impact on time to progression and overall survival in our group of LD SCLC patients.",Excluded
4056,"Stereotactic radiosurgery of small intracranial tumors: neuropathological correlation in three patients The mechanism by which radiosurgery can stop the growth of some tumors is poorly understood, in part because postmortem neuropathological findings in patients have been reported only rarely. To define further the effects of radiosurgery, we present the correlation among clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data in three patients with different intracranial tumors who died between 2 and 39 weeks after radiosurgery. The target volumes in two patients with malignant tumors showed sharply demarcated coagulative necrosis. In the third patient, who had a benign acoustic nerve tumor, neuropathological examination found intratumoral hemorrhage and cyst formation, but no necrosis. Radiosurgery appears to cause acute necrosis of malignant cells, although its effectiveness may be limited by the infiltrative nature of some tumors. In benign tumors, necrosis following radiosurgery is relatively delayed, and may not be required for growth arrest.",Excluded

Patients were classified into three groups according to BMI: normal (<24.99), overweight (25.0-29.99) and obese (>30). The results showed 52% and 135% higher DAP for overweight and obese patients compared to normal-weight patients (p < 0.001). A 46 and 123% rise of E for overweight and obese patients compared to normal-weight patients (p < 0.001) was discovered. Overweight patients received 37% higher dose and obese patients 107% higher dose to the organs compared to normal-weight patients. There were no statistically significant differences between IQ, except between normal weight and overweight patients.

4018,"Treatment for microcarcinoma of the thyroid - Clinical experience AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid is a specific subgroup of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and account for up to 30% of all PTC. According to the World Health Organization, papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid (PMC) is defined as a papillary thyroid carcinoma measuring <=10 mm in the greatest dimension. The relative rate of PMC is increasing in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) mainly due to more frequent use and improvement of ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and also more accurate histopathological examination of surgical specimens. The high incidence of PMC found in autopsy studies (up to 35%) suggests that most of them have a benign behavior. The locoregional recurrence has been reported in up to 20% of PMC patients and several cases of distant metastases have also been described. The 'ideal' therapeutic approach in PMC patients remains a subject of debate among endocrinologists and surgeons. Treatment of PMC in different departments varies from partial thyroidectomy to total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment. The main question in this group of patients is ""How should PMC patients be treated?"" The aim of this study was to investigate retrospectively the frequency and clinical behavior of PMC of the thyroid gland in our department and also to identify the optimal treatment of this group of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this retrospective study, we evaluated 120 patients with PMC in our department (between 1997 and 2005). The mean age of patients at diagnosis was 43 +/- 13 years (range 17-67 years). The female to male ratio was 87.5% (105 females, 15 males). The mean follow-up period of patients in this study was 45 months (16-84 months). Surgical treatment of patients with PMC in our department consisted of a bilateral total thyroidectomy in 25 patients (21%), and a bilateral near total thyroidectomy in 95 patients (79%). In the evaluation of our patients, multifocal PMC had a relative frequency of 15% (18/120 patients). The patients were informed about the different therapeutic strategies and the possible necessity for more frequent radioiodine treatment to eliminate thyroid remnants. All of the patients in our retrospective study had radioiodine (RAI) ablation therapy for residual thyroid tissue. RESULT(S): All patients received an RAI treatment dose which ranged from 75-150 mCi (2.7-5.5 GBq). Our criteria for ablation are as follows: negative I-131 WBS and very low serum Tg levels (<1 ng/mL). In 112/120 patients (93.3%), the thyroid remnant was ablated with a single dose of I-131 75-150 mCi (2.7-5.5 GBq). A second radioiodine treatment was necessary in 8 patients (7%), because of locoregional recurrence (required mean cumulative doses of 8.2-11 GBq I-131). Locoregional reccurence occurred in 2 patients with unifocal tumor, without capsular invasion or lymph node metastases and in 6 patients with multifocal tumor and/or in patients with capsular invasion or lymph node metastases. After a second radioiodine treatment, all of these 8 patients were ablated. All 120 patients remained free from disease (negative I-131 whole body scan, unmeasurable thyroglobulin levels) after a median follow-up period of 45 months and there was no recorded disease-related mortality. CONCLUSION(S): The treatment of patients with PMC should be no different from the treatment of patients with PTC, and thyroidectomy followed by radioiodine therapy may be a possible option for treatment of papillary microcarcinoma. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Excluded

3654,"Long-term outcome, relapse patterns, and toxicity after radiotherapy for orbital mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma: Implications for radiotherapy optimization Objectives: Although mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALToma) is sensitive to radiation therapy (RT), the optimal RT dose and treatment volumes have not been established. This study aimed to assess the relapse patterns and outcomes of patients with orbital MALToma who underwent RT and to suggest implications for optimized RT. Method(s): We reviewed 212 patients (246 orbits) diagnosed with orbital MALToma who received RT between 1993 and 2013. Median RT dose was 25.2 Gy. Generally, conjunctival and eyelid lesions were irradiated with electrons, whereas retrobulbar and lacrimal gland lesions with photons. Lens shielding was used for 70% of treated eyes, mainly conjunctival and eyelid tumors. Result(s): Relapse occurred in 29 patients. Among 11 patients with local relapse (LR), 4 were attributed to insufficient dose (n = 2) and improper RT volume (n = 2). The 10-year LR, contralateral orbit relapse, and distant relapse rates were 8.6%, 12.8% and 4.9%, respectively. Twelve patients died of disease-specific causes (n = 1) and intercurrent diseases (n = 11). The 10-year relapse-free survival, overall survival, and cause-specific survival rates were 69.7%, 88.2% and 98.8%, respectively. Grade 3 cataracts and nasolacrimal duct obstruction were observed in 27 and 4 orbits, respectively. Conclusion(s): Low-dose RT with proper lens shielding is an appropriate treatment for orbital MALToma in terms of high disease control rate and acceptable morbidity. However, lower RT dose may be attempted to further reduce toxicity while maintaining excellent outcomes.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.",Excluded
4561,"Positive association between heart dosimetry parameters and a novel cardiac biomarker, solubleST-2, in thoracic cancer chest radiation Background: Early screening and diagnosis of radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) is difficult in patients with chest radiation exposure. sST-2 is involved in myocardial stress or injury. We evaluated the relationship between heart dose parameters and sST-2 changes in chest malignant tumor patients who received chest radiation. Method(s): We prospectively collected thoracic malignancy cancer patients who had received chest radiotherapy. Heart dosimetry parameters were extracted from the treatment planning system. sST-2 was measured at baseline, the middle stage, and after radiotherapy (recorded as pre-ST-2, mid-ST-2, and post-ST-2). sST-2 change rate was calculated. Scatter plots showed the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Multiple regression was used to analyze the relationship between cardiac dose parameters and ST-2 change rate. Result(s): Totally, 60 patients were enrolled. The mean V5, V10, V20, V30, V40, and MHD was 60.93 +/- 27.79%, 51.43 +/- 25.44%, 39.17 +/- 21.75%, 28.07 +/- 17.15%,18.66 +/- 12.18%, and 18.60 +/- 8.63 Gy, respectively.

Materials/Methods: From January 2006 to December 2010, a total of 1,208 patients with NPC treated with IMRT according to our institutional protocol were collected in the current study. The CTV-N was contoured according to DAHANCA, EORTC, GORTEC, NCIC, and RTOG consensus guidelines but the level I, the retrostyloid space, and the medial retropharyngeal nodes below the cranial edge of the second cervical vertebra (C2) were spared. Patients with locoregionally advanced disease were also prescribed cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

Tumor cells were implanted stereotactically into the brains of syngeneic Fischer rats, and 13 or 17 d. later carboplatin (20 mug/10 mul) was administered by either CED over 30 min or by Alzet osmotic pumps (0.5 mug/mul/h for 168 h.) beginning at 7 d after tumor implantation. Rats were irradiated with a 15 Gy fractionated dose (5 Gy x 3) of 6 MV photons to the whole brain beginning on the day after drug administration. Other groups of rats received either carboplatin or X-irradiation alone. The tumor carboplatin concentration following CED of 20 mug in 10 mul was 10.4 mug/g, which was equal to that observed following i.v. administration of 100 mg/kg b.w. Rats bearing small tumors, treated with carboplatin and X-irradiation, had a mean survival time (MST) of 83.4 d following CED and 111.8 d following pump delivery with 40% of the latter surviving >180 d (i.e. cured) compared to 55.2 d for CED and 77.2 d. for pump delivery of carboplatin alone and 31.8 d and 24.2 d, respectively, for X-irradiated and untreated controls. There was no microscopic evidence of residual tumor in the brains of all long-term survivors. Not surprisingly, rats with large tumors had much shorter MSTs. Only modest increases in MSTs were observed in animals that received either oral administration or CED of temozolomide plus X-irradiation (23.2 d and 29.3 d) compared to X-irradiation alone. The present survival data, and those previously reported by us, are among the best ever obtained with the F98 glioma model. Initially, they could provide a platform for a Phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of CED of carboplatin in patients with recurrent glioblastomas, and ultimately a Phase II trial of carboplatin in combination with radiation therapy.",Excluded

The aim of the study was to compare the success rate, complication rate of different access sites for the treatment of superfitial artery stenosis in a randomized study Methods: 180 consecutive patients were randomized in a prospective study to treat symptomatic superficial femoral stenosis, via RA, FA and PA. Primary endpoint: technical success, rate of major and minor access site complications. Secondary endpoints: major adverse events (MAE), procedural factors, cross-over rate, and duration of hospitalization. Result(s): Technical success was achieved in 96.6%, 100% and 100% patients in RA, FA and PA group (p=ns). Secondary access site was used in 30%, 3.3% and 30% in the RA, FA and PA access group (p<0.01). Stent implantation was done in the femoral artery in 26.6%, 58.3% and 71.6% cases in RA, FA and PA group (p<0.01). CTO recanalization was performed in 34/36 (100%), 30/30 (100%) and 45/45 (100%) cases successfully in RA, FA and PA group (p=ns). Contrast consumption, fluoroscopy and procedure time was not statistically different, but the X Ray dose was significantly lower in PA than in the RA and FA access group (63.1 vs 162 vs 153 Dyn).

4236,"Geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus in the United States: contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation The objective was to investigate whether spatial variation in poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and solar radiation explains the strong pattern of geographical clustering of mortality from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the United States. SLE mortality counts for women and men of black and white race in US counties, 1979-1998, were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. County-level poverty rates and proportions of Hispanic residents were drawn from the 1990 national census. The annual cumulative level of ambient ultraviolet 'B' radiation (UVB) was estimated for each county according to latitude, longitude, and elevation. Maps for the full study population and for sex - and race-specific subpopulations showed that the national pattern of geographical variation in SLE mortality primarily reflected the experience of white women. Formal spatial analysis of the data for white women identified 10 statistically significant, multi-county clusters--four with elevated and six with reduced SLE mortality rates. Multivariate regression modeling established that higher levels of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity, and UVB were each associated with elevated local rates of SLE mortality among white women. Statistical adjustment via the regression model was used to remove effects of these factors on local rates. In a re-application of spatial analysis to the adjusted rates, four clusters 'disappeared'. In those clusters, poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and UVB had explained an average of 58.2% of the deviations between local and national SLE mortality rates. In six clusters (including three that disappeared with adjustment), Hispanic ethnicity explained a larger percentage of the deviations between local and national rates than either poverty or UVB. In multivariate models based on data for black women and for men of both races, poverty and UVB had similar effects on SLE mortality rates to those observed among white women. However, Hispanic ethnicity was not a significant predictor of SLE mortality in any of these other groups. The contributions of poverty, Hispanic ethnicity and solar radiation to geographical variation of SLE mortality in the United States are substantial, but these factors do not fully account for the clustering phenomenon.",Excluded
4301,"Safety and feasibility of robotic percutaneous coronary intervention: PRECISE (percutaneous robotically-enhanced coronary intervention) study Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety as well as the clinical and technical effectiveness of robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention. Background(s): Robotic systems have been suggested to enhance the performance of cardiovascular procedures, as well as to provide protection from the occupational hazards that are associated with interventional practice. Method(s): Patients with coronary artery disease and clinical indications for percutaneous intervention were enrolled. The coronary intervention was performed with the CorPath 200 robotic system, which consists of a remote interventional cockpit and a bedside disposable cassette that enables the operator to advance, retract, and rotate guidewires and catheters. The primary endpoints were clinical procedural success, defined as <30% residual stenosis at the completion of the robotic-assisted procedure without major adverse cardiovascular events within 30 days, and device technical success, defined as the successful manipulation of the intracoronary devices using the robotic system only. Result(s): A total of 164 patients were enrolled at 9 sites. Percutaneous coronary intervention was completed successfully without conversion to manual operation, and device technical success was achieved in 162 of 164 patients (98.8%). There were no device-related complications. Clinical procedural success was achieved in 160 of 164 patients (97.6%), whereas 4 (2.4%) had periprocedural non-Q-wave myocardial infarctions. No deaths, strokes, Q-wave myocardial infarctions, or revascularization occurred in the 30 days after the procedures. Radiation exposure for the primary operator was 95.2% lower than the levels found at the traditional table position. Conclusion(s): This pivotal multicenter study with a robotic-enhanced coronary intervention system demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the system. The robotic remote-control procedure met the expected technical and clinical performance, with significantly lower radiation exposure to the operator.

4577,"[The aqueous humour antioxidative capacity in different types and color of the age-related cataract] BACKGROUND/AIM: Oxidative stress results from increased oxidative processes, decreased antioxidative protection, or both processes simultaneously. Photooxidative stress, as a form of oxidative stress, induced by the energy of solar radiation, today is considered as crucial in the age-related cataractogenesis. Other known and unknown, endogenous and egsogenous factors that contribute to the oxidative stress intensity, can influnce the cataract type and brunescence. Thus the oxidative stress intensity and its form might determine the cataract type and brunescence, and also make the efforts in cataract prevention more complex. Hence, the objective of the present paper was to investigate the current amount of antioxidative capacity in aqueous humour during the cataract genesis of different types and pigmentation of cataract., METHODS: Transversal review of 80 samples of humour aqueous obtained during extracapsular cataract extraction. Aqueouses were analyzed by tiobarbituric acid (TBA) method for the total antioxidant activity estimation, expressed as %iMDA, and by using 0.1 ml of aqueous., RESULTS: The mixed type of cataract showed the statistically significantly lower values of the intensities of antioxidative protection in aqueous humour compared to cortical and nuclear cataracts (p < 0.001, respectively). Between pure nuclear and cortical cataracts we found the small differences of the investigated parameter, but they pointed to the decreased level of antioxidative protection, i.e. the increased intensity of the aqueous humour oxidative stress in the cortical cataract type. A significant correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturation and the %iMDA (p < 0.05) was found., CONCLUSIONS: The role of the oxidative stress, here expressed as the antioxidative capacity of aqueous humour, could not be the same for all the cataract types. The lower level of antioxidative protection of aqueous in brunescent and mixed cataracts may point to the higher intensity of oxidative stress in those cataract types. The correlation betweer the cortical cataract maturity and %iMDA points to the significant decrease of the aqueous antioxidative protection in the cataract progression.",Excluded
3669,"Image quality and radiation exposure of coronary CT angiography in patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery: Influence of imaging direction with 64-slice dual-source CT Background: The evaluation of native coronary arteries (NCAs) as well as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patency after surgery is essential. However, NCAs are often blurred in the craniocaudal scan direction because of long scan time with 64-slice CT. Objective(s): The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of scan direction on image quality and radiation exposure in assessment of NCAs and CABGs. Method(s): Retrospective analysis of 191 consecutive individuals undergoing coronary CT angiography to evaluate CABG patency using 64-slice dual source CT. A retrospectively ECG gated spiral acquisition protocol with ECG based tube current modulation and automatic adjustment of tube current to a reference of 320 mAs (""CareDose 4D"") was used. Tube current was 120 kVp. Scan direction was either cranio-caudal (CRC, n = 98) or caudo-cranial (CRC, n = 93) and the scan volume covered the entire course of all bypass grafts. Independent investigators determined quantitative image quality of the coronary arteries by evaluating contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation exposure by comparing the effective dose, and qualitative image quality through a 5 point rating scale. Result(s): Quantitative image quality was not significantly different for the two groups except for the CNR of the right coronary artery which was significantly higher in patients with caudio-cranial scan direction (P= .0007). The qualitative image quality of the CaC group also was better for both NCAs and CABGs (P= .002 for NCAs and <.001 for CABGs), mostly because of the lower frequency of respiration artifacts on coronary arteries of the CaC group (P= .005). As an effect of automatic tube current adjustment, radiation dose was lower in patients with caudo-cranial scan direction (6.8 mSv vs. 9.6 mSv, p < 0.0001). Conclusion(s): In patients with coronary bypass grafts imaged by 64-slice dual source CT with spiral acquisition and automated tube current adjustment, a caudo-cranial scan direction results in improved image quality and reduced radiation exposure. © 2014 Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography.",Excluded
4530,"Assessment of the degradation rates and effectiveness of different coated Mg-Zn-Ca alloy scaffolds for in vivo repair of critical-size bone defects Surgical repair of bone defects remains challenging, and the search for alternative procedures is ongoing. Devices made of Mg for bone repair have received much attention owing to their good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. We developed a new type of scaffold made of a Mg-Zn-Ca alloy with a shape that mimics cortical bone and can be filled with morselized bone. We evaluated its durability and efficacy in a rabbit ulna-defect model. Three types of scaffold-surface coating were evaluated: group A, no coating; group B, a 10-mum microarc oxidation coating; group C, a hydrothermal duplex composite coating; and group D, an empty-defect control. X-ray and micro-computed tomography(micro-CT) images were acquired over 12 weeks to assess ulnar repair. A mechanical stress test indicated that bone repair within each group improved significantly over time (P < 0.01). The degradation behavior of the different scaffolds was assessed by micro-CT and quantified according to the amount of hydrogen gas generated; these measurements indicated that the group C scaffold better resisted corrosion than did the other scaffold types (P < 0.05). Calcein fluorescence and histology revealed that greater mineral densities and better bone responses were achieved for groups B and C than for group A, with group C providing the best response. In conclusion, our Mg-Zn-Ca-alloy scaffold effectively aided bone repair. The group C scaffold exhibited the best corrosion resistance and osteogenesis properties, making it a candidate scaffold for repair of bone defects.",Excluded

4492,"Utilization of chest CT for injured patients during visits to U.S. emergency departments: 2012-2015 Introduction: Increased use of computed tomography (CT) during injury-related Emergency Department (ED) visits has been reported, despite increased awareness of CT radiation exposure risks. We investigated national trends in the use of chest CT during injury-related ED visits between 2012 and 2015. Method(s): Analyzing injury-related ED visits from the 2012-2015 United States (U.S.) National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), we determined the percentage of visits that had a chest CT and the diagnostic yield of these chest CTs for clinically-significant findings. We used survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression to determine which patient and visit characteristics were associated with chest CT use. Result(s): Injury-related visits accounted for 30% of the 135 million yearly ED visits represented in NHAMCS. Of these visits, 817,480 (2%) received a chest CT over the study period. The diagnostic yield was 3.88%. Chest CT utilization did not change significantly from a rate of 1.73% in 2012 to a rate of 2.31% in 2015 (p = 0.14). Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated increased odds of chest CT for patients seen by residents versus by attendings (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41-3.08). Patients aged 18-59 and 60+ had higher AORs (5.75, CI 3.44-9.61 and 9.81, CI 5.90-16.33, respectively) than those <18 years of receiving chest CT.

3745,"Experience with higher doses of radiotherapy in the postoperative treatment of glioblastoma multiforme: A single institutional report Background: Glioblastoma multiforme is a highly aggressive tumour with median survival of approximately 14 months. Management consists of maximal surgical resection followed by postoperative chemoradiation with concurrent then adjuvant temozolamide. The standard radiotherapy dose is 60 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. Most tumour recurrences occur within the previous irradiation field. Regimens designed to deliver higher radiation dose to improve local control and enhance survival warrant investigation. Method(s): We report a single institutional experience of treatment of consecutive patients with glioblastoma multiforme, treated with resection, postoperative radiotherapy followed by concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. Finding(s): Of the 80 patients who entered the study, 68 completed the treatment course; there were 45 (66.2 %) male and 23 (33.8%) female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 48.97 +/- 12.85 (21-75) years. At a median follow up of 19 months, 39 (57.3%) patients had evidence of tumour progression and 36 (52.9%) patients had died. Median overall survival for all patients was 16 months and progression-free survival for all patients was 6.02 months. All potential prognostic factors were analysed to evaluate their effects on overall survival. age of 50 years or younger, concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, and extent of surgery were significant. We noted a lower progression rate among patients who received higher doses of radiotherapy (>60 Gy; p = 0.03). Overall survival was also increased, but this was not significant. Interpretation(s): This study suggests that higher radiation doses (>60 Gy) can improve local control and potentially survival; prospective multicentric studies should be done to evaluate the effect of higher doses of conformal radiation on the outcomes of patients with glioblastoma multiforme.",Excluded
3872,"Triiodothyronine increases calcium loss in a bed rest antigravity model for space flight Bed rest has been used as a model to simulate the effects of space flight on bone metabolism. Thyroid hormones accelerate bone metabolism. Thus, supraphysiologic doses of this hormone might be used as a model to accelerate bone metabolism during bed rest and potentially simulate space flight. The objective of the study was to quantitate the changes in bone turnover after low doses of triiodothyronine (T(3)) added to short-term bed rest. Nine men and 5 women were restricted to bed rest for 28 days with their heads positioned 6 degrees below their feet. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or oral T(3) at doses of 50 to 75 microg/d in a single-blind fashion. Calcium balance was measured over 5-day periods; and T(3), thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, immunoreactive parathyroid hormone, osteocalcin, bone alkaline phosphatase, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were measured weekly. Triiodothyronine increased 2-fold in the men and 5-fold in the women during treatment, suppressing both thyroxine and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Calcium balance was negative by 300 to 400 mg/d in the T(3)-treated volunteers, primarily because of the increased fecal loss that was not present in the placebo group. Urinary deoxypyridinoline to creatinine ratio, a marker of bone resorption, increased 60% in the placebo group during bed rest, but more than doubled in the T(3)-treated subjects (P < .01), suggesting that bone resorption was enhanced by treatment with T(3). Changes in serum osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, markers of bone formation, were similar in T(3)- and placebo-treated subjects.

To evaluate the outcomes after treating patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) without elective nodal irradiation and to evaluate the effects of hypofractionated IFRT. Methods. From December 2004 to November 2015, 51 patients with advanced NSCLC underwent IFRT. Of these, 45 patients were enrolled and evaluated. The median age was 69 years (range, 50-89 years), and 42 patients were men and women. Eleven patients (24.4%) presented with adeno-carcinoma, 30 (66.7%) with squamous cell carcinoma, and (8.9%) with other types. Twenty-four (53.3%) had stage IIIA and 21 (46.7%) had stage IIIB. In patients treated by conventional IFRT, normal fractionation was used (2 Gy/fraction), and the total prescribed dose ranged from 60 to 66 Gy. In patients treated by hypofractionated IFRT, 2.5 Gy/fraction was used, and the total prescribed dose ranged from 65 to 70 Gy. Results. The 1- and 2-year overall survival rates were 78.4% and 53.7% , respectively. The 1- and 2-year local control rates were 72.2% and 57.7% , respectively. The patients in the conventional IFRT group had a 1-year local control rate of 61.2% and a 2-year local control rate of 47.6%, while the patients in the hypofractionated IFRT group achieved higher local control rates of 87.1% and 72.5%, respectively (P = 0.0465) Conclusions. IFRT for patients with stage III NSCLC is feasible, and the incidence of elective nodal failure was low. Hypofractionated IFRT may therefore contribute to improvements in local control and overall survival.",Excluded
3480,"Radiographic joint damage and mortality in rheumatoid arthritis patients: 20 years survival study Background Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with increased mortality and reduced life expectancy compared with the general population. This mortality gap has increased in the last years since mortality rates for RA have remained constant throughout time while mortality rates for the general population have decline. Excess mortality has been associated with disease activity. Radiographic joint destruction reflects the cumulative burden of inflammation and it is conceived as an objective measure of RA severity. Objectives The objective of our study is to analyze the influence of radiological joint damage in the mortality rate in a cohort of RA patients. Methods We included 783 RA patients in a retrospective longitudinal study, from May 1993 to November 2013, attending the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Hospital Clinico San Carlos (Madrid, Spain). Subjects were included at the moment of their first X-ray, until October 2012, and followed until patients' death, loss of follow up or November 2013. Clinical records were examined and demographic and clinical data was collected. Radiographic joint damage of hands and wrists was assessed with the Sharp vand-der-Heijde score [total (SHS), erosion (ES) and narrowing/(sub)luxation (NSLS) components]. Survival techniques were applied to estimate the mortality rate (MR; expressed per 1000 patients-years with a 95% of Confidence Interval [95% CI]). Cox bivariate and multivariate regression models were conducted to examine risk factors for death. Interaction terms between radiological damage and rheumatoid factor (RF) positivity, and the elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, were introduce in the models. Proportional hazard assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals and the scaled Schoenfeld residuals. Results were expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI. Results Most of the patients included were women (74%), with a median age of 61 years old (interquartile range [IQR]: 47-71), 67% were RF positive, and the median (IQR) elapsed time between RA symptoms onset and the X-ray was 2 (0-7) years. The median (range) followed up time per patient was 5 [0.4-20] years. 92 patients died during a follow up time of 4758 person-years. Mortality rate was 19 per 1000 patient-year [95% CI 16-24]. We observed in the bivariate analysis that older age, male sex, higher elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray, SHS, ES, NSLS, number of hospital admissions (used as a surrogate measure of comorbidity), basal Health Assessment Questionnaire, RF positivity, earlier RA onset (in calendar time), and no treatment with biological therapy, were associated with a higher MR. 3 multivariate models were constructed, using SHS, ES or NSLS as measures for joint destruction, and adjusted by the previous variables. In none of the models radiographic damage was associated with MR. However, we observed that the interaction between ES and RF positivity and with elapsed time from RA onset to X-ray were both significant (p=0.001, p=0.03, respectively): the lower elapsed time, the greater the effect of ES in the MR. On the other hand, ES was associated to MR only in RF negative patients. Conclusions Erosive joint damage seems to be a risk factor for all cause mortality among RF negative RA patients. Early radiographic damage seems to better predict mortality.",Excluded
3748,"Influence of Ranibizumab versus laser photocoagulation on radiation retinopathy (RadiRet) - a prospective randomized controlled trial PURPOSE: To demonstrate superiority of intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg compared to focal and peripheral laser treatment in patients with radiation retinopathy for choroidal melanoma., METHODS: Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with radiation retinopathy and visual acuity impairment due to radiation maculopathy accessible for laser therapy, age >= 18 years, and BCVA less than 20/32. The main objective was to study the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) over 6 months from ranibizumab 0.5 mg (experimental) compared to focal laser of the macula and panretinal laser treatment of the ischemic retina (control) in patients with radiation retinopathy in choroidal melanoma. The secondary objectives of the radiation retinopathy study were to compare functional and anatomical results between ranibizumab and laser group over 12 months and to measure the frequency of vitreous hemorrhage and rubeosis iridis., RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis included 31 patients assigned to ranibizumab (n = 15) or laser treatment (n = 16). In terms of BCVA at month 6, ranibizumab was superior to laser treatment, with an advantage of 0.14 logMAR, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.25, p = 0.030. The positive effect of ranibizumab disappeared after treatment was discontinued. Similar results without statistically significant difference were found with respect to macular thickness. In both groups, no change was observed at month 6 in the size of ischemia in the macula or periphery compared to baseline. There was 1 case of vitreous hemorrhage in the laser group and no case of rubeosis iridis over time., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a statistically significant improvement in visual acuity and clear superiority of ranibizumab compared to laser treatment up to 26 weeks, but this effect disappeared at week 52 after completion of intravitreal treatment.

In all, 86% of patients received 2 cycles of chemotherapy previously., RESULTS: Five treatment-related deaths occurred: pneumonitis, n = 1; progressive pulmonary fibrosis in patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis, n = 2; haemorrhage, n = 2. In all, 8% of patients experienced grade 3 and 1.3% grade 4 pneumonitis; 11% showed late fibrotic alterations grade 2 in lung parenchyma. Clinically relevant acute esophagitis (grade 2 and 3) was seen in 33.3% of patients, 2 patients developed late esophageal stenosis (G3). Patients with upper lobe, middle lobe and central lower lobe tumours (n = 130) were treated with V20 (total lung) up to 50% and patients with peripheral lower lobe tumours (n = 14, basal lateral tumours excluded) up to 42%, without observing acute or late pulmonary toxicity >grade 3. Only patients with basal lateral lower lobe tumours (n = 5) experienced grade 4/5 pulmonary toxicity; V20 for this latter group ranged between 30 and 53%. The mean lung dose was below the QUANTEC recommendation of 20-23 Gy in all patients. The median follow-up time of all patients is 26.3 months (range 2.9-149.4) and of patients alive 80.2 months (range 63.9-149.4.). The median overall survival time of all patients is 26.3 months; the 2-, 5- and 8-year survival rates of 54, 21 and 15%, respectively. The local tumour control rate at 2 and 5 years is 70 and 64%, the regional control rate 90 and 88%, respectively., DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Grade 4 or 5 toxicity occurred in 7/150 patients (4.7%), which can be partially avoided in the future (e.g. by excluding patients with pre-existing pulmonary fibrosis).

4036,"Improved local control for early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma--a tale of two hospitals PURPOSE: To study the efficacy of intracavitary brachytherapy (ICT) in early T-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., METHODS AND MATERIALS: All early T-stage (T1 and T2 nasal cavity tumour) NPC treated with a curative intent up to 1996 were analyzed (n=743), 163 from the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) and 25 from Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) were given ICT after radical external radiotherapy (ERT; group A). They were compared with 555 patients treated with ERT alone (group B). The radiotherapy techniques were identical between the two hospitals. The ERT delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected biological equivalent dose (BED)-10, > or = 75 Gy) to the primary tumour, and this did not differ in technique or dosage between the two groups. The ICT delivered a dose of 18-24 Gy in three fractions over 15 days to a point 1 cm perpendicular to the midpoint of the plane of the sources., RESULTS: The local failure was significantly less (crude rates, 6.9 vs. 13.0%; 5-year actuarial rates, 5.8 vs. 11.7%) and the disease-specific mortality was significantly lower (crude rates, 13.8 vs. 18.9%; 5-year actuarial rates, 12.2 vs. 15.2%) in group A compared with group B. ICT was the only significant independent prognostic factor predictive of fewer local failures. When ICT was excluded from the Cox regression model, the total physical dose or the total BED-10 uncorrected for tumour repopulation became significant in predicting the ultimate local failure rate. The two groups were comparable in the rate of the chronic radiation complications. A significant dose-tumour-control relationship existed, plotting the local failure as a function of the total physical dose or the total BED., CONCLUSIONS: Supplementing ERT, which delivered the tumoricidal dose (uncorrected BED-10, > or = 75 Gy), with ICT significantly enhanced ultimate local control in early T-stage (T1/T2 nasal infiltration) NPC.

4215,"A single-institution phase I feasibility study of dose-escalated IMRT for non-operative locally advanced esophageal carcinoma Background and purpose: Radiation dose escalation to improve poor outcomes with chemoradiation in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is limited in part by increased toxicity. This Phase I study investigates the use of IMRT to improve tolerability of dose escalation. Material(s) and Method(s): A single-institution, prospective study was conducted between 2007 and 2013 for individuals with inoperable esophageal carcinoma. Gross disease received 60 Gy in 30 fractions and at-risk sites received 54 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost. Concurrent chemotherapy primarily consisted of cisplatin/5-FU. The primary objective was to assess feasibility (<15% rate of grade 4-5 toxicity). Secondary objectives included assessment of overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS), and locoregional (LRR) and distant recurrence. Result(s): Twenty-six patients were enrolled with median follow up of 17.6 months (range 0.1 to 152.0). The majority were AJCC 7th edition Stage III (54%), distal esophagus primary (81%), and adenocarcinoma histology (85%). Twenty-one patients (81%) completed their course of radiation therapy, while only 55% received 2 cycles of concurrent cisplatin/5-FU. One grade 5 and one grade 4 cardiac event occurred, both during chemoradiation and before receiving 50 Gy. The 3-year OS was 48.6% (95% CI: 32.5 to 72.2%) and PFS was 28.5% (95% CI: 14.6 to 55.5%). Half developed distant failure with LRR occurring in 10 patients (38%), isolated in 5 patients. Conclusion(s): While feasibility was demonstrated, toxicity and compliance remained limiting factors with outcomes similar to historical controls.

This study was aimed to investigate and quantify this learning effect, with fluoroscopy time and dose-area product (DAP) as parameters. We collected procedure data of the first to the fortieth cerebral DSA consecutively performed by 13 trainees in a training centre. DAP, procedure time, fluoroscopy time, number of cine-frames of the first 20 DSA procedures performed by these trainees were compared with that of the second 20 procedures. There was no significant difference concerning the procedure time between the first and the second 20 procedures (56.3 +/- 29.5 vs 51.5 +/- 20.2 min, p = 0.113). Numbers of cine-frames were very similar between the first and the second 20 procedures (750.7 +/- 290.3 vs 744.5 +/- 188.7, p = 0.830). Fluoroscopy time of the first 20 procedures was significantly longer than that of the second 20 procedures (17.8 +/- 15.4 vs 12.6 +/- 9.0, p = 0.001). DAP of the first 20 procedures was significantly higher than that of the second 20 procedures (6.4 +/- 4.9 vs 3.8 +/- 1.8, p < 0.001). DAP was correlated significantly with the performer's experience (R = -0.288, p < 0.001). There exists a learning effect of radiation exposure during cerebral DSA procedures performed by trainees. The learning effect is significant during the first 20 procedures, and becomes insignificant after 20 procedures. Insufficient catheter skills in novice trainees may be one reason for this effect.",Excluded
3373,"NOS1-, NOS3-, PIK3CA-, and MAPK pathways in skin following radiation therapy Background: Essential molecular pathways such as the MAPK pathway, NO system, or the influence of PIK3CA as an oncogene are known to regulate fundamental signalling networks. However, few knowledge about their role in the occurrence of wound healing disorders (WHD) following radiation therapy (RT) exists. This study aims to evaluate the expression profiles of specific molecular pathway marker genes. Method(s): Expression profiles of the genes encoding MAPK, NOS1, NOS3, and PIK3CA were analyzed, by RT-PCR, in specimens from patients with and without a history of RT to the head and neck. Clinical data on the occurrence of cervical WHDs were analyzed. Result(s): Expression analysis of patients with postoperative WHDs revealed a significant increase in MAPK expression compared to the control group without occurrence of postoperative WHDs. PIK3CA showed a significantly increased expression in patients with a history of RT. Expression analysis of all other investigated genes did not reveal significant differences. Conclusion(s): This current study is able to show the influence of RT on different molecular pathways. This underlines the crucial role of specific molecular networks, responsible for the occurrence of long-term radiation toxicity such as WHDs. Additional studies should be carried out to identify possible starting points for therapeutic interventions.Copyright © The Author(s). 2017.",Included
3810,"Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (Squamous Cell Carcinoma) of the socket: Management of extensive tumors with interferon PURPOSE:: To describe the clinical features and management of extensive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (squamous cell carcinoma) of the socket. METHOD(S):: Retrospective interventional case series. Interferon alpha 2b (IFNa2b) eye drops (1 million units/cc) 4 times daily and IFNa2b sublesional injection (5 million units/0.5cc to 8 million units/0.8 cc) were delivered for tumor control. Participants were 3 patients with ocular prosthesis who developed extensive socket OSSN. Tumor control was graded as complete regression, partial regression, or no regression. RESULT(S):: OSSN was detected in the socket at age 60, 43, and 20 years in patients who had worn ophthalmic prostheses for 54, 26, and 13 years, respectively. The patients had chronic discharge and irritation (n = 3) managed with intermittent topical corticosteroids (n = 2). There were no predisposing factors of cigarette exposure, radiation exposure, eczema, systemic immune suppression, or organ transplantation. The prosthesis fit well with nonirritative edges. At presentation, OSSN was subtle (n = 3), vascular (n = 3), and multifocal (n = 3), with largest lesions or confluence of lesions measuring 20, 25, and 20 mm, respectively. The tumors involved the tarsal (n = 3), bulbar (n = 2), and forniceal (n = 2) surfaces. All patients were treated with topical and injection IFNa2b, with complete regression achieved in 2 cases (at 1 months and 20 months) and partial regression in one case (at 9 months). All patients continue on chronic maintenance IFNa2b topically. There were no recurrences, and IFNa2b injection side effects of nausea and chills were minor, lasting 1 day. No patient required surgical removal of tumors from the socket and no patient required exenteration. CONCLUSION(S):: Patients wearing ophthalmic prosthesis over a socket should be monitored for the development of OSSN. Combined topical and injection IFNa2b could represent a potentially effective therapy for this condition. © 2011 The American Society of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Inc.",Excluded

Depending on the localization of the tumor, dissection of one or more of the rectus muscles is necessary during placement of the plaque or during the course of protracted irradiation. Orthoptic investigations were performed to evaluate the cause of motility disorders and to follow up the functional outcome. In 13 patients (out of 30) who underwent ruthenium-106 therapy for uveal melanomas, one or more muscles had to be dissected during placement of the plaque and were reinserted in the same operation or after removal of the applicator. In 4 cases rectus muscles had to be shifted and were replaced after the irradiation. There were 5 patients who developed motility disorders with double vision. All of them were orthophoric within 6 months without surgery.",Excluded
3567,"Interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus does delayed surgery have an impact on outcome? Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) affects postoperative outcomes in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thoracic esophagus. Background(s): Esophagectomy is usually recommended within 4 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant CRT. However, the optimal timing of surgery is not clearly defined. Method(s): A total of 129 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, treated between 1998 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of timing to surgery: group 1, <=30 days (n = 17); group 2, 31 to 60 days (n = 83); and group 3, 61 to 90 days (n = 29). Subsequently, only 2-numerically more consistent-groups were studied, using the median value of timing intervals as a cutoff level: group A, <=46 days (n = 66); and group B, <46 days (n = 63). Result(s): Groups were comparable in terms of patient and tumor characteristics, type of neoadjuvant regimen, toxicity, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, tumor downstaging, and pathologic complete responses. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0% in group 1, 43.1% in group 2, and 35.9% in group 3 (P = 0.13). After R0 resection (n = 106), the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0%, 51%, and 47.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). Tumor recurrence after R0 resection seemed to be inversely related, even if not significantly (P = 0.17), to the time interval between chemoradiation and surgery: 50% in group 1, 40.6% in group 2, and 21.7% in group 3. When considering only 2 groups, the overall 5-year survival was 33.1% in group A and 42.7% in group B (P = 0.64); after R0 resection, the 5-year survival was 37.8% and 56.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). The rate of tumor recurrence was significantly lower in group B (25%) than in group A (48.3%) (P = 0.02). Conclusion(s): Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not compromise the outcomes of patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. Delaying surgery up to 90 days offers relevant advantages in the clinical management of the patients, can reduce tumor recurrences, and may improve prognosis after complete R0 resection surgery.

4008,"Acute phase response before treatment predicts radiation esophagitis in non-small cell lung cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation esophagitis (RE) represents an inflammatory reaction to radiation therapy (RT). We hypothesized that aspects of the physiologic acute phase response (APR) predicts RE., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 285 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation. The primary analysis was the association of pretreatment lab values reflective of the APR with symptomatic (grade 2) RE. Univariate and multivariate odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to test associations of clinical and pretreatment lab values with RE. Optimal cutpoints and multivariable risk stratification groupings were determined via recursive partitioning analysis., RESULTS: Pretreatment platelet counts were higher and hemoglobin levels lower in patients who developed RE (P<0.05). Based on these two pre-treatment risk factors, an APR score was defined as 0 (no risk factors), 1 (either risk factor), or 2 (both risk factors). APR score was significantly associated with RE in both univariate (OR = 2.3 for each point, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-3.4, P = 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4, P = 0.002) analyses., CONCLUSIONS: The APR score may represent a novel metric to predict RE. However, pending validation in an independent dataset, caution is advised when interpreting these results given their retrospective and thus exploratory nature. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

4002,"Critical analysis of lumbar interspinous devices failures: A retrospective study Interspinous devices (IDs) were introduced in the 90s. Since then, they have rapidly become very popular for the minimally invasive treatment of lumbar pain disorders. They feature different shapes and biomechanical characteristics, and are used in the spine degenerative pathologies or as motion segment stabilizers (dynamic stabilization) or to obtain the decompression of neurological structures. The indications seem to be rather narrow and still to be verified in terms of their clinical efficacy. However, IDs are being extensively utilized beyond their classical indications with the inevitable risk of a clinical failure. The aim of the present work was to carry out a critical analysis of the causes of failure in a series of 19 patients. From January 2007 to March 2009, 19 patients with residual painful syndrome after the implantation of IDs were observed. The series includes 11 males and 8 females with a mean age of 53.6 years (range 38-84 years) who were operated on elsewhere and who underwent revision surgery at our hospital. The inclusion criteria were low back pain and/or radiculopathy after the device implantation without improvement of the painful symptomatology, radiculopathy with signs of sensory and motor deficit, intermittent neurogenic claudication, and infection. All patients were thoroughly re-assessed with new standard imaging examinations such as MRI and CT scans, considering the following image features: the position of the device with respect to the spinous processes (X-ray), the intervertebral disc disease of the level operated upon or of the adjacent levels (MRI), the segmental instability (dynamic X-rays), the severity of the canal stenosis (CT). The accurate evaluation of the clinical and imaging parameters revealed three main causes of failure: errors of indication, technical errors and the structural failure of the ID. The most frequent cause of failure was a wrong indication. The results of the study are presented and the causes of failure are discussed in detail. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded
4520,"Intensity-Modulated Proton and Carbon-Ion Radiation Therapy in the Management of Head and Neck Sarcomas Purpose: We report our experience of intensity-modulated proton and carbon-ion radiotherapy (IMPT/IMCT) for head and neck sarcomas (HNS). Methods and Materials: An analysis of the ongoing prospective data registry from the Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Center (SPHIC) for patients with HNS was conducted. The 12- and 24-month rates of local recurrence-free, overall, distant metastasis-free, progression-free survival (LRFS, OS, DMFS, and PFS), and acute/late toxicities were calculated. The prognostic factors for the effectiveness of the treatment were also analyzed. Result(s): Between 7/2014 and 5/2018, 51 consecutive patients with HNS received definitive doses of IMCT (41 cases), IMPT (two cases), or their combination (eight cases). One patient had R0 resection and another treated on the Chinese Food and Drug Administration registration trial received IMPT only. Twenty-seven patients were treated according to various dose escalation trials or institutional protocols using IMCT or IMPT + IMCT boost. Twenty-two patients with locoregional recurrence (10 and four patients failed surgery or surgery followed by radiotherapy, respectively) or radiation-induced second primary sarcomas (eight patients) received salvage particle radiotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 15.7 months, four patients with second primary sarcoma died. The 1- and 2-year OS, PFS, LRFS, and DMFS rates for the entire cohort were 92.9% vs 90%, 73.6% vs 57.4%, 88.4% vs 78.9%, and 84.6% vs 76.5%, respectively. Those rates for patients without prior radiotherapy were 100% vs 100%, 82.1% vs 65.8%, 93.6% vs 85.3%, and 88.4% vs 79.5%, respectively. Multivariate analyses revealed that re-irradiation was an independent prognostic factor for both LRFS and PFS (P = 0.015 and 0.037, respectively). In addition, gross tumor volume (GTV) was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (P = 0.048). One patient experienced Grade 3 acute toxicity (oral mucositis); another experienced Grade 4 acute event (hemorrhage) which required embolization. He lately died from hemorrhage (Grade 5) at 3.4 months after the completion of treatment. No patient experienced radiation-induced acute/late toxicity of >= Grade 2 otherwise. Conclusion(s): With few observed acute/late toxicities, IMPT/IMCT provided effective short-term tumor control in our patients with HNS. Further investigations, preferably in a prospective fashion, will be required to confirm the efficacy and toxicities of IMPT/IMCT in this group of patients.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

3545,"Residential radon exposure and esophageal cancer. An ecological study from an area with high indoor radon concentration (Galicia, Spain) PURPOSE: To analyze the correlation between municipal esophageal cancer relative risk and municipal residential radon concentration in a high radon emission Spanish area., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed an ecological study at municipal level in Galicia, Spain. For each municipality we estimated the median radon concentration and the relative risk (RR) for esophageal cancer mortality for males and females. The relative risk was calculated using a Bayesian approach. Homes with data on radon concentration were selected through stratified random sampling. To be included, each municipality had to have at least five radon measurements. We obtained Spearman's correlations for median residential radon concentration and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males and females, separately., RESULTS: We included 129 municipalities, covering the 79% of Galician population. 14% of municipalities had radon concentrations above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) action level. We found a statistically significant correlation among residential radon and esophageal cancer mortality RR for males (p < 0.001), but not for females. When the analysis was restricted to municipalities with more than 15 radon measurements the correlation pattern remained., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study analyzing the association between residential radon and esophageal cancer. The results suggesting a possible effect of residential radon on esophageal cancer mortality should be explored through more robust epidemiological designs such as case-control studies.",Excluded

The purpose of the study is to evaluate feasibility of correction of extrusion and correlation of various factors affecting the postoperative extrusion correction and outcomes in all degenerative medial meniscus posterior roots (MMPRTs). Method(s): A retrospective study of patients who presented with degenerative MMPRTs following trivial incident (Jun 2014 and Aug 2018) and included isolated Laprade type 2 root tear with extrusion in MRI. Patients with ligament injuries, tricompartmental arthritis, malalignment (> 50) and irreparable meniscal tears excluded. All patients underwent arthroscopic trans-tibial tunnel suture pull-out repair. A screening MRI was taken at a 6-month follow-up and functional scores (IKDC and Lysholm's) at final follow-up. The effects of age, gender, duration of symptoms, hip-knee-ankle angle on weight-bearing X-rays, ICRS grading of cartilage status, and MRI data (extrusion distance, tunnel location and healing status of meniscus) on outcomes were analysed. Result(s): MMPRT (n = 54) with a mean follow-up of 34.6 months (24-48). Mean functional outcomes improved postoperatively IKDC (43.40 +/- 5.16-78.65 +/- 5.11, p < 0.001) and Lysholm's (65.27 +/- 4.28-83.16 +/- 4.83, p < 0.001) scores at final follow-up. 57.4% (31) had good correction of extrusion, 3.7% (2) no correction and 38.8% (21) showed increase in extrusion postoperatively. Of all the factors we explored, age, ICRS (low grade) and knee varus (less 2.5 degree) affected extrusion correction. Patients with healed (41 patients), partially healed (9 patients) and anatomic tunnel placement (46 patients) had better extrusion correction than those with non-healing (4 patients) and non-anatomical tunnel (8 patients). Conclusion(s): Patients younger than 50 years, with low grade cartilage damage (ICRS 1, 2), lower KL grade and varus alignment (< 2.50) had good correction of extrusion. Correction of extrusion/progression of extrusion did not influence the clinical outcome at the short-term. The progression of meniscal extrusion is inevitable even after successful repair in elderly and high-risk patients.

4307,"[Low-dose CT in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin] PURPOSE: To define the value of low-dose multislice CT in a clinical setting for early detection of pneumonia in neutropenic patients with fever of unknown origin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five neutropenic patients suffering from fever of unknown origin with normal chest X-ray underwent unenhanced low-dose CT of the chest (120 kV, 10 eff. mAs, collimation 4 x 1 mm) using a multislice CT scanner. Axial und frontal slices with a thickness of 5 mm were calculated. If no pneumonia was found, standard antibiotics were given and a repeated examination was performed if fever continued. In case of pneumonia, antimycotic therapy was added and a follow-up CT was performed within one week. Regression or progression of pneumonia at follow-up served as evidence of pneumonia; lowering of fever within 48 h or inconspicuous follow-up CT was regarded as absence of pneumonia., RESULTS: Ten of 35 patients had pneumonic infiltration, which decreased or increased on follow-up CT in 3 and 6 patients, respectively. One patient revealed leucemic infiltration by bronchoalveolar lavage. Twenty-five of 35 patients had no evidence of pneumonia. Twenty of these patients were free of fever within 48 h under antibiotics; one patient died due to his basic illness. Out of 4 patients with persisting fever, 3 patients had no pneumonia on repeated examination; one patient showed disseminated micronodular infiltration. Frontal reconstructions helped to differentiate infiltration from atelectasis in 4 patients.

3636,"Reduced-dose CT: Effect on reader evaluation in detection of pulmonary embolism OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduction in radiation dose on CT detection of pulmonary embolism. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Emergency department patients were evaluated for pulmonary embolism with standard and simulated reduced-dose CT angiography. Simulated lower-dose CT angiograms obtained at 90, 45, 22, and 10 mAseff were reconstructed by mathematical addition of noise to the standard dose (180 mAseff) data from the images of 18 patients with and 20 patients without pulmonary embolism. Four radiologists blinded to the study parameters separately interpreted each CT angiogram. Dose trends for subjective measures (diagnostic certainty, image quality, and perceived technical limitations) were evaluated, test characteristics for the detection of pulmonary embolism were computed, and clot burden was measured. RESULTS. Readers indicated significant reductions in diagnostic certainty (p < 0.02) and image quality (p < 0.02) and an increase in perceived technical limitations (p < 0.01) as the simulated radiation dose was decreased. These subjective measures also showed significant adverse dose trends when the mAseff was reduced (p < 0.001). At reduced radiation doses, the sensitivity and positive predictive value for detection of pulmonary embolism diminished significantly. The sensitivity was 0.94 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); specificity, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.98); positive predictive value, 0.95 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.92); and negative predictive value, 0.99 (lower bound of 0.95 CI, 0.97). All patients had a low to moderate clot burden. CONCLUSION. Reduction in dose for CT angiography in the detection of pulmonary embolism has a significant adverse effect on readers' subjective assessment of diagnostic confidence and image quality. Detection of pulmonary embolism also decreases as the tube current dose is reduced. © American Roentgen Ray Society.",Excluded
3741,"Indications of future decreasing trends in skin-melanoma mortality among whites in the United States Trends in skin melanoma death rates during a 35-year period, 1950-84, were analyzed according to age, sex, and birth cohort for whites in the United States. In contrast to upward trends observed for older men and women (i.e., over 40), downward trends were noted for younger age groups. The risk of dying from skin melanoma appears to have peaked for male cohorts born during the 1950s and for female cohorts born during the 1930s. Assuming no future environmental or lifestyle changes, the upward trend in age-adjusted mortality rates, which averaged 2 to 3% per annum since 1950, is projected to discontinue and bend downward by the second decade of the 21st century. Skin melanoma incidence data, which was limited to a series of 12 years (1973-84) and inadequate for cohort analyses, were included to demonstrate that trends in age-specific rates were comparable with those observed for mortality during the overlapping time period. Incidence trends according to anatomical site are also described.

Method(s): Forty-eight patients (11 SCLC, 37 non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) receiving reRT to the thorax were identified; 44 (92%) received reRT by intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Palliative responses, survival outcomes, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Result(s): NSCLC patients received a median of 30 Gy in a median of 10 fractions, whereas SCLC patients received a median of 37.5 Gy in a median of 15 fractions. Median survival for the entire cohort from reRT was 4.2 months. Median survival for NSCLC patients was 5.1 months, versus 3.1 months for the SCLC patients (P=0.15). In NSCLC patients, multivariate analysis demonstrated that Karnofsky performance status>=80 and higher radiation dose were associated with improved survival following reRT, and 75% of patients with symptoms experienced palliative benefit. In SCLC, 4 patients treated with the intent of life prolongation for radiographic recurrence had a median survival of 11.7 months. However, acute toxicities and new disease symptoms limited the duration of palliative benefit in the 7 symptomatic SCLC patients to 0.5 months. Conclusion(s): ReRT to the thorax for locoregionally recurrent NSCLC can provide palliative benefit, and a small subset of patients may experience long-term survival. Select SCLC patients may experience meaningful survival prolongation after reRT, but reRT for patients with symptomatic recurrence and/or extrathoracic disease did not offer meaningful survival or durable symptom benefit.

3451,"Concentrated adipose tissue infusion for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis: clinical and histological observations Purpose: Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by articular cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone sclerosis. OA can benefit of non-surgical treatments with collagenase-isolated stromal vascular fraction (SVF) or cultured-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs). To avoid high manipulation of the lipoaspirate needed to obtain ASCs and SVF, we investigated whether articular infusions of autologous concentrated adipose tissue are an effective treatment for knee OA patients. Method(s): The knee of 20 OA patients was intra-articularly injected with autologous concentrated adipose tissue, obtained after centrifugation of lipoaspirate. Patients' articular functionality and pain were evaluated by VAS and WOMAC scores at three, six and 18 months from infusion. The osteogenic and chondrogenic ability of ASCs contained in the injected adipose tissue was studied in in vitro primary osteoblast and chondrocyte cell cultures, also plated on 3D-bone scaffold. Knee articular biopsies of patients previously treated with adipose tissue were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed to detect cell differentiation and tissue regeneration. Result(s): The treatment resulted safe, and all patients reported an improvement in terms of pain reduction and increase of function. According to the osteogenic or chondrogenic stimulation, ASCs expressed alkaline phosphatase or aggrecan, respectively. The presence of a layer of newly formed tissue was visualized by IHC staining and SEM. The biopsy of previously treated knee joints showed new tissue formation, starting from the bone side of the osteochondral lesion. Conclusion(s): Overall our data indicate that adipose tissue infusion stimulates tissue regeneration and might be considered a safe treatment for knee OA.Copyright © 2018, SICOT aisbl.",Excluded
4497,"Surgeon-performed Ultrasound for the Staging of Acute Diverticulitis: Preliminary Results of a Prospective Study INTRODUCTION: Although contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CEACT) is still considered the gold standard for the assessment of suspected acute diverticulitis, in recent years the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has been spreading more and more in this setting. The aim of this study is to compare CEACT to POCUS for the diagnosis and staging of suspected acute diverticulitis. METHOD(S): This is a prospective study conducted on 55 patients admitted to the Emergency Department of two Italian Hospitals with a clinical suspicion of acute diverticulitis between January 2014 and December 2017. All the patients included underwent POCUS first and CEACT immediately afterwards, with the diagnosis and the staging reported according to the Hinchey (H) classification modified by Wasvary et al. Three surgeons performed all the POCUS and the same two radiologists retrospectively analyzed all the CEACT images. The radiologists were informed of the clinical suspicion but unaware of the POCUS findings. The CEACT was used as the gold standard for the comparison. RESULT(S): The final cohort included 30 (55%) females and 25 (45%) males. The median age was 62 (24-88) and the median body mass index was 26 (19-42).Forty-six out of 55 patients had a confirmed diagnosis of acute diverticulitis on both POCUS and CEACT, whereas in seven patients the diagnosis was not confirmed by both methods. POCUS sensitivity and specificity were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS positive and negative predictive values were 98% and 88% respectively. POCUS accuracy was 96%.POCUS classified 33 H1a, 11 H1b, 1 H2 and 1 H3 acute diverticulitis. This staging was confirmed in all patients but three (93%) by CEACT. CONCLUSION(S): Point-of-care ultrasound appeared a reliable technique for the diagnosis and the staging of clinically suspected H1 and H2 acute diverticulitis.

Patients with resectable rectal cancer were randomised to total mesorectal excision with or without preoperative radiotherapy (PRT). Preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months postoperatively, SD scores were filled out in questionnaires. Possible risk factors for postoperative deterioration of sexual functioning, including patients' demographics, tumour-specific factors and treatment-related variables, were investigated with univariate and multivariable regression analyses. Increase in general SD, erectile dysfunction and ejaculatory problems were reported by 76.4, 79.8 and 72.2 percent of the male patients, respectively. Risk factors were nerve damage, blood loss, anastomotic leakage, PRT and the presence of a stoma. In female patients, increase in general SD, dyspareunia and vaginal dryness were reported by 61.5, 59.1 and 56.6 percent, respectively. This was associated with PRT and the presence of a stoma. SD occurs frequently after rectal cancer treatment and is caused by surgical (nerve) damage with an additional effect of PRT.

It is well known that nitric oxide (NO) is the main gas mediator of penile and clitoris erection. In addition, the lightest and diffusible gas molecule hydrogen (H2) has been shown to improve erectile dysfunction (ED), testis injuries, sperm motility in male, preserve ovarian function, protect against uterine inflammation, preeclampsia, and breast cancer in female. Mechanistically, H2 has strong abilities to attenuate excessive oxidative stress by selectively reducing cytotoxic oxygen radicals, modulate immunity and inflammation, and inhibit injuries-induced cell death. Therefore, H2 is a novel bioactive gas molecule involved in modulating sexual organs homeostasis.Copyright © 2021 Yaxing Zhang et al.",Excluded
4053,"Analysis by alkaline comet assay of cancer patients with severe reactions to radiotherapy: Defective rejoining of radioinduced DNA strand breaks in lymphocytes of breast cancer patients Therapeutic exposure to ionising radiation reveals inter-individual variations in normal tissue responses. To examine whether a defect in DNA repair capacity might be involved in such hypersensitive phenotypes, we analysed, using the alkaline comet assay, the response as a function of time to in vitro irradiation at 5 Gy of lymphocytes from 17 breast cancer and 9 Hodgkin's disease patients who developed severe reactions to radiotherapy in comparison with 22 patients with 'average' reactions and 24 healthy donors. A difference between breast cancer over-reactors and both patients with normal reactions and healthy donors was observed 30 and 60 min after exposure. A subgroup of breast cancer over-reactors (7/17) reproducibly demonstrated increased levels of residual damage. When the kinetic analyses were prolonged to 120 min, results were in favour of delayed kinetics of rejoining in these patients. Among Hodgkin's disease over-reactors, only one patient showed defective repair. Interestingly, all patients with the most severe complications (grade 4 RTOG/EORTC), i.e., 5 breast cancer and 1 Hodgkin's disease, showed impaired rejoining. Our results suggest that impairment in DNA strand break processing may be associated, in specific subgroups of breast cancer patients, with an individual risk of major toxicity of radiation therapy. Thus, the alkaline comet assay appears to be useful for documenting the DNA repair phenotype in cancer patients.",Included

4231,"Humanized mouse model: Hematopoietic stemcell transplantation and tracking using short tandem repeat technology Introduction: Models of mice carrying a human immune system, so-called humanized mice, are used increasingly as preclinical models to bridge the gap between model organisms and human beings. Challenges of the humanized mouse model include finding suitable sources for human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and reaching sufficient engraftment of these cells in immunocompromised mice. Method(s): In this study, we compared the use of CD34+ HSC from cord blood (CB) vs HSC from adult mobilized peripheral blood. Furthermore, we developed a simple and highly specific test for donor identification in humanized mice by applying the detection method of short tandem repeats (STR). Result(s): It was found that, in vitro, CB-derived and adult HSC show comparable purity, viability, and differentiation potential in colony-forming unit assays. However, in vivo, CB-derived HSC engrafted to a significantly higher extent in NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rgammatm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice than adult HSC. Increasing the cell dose of adult HSC or using fresh cells without cryopreservation did not improve the engraftment rate. Interestingly, when using adult HSC, the percentage of human cells in the bone marrow was significantly higher than that in the peripheral blood. Using the STR-based test, we were able to identify and distinguish human cells from different donors in humanized mice and in a humanized allogeneic transplantation model. Conclusion(s): From these findings, we conclude that adult mobilized HSC are less suitable for generating a humanized immune system in mice than CB-derived cells.Copyright © The Authors.

4157,"Image-guided stereotactic ablative radiotherapy for the liver: a safe and effective treatment AIMS: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a non-invasive treatment option for inoperable patients or patients with irresectable liver tumors. Outcome and toxicity were evaluated retrospectively in this single-institution patient cohort., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014, 39 lesions were irradiated in 33 consecutive patients (18 male, 15 female, median age of 68 years). All the lesions were liver metastases (n = 34) or primary hepatocellular carcinomas (n = 5). The patients had undergone four-dimensional respiration-correlated PET-CT for treatment simulation to capture tumor motion. We analyzed local control with a focus on CT-based response at three months, one year and two years after treatment, looking at overall survival and the progression pattern., RESULTS: All patients were treated with hypofractionated image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy. The equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions varied from 62.5 Gy to 150 Gy, delivered in 3-10 fractions (median dose 93.8 Gy, alpha/beta = 10). The CT-based regression pattern three months after radiotherapy revealed partial regression in 72.7% of patients with a complete remission in 27.3% of the cases. The site of first progression was predominantly distant. One- and two-year overall survival rates were 85.4% and 68.8%, respectively. No toxicity of grade 2 or higher according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 was observed., CONCLUSION: SABR is a safe and efficient treatment for selected inoperable patients or irresectable tumors of the liver. Future studies should combine SABR with systemic treatment acting in synergy with radiation, such as immunological interventions or hypoxic cell radiosensitizers to prevent distant relapse.

4010,"Predicting severe acute radiation pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving postoperative radiotherapy: Development and internal validation of a nomogram based on the clinical and dose-volume histogram parameters Background and purpose: Postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) can potentially lead to radiation pneumonitis. We aim to develop a nomogram predicting the severe acute radiation pneumonitis (SARP, grade >=3) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving PORT. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical and dose-volume histogram (DVH) factors were collected from 109 patients between 2006 and 2017. The endpoint was the development of SARP within 3 months after PORT. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the prognostic value of each factor in predicting SARP. Nomogram was generated based on multivariate regression coefficients. Area under the ROC curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analyses (DCA) were conducted to validate the model. Result(s): Univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that total lung mean dose (tlMD) (OR: 1.003, 95%CI: 1.001-1.006, p = 0.013), percentage of ipsilateral lung volume receiving >=5 Gy (ilV5) (OR: 1.084, 95%CI: 1.020-1.151, p = 0.009), and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) (OR: 4.091, 95%CI: 1.331-12.572, p = 0.014) were independent prognosticators of SARP and were included in the nomogram. ROC curves revealed the AUC of the nomogram was 0.842, which was much higher than any factor alone (tlMD: 0.769; ilV5: 0.744; CCRT: 0.661). Calibration curves showed favorable consistency between the predicted SARP and the actual observation. DCA showed satisfactory positive net benefits of the model among most of the threshold probabilities, indicating great clinical effect. Conclusion(s): We identified that the tlMD (>10.8 Gy), ilV5 (>64.9%), and CCRT could predict SARP among patients with NSCLC receiving PORT. Combining clinical and DVH parameters, a nomogram was first built and validated, showing its potential value in practice.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

Fourteen patients underwent combined 3-port pars plana vitrectomy and TSS PC-IOL implantation (vitrectomy group), and 104 patients underwent TSS PC-IOL implantation only (nonvitrectomy group). All surgeries were performed under the same coaxial illuminated microscope. All diagnoses were confirmed through careful fundus examination and fluorescein angiography (FA)., RESULTS: Diagnoses of retinal phototoxic maculopathy were established in 10 (8.47%) of 118 TSS PC-IOL implantation cases. Phototoxic maculopathy occurred more frequently in the vitrectomy group than in the nonvitrectomy group (6/14 versus 4/104, respectively; P < 0.001, chi-square = 24.21). Affected patients reported decreased vision and were found to have coarse alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In 5 of the phototoxic maculopathy cases (50%), the visual acuity was 20/200 or worse., CONCLUSION: Operating microscope light-induced retinal phototoxic maculopathy can occur more frequently after TSS PC-IOL implantation than after casual cataract surgery, especially when TSS PC-IOL is combined with vitrectomy surgery. Surgeons should take precautions to prevent retinal phototoxicity after TSS PC-IOL implantation and vitrectomy.",Excluded

Overall image quality was evaluated using a 4-point scale. Vascular enhancement (HU) was then assessed in each patient by manually drawing multiple ROIs in lumen of 7 segments of the whole aorta. The radiation dose exposure of both groups was calculated and all data were compared and statistically analyzed., RESULTS:: On low-kV protocol, higher mean attenuation values were achieved in all the measurements as compared to standard protocol. There were no significant differences in the image quality evaluation in both groups. Mean radiation dose value of study group was significantly lower than in control group (reduction of 20%)., CONCLUSION: : Low kV and low CM volume CTA protocols allow TAVI planning to be carried out with high quality images and a significant reduction in the radiation dose as compared to the standard CTA protocol., ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: : Low-kV CTA for pre-operative assessment of patients candidates for TAVI, permits to achieve a significant reduction of radiation dose exposure and contrast medium volume, reducing the risk of contrast induced nephropathy.",Excluded
3692,"Characteristics of induced mutations in offspring derived from irradiated mouse spermatogonia and mature oocytes The exposure of germ cells to radiation introduces mutations in the genomes of offspring, and a previous whole-genome sequencing study indicated that the irradiation of mouse sperm induces insertions/deletions (indels) and multisite mutations (clustered single nucleotide variants and indels). However, the current knowledge on the mutation spectra is limited, and the effects of radiation exposure on germ cells at stages other than the sperm stage remain unknown. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing experiments to investigate the exposure of spermatogonia and mature oocytes. We compared de novo mutations in a total of 24 F1 mice conceived before and after the irradiation of their parents. The results indicated that radiation exposure, 4 Gy of gamma rays, induced 9.6 indels and 2.5 multisite mutations in spermatogonia and 4.7 indels and 3.1 multisite mutations in mature oocytes in the autosomal regions of each F1 individual. Notably, we found two types of deletions, namely, small deletions (mainly 1~12 nucleotides) in non-repeat sequences, many of which showed microhomology at the breakpoint junction, and single-nucleotide deletions in mononucleotide repeat sequences. The results suggest that these deletions and multisite mutations could be a typical signature of mutations induced by parental irradiation in mammals.",Excluded
4581,"Histopathological examination of spine tumors after treatment with radiosurgery OBJECTIVE Increased survival time after diagnosis of neoplastic disease has resulted in a gradual increase in spine tumor incidence. Radiosurgery is frequently a viable alternative to operative management in a population with severe medical comorbidities. The authors sought to assess the histopathological consequences of radiosurgery in the subset of patients progressing to operative intervention. METHODS Eighteen patients who underwent radiosurgery for spine tumors between 2008 and 2014 subsequently progressed to surgical treatment. A histopathological examination of these cases was performed. Indications for surgery included symptomatic compression fractures, radiographic instability, and symptoms of cord or cauda equina compression. Biopsy samples were obtained from the tumor within the radiosurgical zone in all cases and were permanently fixated. Viable tumor samples were stained for Ki 67. RESULTS Fifteen patients had metastatic lesions and 3 patients had neurofibromas. The mean patient age was 57 years. The operative indication was symptomatic compression in 10 cases (67%). The most frequent metastatic lesions were breast cancer (4 cases), renal cell carcinoma (3), prostate cancer (2), and endometrial cancer (2). In 9 (60%) of the 15 metastatic cases, histological examination of the lesions showed minimal evidence of inflammation. Viable tumor at the margins of the radiosurgery was seen in 9 (60%) of the metastatic cases. Necrosis in the tumor bed was frequent, as was fibrotic bone marrow. Vascular ectasia was seen in 2 of 15 metastatic cases, but sclerosis with ectasia was frequent. No evidence of malignant conversion was seen in the periphery of the lesions in the 3 neurofibroma cases. In 1 case of neurofibroma, the lesion demonstrated some small areas of remnant tumor in the radiosurgical target zone. CONCLUSIONS This case series demonstrates important histopathological characteristics of spinal lesions treated by SRS. Regions with the highest exposure to radiation appear to be densely necrotic and show little evidence of tumor growth, whereas peripheral regions distant from the radiation dosage are more likely to demonstrate viable tumor in malignant and benign neoplasms. Physiological tissue appears to be similarly affected. With additional investigation, a more homogenized field of hypofractionated radiation exposure may allow for tumor obliteration with relative preservation of critical anatomical structures.",Excluded

One hundred and thirty-one consecutive patients suffering from oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma were included in this study from July 1989 to April 2005. Follow-up was closed in May 2010. The mean follow-up for survivors was 110.26 +/- 47.42 months. Patients were staged following the TNM classification. Patients in tumour stages I and II were referred to surgery. Patients in stages III-IV were referred to postoperative radiotherapy. Radiation therapy was administered up to a mean dose of 62.13 +/- 7.74 Gy in 1.8-2 Gy fractions. IGF-1R expression was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. IGF-1R was expressed in 101 patients (77.1%). IGF-1R expression was related to tumour grade (P = 0.012). Tumour stage was the most important prognostic factor for survival. Low (negative and fairly) IGF-1R tumour expression was correlated to better long-term Local Disease Free Survival (P = 0.016), Disease-Free Survival (P = 0.029), and Survival (P = 0.009) in patients achieving tumour stages III-IV. Low IGF-1R expression was related to better long-term control in patients suffering locally advanced oral carcinoma. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
4304,"Neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiation therapy, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a difficult malignancy to treat surgically because of its anatomical location and its frequent association with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by liver transplantation in lymph node-negative patients has been advanced by select liver transplant centers for the treatment of patients with unresectable disease. This approach has most commonly used external-beam radiotherapy in combination with biliary brachytherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Our center recently embarked on a protocol using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) followed by capecitabine in lymph node-negative patients until liver transplantation. We, therefore, retrospectively determined the tolerability and pathological response in this pilot study. During a 3-year period, 17 patients with unresectable hilar CCA were evaluated for treatment under this protocol. In all, 12 patients qualified for neoadjuvant therapy and were treated with SBRT (50-60 Gy in 3-5 fractions over the course of 2 weeks). After 1 week of rest, capecitabine was initiated at 1330 mg/m2/day, and it was continued until liver transplantation. During neoadjuvant therapy, there were 35 adverse events in all, with cholangitis and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia being the most common. Capecitabine dose reductions were required on 5 occasions. Ultimately, 9 patients were listed for transplantation, and 6 patients received a liver transplant. The explant pathology of hilar tumors showed at least a partial treatment response in 5 patients, with extensive tumor necrosis and fibrosis noted. Additionally, high apoptotic indices and low proliferative indices were measured during histological examinations. Eleven transplant-related complications occurred, and the 1-year survival rate after transplantation was 83%. In this pilot study, neoadjuvant therapy with SBRT, capecitabine, and liver transplantation for unresectable CCA demonstrated acceptable tolerability. Further studies will determine the overall future efficacy of this therapy. Liver Transpl 20:81-88, 2014. © 2013 AASLD. © 2013 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded

Material(s) and Method(s): Institutional ethics committee approval was given, and informed consent was obtained. One hundred twenty patients were enrolled in a prospective study and divided into three groups: iomeprol group, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging group (gadoterate meglumine), and renal scintigraphy group (99mTc). They randomly received Nacetylcysteine, physiologic saline, or sodium bicarbonate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, Kaplan- Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis were used. Result(s): In the MR imaging and renal scintigraphy groups, there were significant changes in serum creatinine and NGAL levels, and there were no cases of CIN. In the iomeprol group, an early rise in NGAL was found, while serum creatinine level changes occurred 24 hours after contrast material administration. At ROC analysis, NGAL showed high sensitivity and specificity (serum NGAL: area under the curve, 0.995; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.868, 0.992; urinary NGAL: area under the curve, 0.992; 95% CI: 0.925, 1.000) in identifying CIN 8 hours after iomeprol administration.

3751,"HPRT-mutant frequency and lymphocyte characteristics of workers exposed to ionizing radiation on a sporadic basis: a comparison of two exposure indicators, job title and dose Using the clonal HPRT-mutant frequency assay, mutant frequencies of humans have been shown to rise following exposure to large doses of mutagens during radiotherapy, chemotherapy or after an atom bomb explosion. Success in relating mutant frequencies to exposure to high levels of mutagens has encouraged researchers to examine the effects of lower doses, such as those found among workers exposed at their jobs. In order to relate low doses of mutagens to biological effects, accurate characterization of exposure is critical, but most occupational studies are forced to use gross measures of exposure derived from job title or professional judgments as to potential exposure. Mutant frequencies and other relevant lymphocyte characteristics of 58 industrial workers were related to exposure status in two ways. When workers were classed as ""exposed"" or ""unexposed"" to ionizing radiation, no difference in any biological variable was seen between the two groups. When dosimeter readings were used as the exposure indicator, significant relationships appeared between dose and mutant frequency and CD4/CD8 lymphocyte subpopulation ratios. Mutant frequency was also positively related to age and smoking status. The time course of exposure and of appearance of mutant cells is discussed and it is suggested that this relationship receive attention in occupational studies of genotoxic effects.",Excluded

The aim of this work is to report the outcomes with the use of machined allograft CISs at C1-2. Method(s): A retrospective review of 19 patients who underwent an atlantoaxial fusion with the use of CISs was performed. All patients had instability documented with flexion and extension lateral radiographs. This instability was due to trauma, degenerative stenosis, symptomatic C1-2 arthropathy, and os odontoideum. Clinical and radiological outcomes were assessed. Fusion was determined based on a lack of hardware failure, absence of motion on flexion and extension plain X-ray films, and presence of bridging trabecular bone which was most often demonstrated by a computed tomography. Result(s): The mean age was 69.1 +/- 12.9 years. Eight patients had traumatic fractures, six patients had degenerative stenosis, two patients had C2 neuralgia due to C1-2 arthropathy, two patients had C1-2 ligamentous subluxation, and one patient had an unstable os odontoideum. The occiput or subaxial spine was included in the arthrodesis in 10 patients. Rib autograft was utilized in most patients. No patient had postoperative neurological worsening, malposition of hardware, or vertebral artery injury and there were no mortalities. The fusion rate was 95%.

The esophagectomy specimens were sampled at the resection margins, the edge of irradiated length, 1 cm from the proximal and distal edge of visible tumor, the center of the tumor, and the lymph nodes., RESULTS: Radiation change in the form of fibrosis was limited to the submucosa at the resection margins, the circular muscle layer at the edge of irradiated length, and full thickness at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Surface epithelium did not show any changes at the resection margins but did show basal cell hyperplasia at the edge of the irradiated length and ulceration at 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Endarteritis obliterans was seen only 1 cm from the edge of the visible tumor and the center of the tumor. Necrosis, intense keratin formation, and giant cell reaction were observed at the center of the tumor. When compared with the preradiotherapy biopsies, the amount of keratin in the postradiotherapy specimens was extensive. HDRILBT may cause induction of the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to stimulate differentiation toward better differentiated cells., CONCLUSIONS: HDRILBT may cause the keratin gene in the irradiated cells to induce differentiation toward better differentiated cells.

Method(s): Data for patients with recurrent HGGs who received SRT and Bv (n = 29) or Bv (n = 29) between June 2014 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received conventional radiotherapy (total, 60 Gy) before this study. SRT was administered at a median dose of 42 Gy in 3-7 fractions. The recurrence pattern was classified into 3 groups: in-field, marginal, and out-field. Result(s): The median overall survival in the SRT-Bv group was significantly longer than that in the Bv group (10.4 vs. 5.6 months; P = 0.02). In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type tumors, the SRT-Bv treatment significantly prolonged survival more than the Bv treatment (10.9 vs. 8.2 months; P = 0.01). The World Health Organization grade and presence or absence of SRT were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. Besides brain edema in 2 cases and asymptomatic subdural hematoma in 1 case, no other severe adverse effect due to SRT-Bv treatment was recorded. The pattern of recurrence was as follows: in-field, 2 cases (7%); marginal, 8 cases (28%); out-field, 11 cases (38%); no recurrence on radiologic findings, 6 cases (21%); and uncertain, 2 cases (7%).

Method(s): Seventy-six patients who underwent unenhanced computed tomography (CT) and dual-energy (DE)-CT angiography after surgical clipping of 85 intracranial aneurysms were included in the study. Diagnostic performances of VNC and TNC images were compared with respect to sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The results of quantitative and qualitative analyses were compared between VNC and TNC images. Radiation doses were also compared between VNC and TNC images. Result(s): Diagnostic performance of VNC images was lower than that of TNC images; however, addition of contrast-enhanced images improved diagnostic performance. Image noise and mean attenuation of VNC images were significantly higher than those of TNC images in the centrum semiovale, cerebellum, and pons. The quality of VNC images was excellent or sufficient (85.5% for observer 1, 85.5% for observer 2), and complete acceptance of VNC images was achieved in 64.5% for observer 1 and in 71.0% for observer 2; however, the addition of contrast-enhanced images increased the level of acceptance (92.0% for observer 1, 90.9% for observer 2). Clip artifacts were significantly lower in VNC images than in TNC images. CT dose index, dose-length product, and effective dose were significantly lower without TNC images. Conclusion(s): VNC images showed lower diagnostic performance and image quality, and higher image noise than TNC images; however, VNC images could reduce clip artifacts and radiation doses.Copyright © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded

Seventy-five patients who underwent standard contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively included. Low-dose CT reconstructions with 75%, 50%, and 25% of the original radiation dose level were generated by applying realistic reduced-dose simulation. Two blinded, independent readers assessed image quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and diagnostic confidence on each dataset. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of appendicitis and complications were calculated for each reader. Paired univariate tests were used to determine intraindividual differences., RESULTS: Among 75 subjects included in the analysis (57% female, mean age: 41 +/- 18 years), the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed appendicitis was 59%. Signal-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality of 50% and 25% reduced-dose CTs were significantly lower than the reference datasets (all P < .005). Appendicitis was correctly identified in all reference and low-dose datasets (sensitivity: 100%, negative predictive value: 100%). Presence of complications was correctly detected in all reference, 75%, and 50% datasets, but was decreased in 25% datasets (sensitivity: 77.8% and negative predictive value: 97.4%). Diagnostic confidence was high for original and 75% datasets, but significantly lower for 50% and 25% datasets (P < .001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that diagnostic accuracy in abdominal CT acquisitions acquired at 75% and 50% of radiation dose is maintained in patients with suspected appendicitis, whereas further reduction of radiation exposition is associated with decreased diagnostic performance.

The underlying hypothesis is that specific doses of eBeam will have defined detrimental effects on the different life stages. We evaluated the effects of eBeam exposure in a range of doses (0.03-0.12 kGy) on the development of the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) at various stages of its life cycle., RESULTS: Differential radiosensitivity was detected during egg development. Early and intermediate stages of eggs never hatched after exposure to a dose of 0.03 kGy, whereas a substantial portion of black-headed (i.e. late) eggs survived irradiation even at 0.12 kGy. However, further development of the hatched larvae was inhibited. Although midgut protein digestion remained intact, irradiated larvae (0.06 kGy or higher) failed to develop into normal living adults; rather, they died as pupae or abnormally eclosed adults, suggesting a detrimental effect of eBeam on metamorphosis. Emerged irradiated pupae had shorter longevity and were unable to produce any eggs at 0.06 kGy or higher. At this dose range, eggs laid by irradiated adults were not viable. eBeam treatment shortened adult longevity in a dose-dependent manner. Reciprocal crosses indicated that females were more sensitive to eBeam exposure than their male counterparts. Dissection of the female reproductive system revealed that eBeam treatment prevented formation of oocytes., CONCLUSION: eBeam irradiation has very defined effects on cowpea bruchid development and reproduction. A dose of 0.06 kGy could successfully impede cowpea burchid population expansion. This information can be exploited for post-harvest insect control of stored grains.

3988,"Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for previously untreated solitary hepatocellular carcinoma Background and Aims: Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a relatively new treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The outcomes of SABR for previously untreated solitary HCC unfit for ablation and surgical resection were evaluated. Method(s): Untreated solitary HCC patients treated with SABR were retrospectively studied. Between 2005 and 2012, 221 HCC patients underwent SABR. Among them, patients with untreated solitary HCC, treated with only SABR or SABR preceded by transarterial chemoembolization, were eligible. Based on baseline liver function and liver volume receiving >=20Gy, 35-40Gy in five fractions was prescribed to the planning target volume surface. Result(s): Sixty-three patients were eligible, with a median follow-up duration of 31.1 (range 12.0-88.1) months. No patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty patients were treated with only SABR. In 43 patients treated with SABR preceded by transarterial chemoembolization, accumulation of lipiodol in the tumor remained complete in five, a partial defect in 38 on pre-SABR computed tomography. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year local control rates were 100%, 95%, and 92%, respectively; the intrahepatic recurrence-free rates were 76%, 55%, and 36%, respectively; and the overall survival rates were 100%, 87%, and 73%, respectively. Grade 3 laboratory toxicities in the acute, subacute, and chronic phases were observed in 10, 9, and 13 patients, respectively, and ascites occurred in one patient. Conclusion(s): Local control and overall survival after SABR for untreated solitary HCC were excellent despite the candidates being unfit for resection and ablation. SABR is safe and might be an alternative to resection and ablation.Copyright © 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Excluded
4391,"PHD3-dependent hydroxylation of HCLK2 promotes the DNA damage response The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex regulatory network that is critical for maintaining genome integrity. Posttranslational modifications are widely used to ensure strict spatiotemporal control of signal flow, but how the DDR responds to environmental cues, such as changes in ambient oxygen tension, remains poorly understood. We found that an essential component of the ATR/CHK1 signaling pathway, the human homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans biological clock protein CLK-2 (HCLK2), associated with and was hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 3 (PHD3). HCLK2 hydroxylation was necessary for its interaction with ATR and the subsequent activation of ATR/CHK1/p53. Inhibiting PHD3, either with the pan-hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG) or through hypoxia, prevented activation of the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway and decreased apoptosis induced by DNA damage. Consistent with these observations, we found that mice lacking PHD3 were resistant to the effects of ionizing radiation and had decreased thymic apoptosis, a biomarker of genomic integrity. Our identification of HCLK2 as a substrate of PHD3 reveals the mechanism through which hypoxia inhibits the DDR, suggesting hydroxylation of HCLK2 is a potential therapeutic target for regulating the ATR/CHK1/p53 pathway.",Excluded
3766,"Robust femur condyle disambiguation on biplanar X-rays Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the skeleton from biplanar X-rays relies on scarce information digitalised by an operator on both frontal and lateral radiographs. In clinical routine, difficulties occur for non-skilled operators to discriminate the medial from the lateral femur condyle on the lateral view. Our study proposes an algorithm able to detect automatically a possible inversion of the two condyles by the operator at an early stage of the reconstruction process. It relies on the computation of two 3D femur surfaces, one directly from the operator digitalisation and the other from the same digitalisation with medial and lateral condyles automatically swapped. Pairs of virtual biplanar X-rays are computed for both reconstructions and the closest pair to the original X-rays is selected on the basis of similarity measures, pointing the correct 3D surface. The algorithm shows a success rate higher than 85% for both asymptomatic and pathological femurs whatever the initial condyle digitalisation of the operator, bringing automatically non-skilled operators acting in clinical routine to the level of skilled operators. This study validates moreover the proof-of-concept of automatic shape adjustments of a 3D surface on the basis of similarity measures in the process of 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays. © 2012 IPEM.",Excluded
4074,"Comparison of safety and effectiveness between the right and left radial artery approach in percutaneous coronary intervention Introduction and objectives: There is a paucity of data comparing the left radial approach (LRA) and right radial approach (RRA) for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in all-comers populations and performed by operators with different experience levels. Thus, we sought to compare the safety and clinical outcomes of the RRA and LRA during PCI in ""real-world"" patients with either stable angina or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Method(s): To overcome the possible impact of the nonrandomized design, a propensity score was calculated to compare the 2 radial approaches. The study group comprised 18 716 matched pairs with stable angina and 46 241 with ACS treated with PCI and stent implantation between 2014 and 2017 in 151 tertiary invasive cardiology centers in Poland (the ORPKI Polish National Registry). Result(s): The rates of death and periprocedural complications were similar for the RRA and LRA in stable angina patients. A higher radiation dose was observed with PCI via the LRA in both clinical presentations (stable angina: 1067.0 +/- 947.1 mGy vs 1007.4 +/- 983.5 mGy, P = .001; ACS: 1212.7 +/- 1005.5 mGy vs 1053.5 +/- 1029.7 mGy, P = .001). More contrast was used in LRA procedures but only in ACS patients (174.2 +/- 75.4 mL vs 167.2 +/- 72.1 mL, P = .001). Furthermore, periprocedural complications such as coronary artery dissection (0.16% vs 0.09%, P = .008), no-reflow phenomenon (0.65% vs 0.49%, P = .005), and puncture site bleeding (0.09% vs 0.05%, P = .04) were more frequently observed with the LRA in ACS patients. There was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups (P = .90). Conclusion(s): Our finding of poorer outcomes with the LRA may be related to lower operator experience with this approach. While both the LRA and RRA are safe in the setting of stable angina, the LRA was associated with a higher rate of periprocedural complications during PCI in ACS patients.

3511,"A Multiinstitutional Study on Wasted CT Scans for Over 60,000 Patients OBJECTIVE. Repeated imaging is an unnecessary source of patient radiation exposure, a detriment to patient satisfaction, and a waste of time and money. Although analysis of rates of repeated and rejected images is mandated in mammography and recommended in radiography, the available data on these rates for CT are limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS. In this retrospective study, an automated repeat-reject rate analysis algorithm was used to quantify repeat rates from 61,102 patient examinations obtained between 2015 and 2018. The algorithm used DICOM metadata to identify repeat acquisitions. We quantified rates for one academic site and one rural site. The method allows scanner-, technologist-, protocol-, and indication-specific rates to be determined. Positive predictive values and sensitivity were estimated for correctly identifying and classifying repeat acquisitions. Repeat rates were compared between sites to identify areas for targeted technologist training. RESULTS. Of 61,102 examinations, 4676 instances of repeat scanning contributed excess radiation dose to patients. Estimated helical overlap repeat rates were 1.4% (95% CI, 1.2-1.6%) for the rural site and 1.1% (95% CI, 1.0-1.2%) for the academic site. Significant differences in rates of repeat imaging required because of bolus tracking (11.6% vs 4.3%; p < 0.001) and helical extension (3.3% vs 1.8%; p < 0.001) were observed between sites. Positive predictive values ranged from 91% to 99% depending on the reason for repeat imaging and site location. Sensitivity of the algorithm was 92% (95% CI, 87-96%). Rates tended to be highest for emergent imaging procedures and exceeded 9% for certain protocols. CONCLUSION. Our multiinstitutional automated quantification of repeat rates for CT provided a useful metric for unnecessary radiation exposure and identification of technologists in need of training.",Excluded
3912,"Reciprocal translocations as an indicator for radiation exposures in the low dose range A few years back, the frequency of dicentrics was determined shortly after exposure in five accidentally exposed radiation workers. In all cases the observed dicentric yield was significantly higher in comparison with the background level, and the resulting estimated whole body doses lay between 0.2 and 0.3 Gy. Now, a number of years later (1 to 11 years), the frequency of translocations has been determined by means of the FISH technique. Chromosomes 2, 4 and 8 were painted. The measured translocation frequency lay, however, within the range of the spontaneous variation between individuals. No radiation exposure could, therefore, be proven. In two further cases, the dicentrics were determined by means of the conventional Giemsa staining technique, and the translocations by means of chromosome painting carried out on the same blood samples, which were taken about 3 and 10 years, respectively, after the radiation exposure. The dose estimates obtained on the basis of dicentric frequency using the Qdr method, and on the basis of FISH detected translocations, are compared.

4478,"Tactile influences on astronaut visual spatial orientation: human neurovestibular studies on SLS-2 Human spatial orientation in spaceflight is initially disturbed by the absence of usable graviceptor information from the otolithic organs. Experiments measuring astronaut visually induced motion (vection) strength on various flight days during the first 10 days of the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 mission demonstrated two new phenomena in addition to confirming the initial increased weighting of visual and localized tactile cues. The reliance on tactile and visual noninertial cues apparently declined after a week in space, as the crew became able to utilize their internal reference frame. Subjects also showed that even nondirectional tactile cues served as a direction anchor and inhibited visually induced roll sensation relative to a new loosely tethered test condition. Individual perceptual styles were again revealed among the four astronauts tested. The readaptation to 1 G similarly shows a period of reinterpretation of inertial and visual cues to spatial orientation. The results are discussed in terms of an internal-model representation of body orientation, with time-varying weights applied to extrinsic and intrinsic signals.",Excluded
4185,"Long term radiological features of radiation-induced lung damage PURPOSE: To describe the radiological findings of radiation-induced lung damage (RILD) present on CT imaging of lung cancer patients 12months after radical chemoradiation., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Baseline and 12-month CT scans of 33 patients were reviewed from a phase I/II clinical trial of isotoxic chemoradiation (IDEAL CRT). CT findings were scored in three categories derived from eleven sub-categories: (1) parenchymal change, defined as the presence of consolidation, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), traction bronchiectasis and/or reticulation; (2) lung volume reduction, identified through reduction in lung height and/or distortions in fissures, diaphragm, anterior junction line and major airways anatomy, and (3) pleural changes, either thickening and/or effusion., RESULTS: Six patients were excluded from the analysis due to anatomical changes caused by partial lung collapse and abscess. All remaining 27 patients had radiological evidence of lung damage. The three categories, parenchymal change, shrinkage and pleural change were present in 100%, 96% and 82% respectively. All patients had at least two categories of change present and 72% all three. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis were present in 44%, 52% and 37% of patients., CONCLUSIONS: Parenchymal change, lung shrinkage and pleural change are present in a high proportion of patients and are frequently identified in RILD. GGOs, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis are common at 12months but not diagnostic. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4080,"In vivo dosimetry during DSA of the carotid and renal arteries. Deriviation of local DRLs The Euratom directive 97/43 recommends the use of patient dose surveys in diagnostic radiology and the establishment of diagnostic reference dose levels (DRLs). The aims of this study are to perform measurements of the entrance surface dose (ESD) during diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the renal and carotid arteries using thermoluminescence dosemeters (TLDs), extraction of local DRLs, and calculation of the effective dose. Dose measurement for the staff was also performed. Dose measurements were performed on 48 participating patients. The mean effective dose was calculated to be 15.9 mSv and 8.9 mSv, for the renal and carotid DSA, respectively. The effective dose of the radiologist was calculated to be 0.022 mSv and 0.023 mSv per procedure for renal and carotid DSA respectively, when wearing a protective apron and using a movable ceiling mounted shield. Radiation dose variation depends on the physical characteristics of the patient, on the procedure preferences by radiologists and on the difficulties in conducting the procedures. The lack of DRLs for the specific examinations lead the research team to choose the DRL for DSA of the renal arteries to be 169 mGy for ESD at the pelvic region and for DSA of the carotid arteries to be 313 mGy for ESD at the region of the aortic arc.",Excluded
3626,"Cyberknife radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma Stereotactic radiosurgery is a well-established treatment modality for vestibular schwannoma. Initial reports using single-stage radiosurgery have demonstrated excellent tumor control rates. Many patients now elect to undergo radiosurgery given the potential for tumor control while avoiding the morbidity associated with microsurgical resection. In attempt to improve hearing preservation rates of single-state radiosurgery, staged frame-based radiotherapy using a 12-hour interfraction interval was used at the authors' institution and has shown a hearing preservation rate of 77% at 2 years of follow-up. With the arrival of the Cyberknife, a frameless, image-guided radiotherapy system, staged stereotactic radiotherapy for vestibular schwannoma became more practical. This article outlines the rationale and treatment protocols developed at Stanford University (California) and reports the authors' initial experience using the Cyberknife to treat vestibular schwannoma.",Excluded
4421,Cord blood transplantation using minimum conditioning regimens for patients with hematologic malignancies complicated by severe infections Patients with severe infections are thought to be ineligible for cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBT) because the conventional 5-6 day-conditioning regimens potentially makes them susceptible to fatal infections by the time neutrophil engraftment occurs. Two patients were treated with minimum conditioning regimens consisting of 30 mg/m2 fludarabin (Flu) and 2 g/m2 cyclophosphamide (CY) on day-1 and total body irradiation (TBI) of 2 or 4 Gy on day -1 or 0 followed by single unit CBT. The reasons for adopting such weak regimen were febrile neutropenia due to the rejection of the first cord blood (CB) graft given to a patient with follicular lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy and pulmonary aspergillosis in another patient with AML who relapsed after CBT. The AML patient received 40 mg/m2 of melphalan on day-2 to reduce the leukemia burden. Both patients achieved 100% donor chimerism by day 19 and day 20 after CBT without an apparent exacerbation of the infections and remained in remission at 23 and 18 months after the CBT. These findings suggest that the 1-2 day regimens excluding antihuman thymocyte globulin may be sufficiently potent to ensure engraftment of CB in immunocompromised patients and safely administered even when patients are complicated by active infections. © 2008 The Japanese Society of Hematology.,Excluded
4579,"Online exhaled gas measurements for radiotherapy patients by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry The present study assessed whether exhaled breath analysis using proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) could screen for radiation exposure. As the intensity of proton transfer reaction reagent ion H3(16)O(+) can be calculated with the intensity of H3(18)O(+), the intensity of H3(18)O(+) was monitored to observe the stability of the PTR-MS instrument during the experiment. The PTR-MS was applied for detecting the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the exhaled breath from 42 radiotherapy patients and other 61 patients who had not received radiotherapy. All patients were enrolled in the local cancer hospital. In the experiment, the subjects breathe slowly to the PTR-MS through a direct inlet system without any sampling bag or tube. The breath mass spectrometric data was statistically analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis to find the characteristic ions of radiation exposure. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was applied for a combination of the characteristic ions. The PTR-MS instrument was stable as the intensity of reaction ion H3(16)O(+) was maintained in 1.1%. Through statistically analysis, we found 6 kinds of characteristic ions of radiation exposure, specifically mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 93, m/z 41, m/z 102, m/z 79, m/z 131, and m/z 143. The sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate) were 78.6% and 82.0% respectively. The integrated area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869.

4001,"The role of FDG-PET/CT in detection of gastric cancer recurrence AIM: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively determine the efficacy and usefulness of 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in detecting and re-staging recurrent gastric cancer patients with clinical or radiological suspicion of recurrence. METHOD(S): This retrospective study has been conducted on 41 patients who were treated gastrectomy and postoperatively radiotherapy or/and chemotherapy. Histopathologic diagnosis revealed 2 signet ring cell carcinoma, and 39 adenocancer. All of the patients referred to our department for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up.27 out of 41 were male and 14 female. The mean age was 58+/-10 years (range 30-75 years). FDG-PET/CT was applied twice to all patients. The first FDG- PET/CT was for staging and restaging. The second was for restaging due to clinical findings, tumor markers and/or radiologic suspicion of recurrence during follow-up. The standard of reference for tumor recurrence consisted of histopathologic confirmation or clinical follow-up information for at least 6 month after FDG-PET/CT examinations. RESULT(S): Cause of the first FDG-PET/CT application was due to staging in 24 patients and restaging in 17. FDG-PET/CT was negative in 14 patients and positive in 27. Out of 27, 7 patients had recurrence in gastric area, 7 patients had both recurrence and metastases and, 13 patients had metastases Histological verification was done in 11 patients who were re-operated after the first FDG-PET/CT. The second FDG-PET/CT application to 27 patients was for the assessment of the response to the treatment applied. 4 patients had full metabolic recovery, 11 had progression and 12 had regression. For 17 patients whose first FDG-PET/CT results were negative, the second FDG-PET/CT application was due to restaging for the suspicion of metastases in other radiologic modalities in 6 and high tumor marker levels in 8 patients. The results for the 17 patients were metastases in 5 and negative in 9 patients CONCLUSION(S): FDG-PET/CT is helpful in confirming the presence of recurrence particularly in patients who were highly suspicious of recurrence, because of its high positive predictability.",Excluded

The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of RT and routine endoscopic surveillance, hypothesizing that most patients are curable with RT alone. We queried a single institution database at a tertiary referral cancer center for patients with H pylori-independent GML treated with RT between 1991 and 2017. Response was assessed by follow-up endoscopies (EGDs) starting 10 to 12 weeks post-RT. Computed tomography scans were also part of the follow-up program, and positron emission tomography was added when clinically appropriate. We identified 178 patients (median age, 63 years; range, 25-89 years); 86% had stage I disease, 7% had stage II disease, and 7% had stage IV disease. Median RT dose was 3000 cGy over 20 fractions. Ninety-five percent of patients exhibited complete pathologic response on posttreatment EGD. Two patients experienced grade 3 toxicity, and 2 patients experienced in-field secondary malignancies. Over a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 9.6% experienced local failures, and 11.8% developed distant sites of disease. Five-year and 10-year overall survival were 94% and 79%, respectively, from last date of RT. RT is a highly effective and safe treatment for GML with excellent overall survival and very rare acute or late treatment-related toxicities.

4555,"Less efficient g2-m checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer in African Americans Cell cycle checkpoints play critical roles in the maintenance of genomic integrity. The inactivation of checkpoint genes by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms is frequent in all cancer types, as a less-efficient cell cycle control can lead to genetic instability and tumorigenesis. In an on-going case-control study consisting of 216 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 226 population-based controls, and 114 hospital-based controls, we investigated the relationship of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer risk. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured for 90 hours, exposed to 1.0 Gy gamma-radiation, and harvested at 3 hours after gamma-radiation treatment. gamma-Radiation-induced G2-M arrest was measured as the percentage of mitotic cells in untreated cultures minus the percentage of mitotic cells in gamma-radiation-treated cultures from the same subject. The mean percentage of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was significantly lower in cases than in population controls (1.18 versus 1.44, P < 0.01) and hospital controls (1.18 versus 1.40, P = 0.01). When dichotomized at the 50th percentile value in combined controls (population and hospital controls), a lower level of gamma-radiation-induced G2-M arrest was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans after adjusting for baseline mitotic index, age, gender, and pack-years of smoking [adjusted odd ratio (OR), 2.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.97-5.20]. A significant trend of an increased risk of lung cancer with a decreased level of G2-M arrest was observed (P(trend) = 0.02) among African Americans, with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 3.74 (95% CI, 0.98-14.3). This trend was most apparent among African American females (P(trend) < 0.01), with a lowest-versus-highest quartile adjusted OR of 11.75 (95% CI, 1.47-94.04). The results suggest that a less-efficient DNA damage-induced G2-M checkpoint is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer among African Americans. Interestingly, we observed a stronger association of DNA damage-induced G2-M arrest and lung cancer among African Americans when compared with Caucasians. If replicated, these results may provide clues to the exceedingly high lung cancer incidence experienced by African Americans.",Included
4331,"Stability and survival of bone-anchored hearing aid implant systems in post-irradiated patients Bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHAs) are based on the principle of osseointegration, which is fundamental to implant stability and survival. Previous exposure to ionising radiation may compromise this, as evidenced in relation to dental and craniofacial implants. There is a dearth of data, however, regarding BAHA implant systems in patients with previously irradiated implant sites. We sought, therefore, to investigate implant stability and survival in such patients. Patients were identified retrospectively from our electronic BAHA database. Hospital records were reviewed for demographics; operative technique; complications; and details regarding previous irradiation. Implant stability was assessed by resonance frequency analysis (RFA), generating a numerical value-implant stability quotient (ISQ). Extrapolating from dental studies, successfully loaded implants typically have ISQs of >=60. Readings were, therefore, interpreted with respect to this. Seven patients were identified for inclusion. Mean time between irradiation and implant insertion was 33 months (range 16-72 months), and mean time from implant insertion to RFA measurement was 41 months (range 3-96 months). Operatively, all patients underwent single-stage procedures under local anaesthesia. One patient suffered a Holger's grade 2 skin reaction, while two suffered significant skin flap failure, requiring revision procedures. The implant survival rate was 100 %. All ISQ values were >60, with a mean of 66.9 (95 % confidence interval 63.1-70.6). Our data support sufficient osseointegration of BAHA implant systems in post-irradiated patients, but highlight issues with wound healing. Contemporary soft tissue preservation operative techniques will likely overcome this, facilitating safe and efficacious BAHA insertion in this ever-increasing group of patients.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
4171,"Polarization Variability in Age-related Macular Degeneration SIGNIFICANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Complementary imaging techniques can be used to better characterize and quantify pathological changes associated with AMD. By assessing specific light-tissue interactions, polarization-sensitive imaging can be used to detect tissue disruption early in the disease process., PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to compare variability in central macular polarization properties in patients with nonexudative AMD and age-matched control subjects., METHODS: A scanning laser polarimeter (GDx, LDT/CZM) was used to acquire 15 x 15-degree macular images in 10 subjects diagnosed with nonexudative AMD and 10 age-matched control subjects. The coefficient of variation (COV, SD/mean) was used to quantify variability in pixel intensity in the central 3.3degree of the macula for custom images emphasizing multiply scattered light (the depolarized light image) and polarization-retaining light (the maximum of the parallel detector image). The intensity COV was compared across subject categories using paired t tests for each image type., RESULTS: The COV in the central macula was significantly higher in the AMD subject group (average, 0.221; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.157 to 0.265) when compared with matched control subjects (average 0.120; 95% CI, 0.107 to 0.133) in the depolarized light image (P = .01). The COV in the maximum of the parallel detector image was not statistically different between the two subject groups (AMD average, 0.162 [95% CI, 0.138 to 0.185]; control average, 0.137 [95% CI, 0.115 to 0.158]; P = .21)., CONCLUSIONS: Variability in multiply scattered light is higher than that of light that is more polarization preserving in patients with nonexudative AMD. Multiple scattering may act as an early indicator representing disruption to the macula in early AMD.",Excluded

PATIENTS AND METHODS In this randomized phase III trial in 16 centers, patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned to receive preoperative chemoradiotherapy, which consisted of 3 courses of gemcitabine, the second combined with 15 3 2.4 Gy radiotherapy, followed by surgery and 4 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine or to immediate surgery and 6 courses of adjuvant gemcitabine. The primary end point was overall survival by intention to treat. RESULTS Between April 2013 and July 2017, 246 eligible patients were randomly assigned; 119 were assigned to preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 127 to immediate surgery. Median overall survival by intention to treat was 16.0 months with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 14.3 months with immediate surgery (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P = .096). The resection rate was 61% and 72% (P = .058). The R0 resection rate was 71% (51 of 72) in patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy and 40% (37 of 92) in patients assigned to immediate surgery (P, .001). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was associated with significantly better disease-free survival and locoregional failure-free interval as well as with significantly lower rates of pathologic lymph nodes, perineural invasion, and venous invasion. Survival analysis of patients who underwent tumor resection and started adjuvant chemotherapy showed improved survival with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (35.2 v 19.8 months; P = .029). The proportion of patients who suffered serious adverse events was 52% versus 41% (P = .096). CONCLUSION Preoperative chemoradiotherapy for resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer did not show a significant overall survival benefit. Although the outcomes of the secondary end points and predefined subgroup analyses suggest an advantage of the neoadjuvant approach, additional evidence is required.Copyright © 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology",Excluded
3523,"Bone mineral density, vertebral fractures and their determinants in ankylosing spondylitis Background Osteoporosis responsible for loss of bone strength and vertebral fracture (VF) rates ranged from 0% to 18% have been reported in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Objectives In this study we examined the prevalence of low bone mineral density (BMD) and VF in patients with AS (modified New York criteria), and investigated the associations between BMD or VF and demographic, body composition or disease-related parameters. Methods Skeletal and body composition assessment included dual X-ray Absortiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine, hip and total body and radiographs of the spine. The presence of VF was established by the Genant's semi-quantitative method. Results A total of 79 AS patients, 65 males and 14 females with mean age of 43 and 49 years, respectively and with a mean disease duration of 10 years were included. Mean Z score BMD (SD below the age- and gender-matched mean reference value) were slightly decreased only in male patients, both at lumbar spine and total hip (-0,4 p=0,05; -0,3 p<0,01), while mean total body Z score BMD were positive in both genders (female +1,2 p<0,05; male +0,7 p<0,001), independent of the presence of syndesmophytes. Z score BMD values at both total hip and lumbar spine were directly and significantly (p<0.01) associated with body mass index (BMI, Kg/m2); Z score BMD were significantly correlated with both fat and lean mass (kg), measured by DXA, only at hip sites. Z score BMD were significantly lower in the 36 patients with syndesmophytes and in those (19%) with peripheral joints involvement. Despite reasonably preserved BMD values at least one VF was identified in 31% of males and 14% of females; most VF were located at thoracic-lumbar transition and were mild wedge fractures. The presence of VF was not associated with BMD values (ANOVA) but rather with peripheral joints involvement (chi-square test, p<0.01), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (logistic regression, p<0,01), and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (p<0,01). Conclusions In this study we found that BMD is relatively well preserved in AS patients. The total body BMD values above the normal range suggest that the overall bone formation might be somewhat increased despite the propensity to decreased mobility. VF are very common particularly in male AS patients: its occurrence is unrelated with BMD values while it is significantly correlated with clinical parameters of disease activity and functional impairment.",Excluded
3729,"Impact of fapi-pet/ct on target volume definition in radiation therapy of locally recurrent pancreatic cancer (1) Background: A new radioactive positron emission tomography (PET) tracer uses in-hibitors of fibroblast activation protein (FAPI) to visualize FAP-expressing cancer associated fibro-blasts. Significant FAPI-uptake has recently been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer patients. Target volume delineation for radiation therapy still relies on often less precise conventional computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially in locally recurrent pancreatic cancer patients. The need for improvement in precise tumor detection and delineation led us to innovatively use the novel FAPI-PET/CT for radiation treatment planning. (2) Methods: Gross tumor volumes (GTVs) of seven locally recurrent pancreatic cancer cases were contoured by six radiation oncologists. In addition, FAPI-PET/CT was used to automatically delineate tumors. The interobserver variability in target definition was analyzed and FAPI-based automatic GTVs were compared to the manually defined GTVs. (3) Results: Target definition differed significantly between different radiation oncologists with mean dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) between 0.55 and 0.65. There was no significant dif-ference between the volumes of automatic FAPI-GTVs based on the threshold of 2.0 and most of the manually contoured GTVs by radiation oncologists. (4) Conclusion(s): Due to its high tumor to background contrast, FAPI-PET/CT seems to be a superior imaging modality compared to the current gold standard contrast-enhanced CT in pancreatic cancer. For the first time, we demonstrate how FAPI-PET/CT could facilitate target definition and increases consistency in radiation oncology in pancreatic cancer.Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

3979,"The effects of radiofrequency hyperthermia on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis: a preliminary report BACKGROUND: The clinical evidence of the efficacy of hyperthermia on osteoarthritis (OA) has not yet been clearly established. In addition, the application of a modality that can control the temperature inside the joints has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of percutaneous radiofrequency hyperthermia, which could safely raise the temperature of the body core, in patients with OA knees., METHODS: Temperature changes inside the knee joint without OA were measured during exposure to radiofrequency. Radiofrequency hyperthermia was performed on 12 OA knees by exposure to 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min, 3 times, at 1-week intervals. The clinical outcome was evaluated by use of the Lequesne index (LI) and the Japan Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scale. The osteoarthritis research society international (OARSI) responder criteria were also analyzed., RESULTS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia of 8 MHz and 200 W for 20 min increased the temperature inside the joint from 34.4 to 39.4degreeC. The LI decreased by 3.55 points from baseline during the 3 weeks. The JOA scale improved significantly during the period, reaching 86.25 points at the final examination from baseline of 67.5 points. 67% of patients had a response to the therapy according to OARSI criteria. No side effects were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Radiofrequency hyperthermia can safely increase the temperature inside the knee joint. Radiofrequency hyperthermia on OA knees provides a remarkable pain relief effect and can improve the patients' daily life. In the future, clinical studies should be performed with a protocol containing more cases, with appropriate control groups.",Excluded
3915,"Urological applications of computerized axial tomography Computerized tomography (CT scanning) of the chest and abdomen has been used as a diagnostic technique in more than 7,200 patients since 1974, 250 of whom had histological proved disorders of the genitourinary system and retroperitoneum. On the basis of this experience CT scanning has been found to be safe and effective, and offers certain advantages over conventional techniques. The number, extent and content of adrenal and renal mass lesions can be determined with relatively great accuracy. The presence and extent of metastases into the retroperitoneum, liver and chest often can be shown by CT scanning when other tests are negative. Placement of needles for aspiration, biopsy, injection of contrast medium or insertion of drainage tubes can be done accurately under computerized tomographic control. Air contrast scanning of the bladder can be of real help in staging bladder tumors, espically in obese patients. Computerized tomography in itself is non-invasive, carries a low radiation exposure comparable to other radiographic procedures and therefore, can, be valuable in following the course of patients with various diseases during and after therapy. While CT scanning will not replace other diagnostic procedures it should lead to a more judicious selection of potentially hazardous tests, such as angiography, aspiration and open biopsy.",Excluded

3853,"Evaluation of non ionizing radiation around the dielectric heaters and sealers: A case report Dielectric heaters and sealers present the most common source of occupational exposure to excessive radio frequency (RF) fields. These systems are used industrially to heat or melt dielectric materials. Nowadays, the effects of high frequency electromagnetic (EM) fields on the health have been discussed frequently but there are few health studies done for workers around dielectric heaters and sealers. In this study, the leakage fields around dielectric heaters and sealers (27.12MHz) were measured in MKE Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation, Gazi Rocket Factory and evaluated in terms of standards. It has been observed that operators exposed to same RF fields with occupational exposure limits. Many workers have health complaints, such as elevated body temperatures in the factory. Safe distances or areas for workers should be recommended in these systems. Protective measures could be implemented to minimize these exposures. Further measurements and occupational exposure studies of RF exposed women and men are needed to demonstrate the levels of exposed Radio Frequency Radiation (RFR). Precautions should therefore be taken either to reduce the leakage fields or minimise the exposed fields. 2010 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Excluded

This report provides 1- and 2-year updates to the initial publication. METHOD(S):: Patients were of age 50 years or more with invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ, tumor size <=3 cm, and negative surgical margins. After lumpectomy, patients received EBT in 10 fractions over 5 days (34 Gy total). RESULT(S):: Of the 69 patients enrolled, 62 were evaluated at 1 year and 20 patients at 2 years after treatment. At 1 year, 28 (45.2%) patients reported adverse events that were possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. Most (90%) were grade 1: manageable and typical of radiation therapy. Four events were grade 2: induration/firmness (2), field contracture (1), and seroma (1). One event was grade 3: a draining fistula at the lumpectomy site due to residual effects of a breast infection at 1 month. No recurrences have been reported. Cosmetic ratings were excellent or good in 93.4% of patients at 1 year. Most patients (69%) were energetic most or all of the time.

3558,"The clinical role of X-ray computed tomography to predict the clinical efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy Aim: To evaluate the clinical efficiency of computed tomography for diagnostics of patients with urolithiasis and the choice of treatment strategy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study was carried out at the Urological Clinic of I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University and included 1044 patients with urinary stones. The ultimate goal of this study was to predict the clinical efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy using a combination of computed tomography and densitometry. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed on ""Siemens Lithostar Plus,"" ""Siemens Modularis Uro,"" and ""Dornier Gemini"" lithotripters. Statistical analysis of clinical data included evaluation of individual sampling groups and calculation of weighted arithmetic mean (M). Result(s): The efficiency of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy has been determined primarily using X-ray analysis of the concrement outlines and the structure (homogeneous or heterogeneous) of its central zone. However, in terms of efficiency and repetition rate (the number of fragmentation procedures required for complete clearance) of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, the mean density of the concrement along the whole length of its three-dimensional structure (expressed in Hounsfield units) appeared to be the most reliable and informative predictive index in this study. Conclusion(s): The combination of computed tomography with densitometry in the treatment of patients with urolithiasis allows one (1) to determine the exact localization, size, X-ray structure, and structural density of urinary stones and (2) to predict, on the basis of densitometric data histograms, the clinical efficiency and repetition rate of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy with due regard to the X-ray structure of peripheral and central zones, and mean density (in Hounsfield units) of urinary concrements.Copyright © The Author(s) 2018.",Excluded

The aim of our study was to investigate liver morphological features in relation to alpha-isoform of smooth muscle actin expression in hepatic stellate cells in six patients treated by localized radiotherapy on the biliopancreatic area. Within the month after completion of treatment, an activation of hepatic stellate cells strictly confined to irradiated areas and coinciding with congestive changes was observed. At a later stage, collagen deposition gradually increased, replacing the congestive and destroyed areas. This new fibrotic tissue also contained numerous alpha-smooth muscle positive cells.

All patients underwent total thyroidectomy and high-dose RAI therapy. A shaving technique was conducted with the goal of leaving the smallest amount of residual tumor as possible while attempting to preserve nerve function. Clinicopathologic factors and oncologic outcomes of the patients with resected RLN (group A, n = 14) and preserved RLN (group B, n = 20) were compared., RESULTS: The two groups showed no differences in clinicopathologic factors or follow-up period. Mean dose of radioiodine therapy was 245.0 +/- 140.3 mCi (range 100-540 mCi). Permanent postoperative vocal cord paralysis after RLN shaving occurred in two patients of group B (10%). Only one patient (5%) in group B had local recurrence at the thyroid bed where the residual tumor was located. The overall recurrence rate was 35.7% (5/14) and 20.0% (4/20) in groups A and B, respectively showing no significant difference (p = 0.525).

3863,"A simple and effective daily pain management method for patients receiving radiation therapy for painful bone metastases Purpose: The incidence of painful bone metastases increases with longer survival times. Although external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is an effective palliative treatment, it often requires several days from the start of treatment to produce a measurable reduction in pain scores and a qualitative amelioration of patient pain levels. Meanwhile, the use of analgesics remains the best approach early on in the treatment course. We investigated the role of radiation therapists as key personnel for collecting daily pain scores to supplement assessments by physician and oncology nursing staff and manage pain more effectively during radiation treatment. Methods and Materials: Daily pain scores were obtained by the radiation therapists for 89 patients undertaking a total of 124 courses of EBRT for bone metastases and compared with pretreatment pain scores. The majority of patients (71%) were treated to 30 Gy (range, 20-37.5) in 10 fractions (range, 8-15 fractions). Result(s): One hundred nineteen treatment courses (96%) were completed. Pain scores declined rapidly to 37.5%, 50%, and 75% of the pretreatment levels by Days 2, 4, and 10, respectively. Pain was improved in 91% of patients with only 4% of worse pain at the end of treatment. Improved pain scores were maintained in 83% of patients at 1-month follow-up, but in 35% of them, the pain was worse than at the end of treatment. Conclusion(s): Collection of daily pain scores by radiation therapists was associated with an effective reduction in pain scores early on during EBRT of painful osseous metastases. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Material(s) and Method(s): This study was approved by the institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Images from 185 patients who underwent a BMI-based protocol and 197 patients who underwent an APSCM protocol with filtered back projection (FBP) and an APSCM protocol with sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) were retrospectively evaluated. Diagnostic performance was compared with that of conventional coronary angiography in a subgroup of 51 patients. Statistical analysis was performed by using the independent or paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, x2 statistics, linear weighted k statistics, and generalized estimating equation. Result(s): The APSCM group with SAFIRE had a significant reduction in image noise and a significant increase in CT number, contrast enhancement, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio compared with the APSCM group with FBP (P < .0001) and the BMI-based group (P < .001, except P = .002 for image noise). Image quality and diagnostic accuracy showed no significant difference between the three groups. The use of APSCM resulted in a significant reduction in radiation dose compared with the BMI-based protocol.

The experiment ""NAIAD-2020"" was carried out at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (Moscow, Russia) with the participation of six healthy women volunteers (age 30.17 +/- 5.5 years, height 1.66 +/- 0.1 m, weight 62.05 +/- 8.4 kg, BMI 22.39 +/- 2.2 kg/m2) with a natural menstrual cycle. During the study, a standard protocol was used, the same as for men, with a minimum period of time spent outside the immersion bath. Before, during and after Immersion, 22 experiments were carried out aimed at studying the neurophysiological, functional, metabolic and psychophysiological functions of the body, the results of which will be presented in future publications. The total time outside the bath for women did not exceed that for men. Systolic and diastolic pressure did not significantly change during the immersion. In the first 24 h after the end of the immersion, heart rate was significantly higher than the background values [F(4,20) = 14.67; P < 0.0001]. Changes in body temperature and water balance were consistent with the patterns found in men. No significant changes in height and weight were found during immersion. All women reported general discomfort and pain in the abdomen and back. The results of this study did not find significant risks to women's health and showed the feasibility of using this model of the effects of space flight in women of reproductive age.© Copyright © 2021 Tomilovskaya, Amirova, Nosikova, Rukavishnikov, Chernogorov, Lebedeva, Saveko, Ermakov, Ponomarev, Zelenskaya, Shigueva, Shishkin, Kitov, Riabova, Brykov, Abu Sheli, Vassilieva and Orlov.",Excluded
4190,"Radioadaptive response in human lymphocytes in vitro Exposure to low doses of radiation and/or chemicals can prime an organism to withstand the stress of a subsequent exposure to higher doses of the same agent. In the case of radiation, this phenomenon has been called radioadaptive response. Cytogenetic studies have been undertaken in human lymphocytes to investigate adaptive response (AR) to ionizing radiation, in particular to seek the role of variables such as priming dose, cell cycle stage, and age and gender of the donor. We demonstrated that pre-exposure of lymphocytes in whole blood cultures to very low doses in the range of about 1 cGy (priming or adaptive dose [AD]) reduced the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated cells induced by 100 cGy - that is, produced an AR in these cells in vitro. However, pre-exposure of cells to 10.0 cGy did not reduce the chromosomal damage (micronuclei) induced by the challenging dose (CD) of 100 cGy under the same protocol, thus exhibiting an inverse dose-response relationship. There was marked variability in the AR among the individuals investigated in the study. The extent of AR also depended on the stage of cell cycle exposed to the CD of radiation. Maximum AR was observed when CD of 100 cGy was given 4 hours after AD, 30 hours following the mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes. The least AR was observed when CD was given 48 hours after stimulation. Interestingly, AR was also found to be dependent on the age of the donor, a decrease in AR being observed with an increasing age. No significant difference in AR was observed between male and female donors. To understand the molecular events underlying AR, protein synthesis patterns were studied in human lymphocytes subjected to mitogen, heat, or radiation stress. Heat shock (45 degreeC, for 15 min) induced 7 proteins with molecular weights ranging from 40 to 80 kDa, while treatment with phytohemagglutinin (40 mug/ mL) showed induction of 2 proteins of molecular weights 38 and 48 kDa, respectively. However, exposure of human lymphocyte cultures to gamma radiation did not significantly induce synthesis of any protein, up to 800 cGy dose. Lack of induction of proteins by gamma radiation in human lymphocytes contrasts with the previous reports showing X-ray radiation-enhanced gene expression in melanoma cells and/or human tumor fibroblasts.",Included
4269,"Value of lung perfusion in stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy Objective: To investigate the value of lung perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with three dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Method(s): Eight patients with stage III NSCLC who were candidated for 3DCRT were enrolled. All the patients had PET-CT scans and SPECT scans. The imagings were accurately co-registered in the planning system. The PET-CT images were used to define the gross tumor volume, and the SPECT images were used to define a volume of perfused ""functioning"" lung (FL). The planning objective was to minimize the dose to FL. Statistical analysis was made for the difference between the two sets of 3DCRT plans. Result(s): After 3DCRT was optimized, both the percentage of whole lung volume received dose >=xGy (WLVx) and the percentage of functional lung volume received dose >=xGy (FLVx) were decreased. However, the FLVx was decreased significantly. There were significant differences in WLV10, WLV15, WLV20, WLV25, WLV30 and FLV10, FLV15, FLV20, FLV25, FLV30 between before and after the 3DCRT was optimized (P=0.001, 0.002, 0.014, 0.046, 0.017 and 0.000, 0.000, 0.004, 0.027, 0.023).

Materials/Methods: Between April 2003 and December 2010, 410 patients with primary or metastatic lung tumor received SBRT in Kyushu University Hospital, and 47 patients developed local recurrence after SBRT. Fractionated re-irradiation was performed in 16 patients who were medically inoperable or refused surgery. The median age of 16 patients was 80 years (range 52- 88 years). Fourteen patients were male, and two were female. Thirteen patients had primary lung cancer, and three had metastatic lung tumor. The median tumor size was 41 mm (range 19 - 66 mm) and three patients had regional lymph node metastases. Radiation dose ranged from 60 to 70 Gy at 1.8 - 2 Gy per fraction. Concurrent chemotherapy was given in six patients. Result(s): Median follow-up was 10.2 months (range 1.6 - 21.2 months). Local re-recurrence was observed in 8 patients. Five patients died of recurrence and one patient died from other diseases. Local control rate, cause-specific survival and overall survival at 1 were 66.5%, 90.9% and 90.9%, respectively. No severe adverse events were observed in all patients during follow-up. Conclusion(s): Although the follow-up period was short, fractionated re-irradiation may be safe and an effective treatment option for local recurrence following SBRT. To confirm the effectiveness, a further accumulation of patients and longer follow-up are required.",Excluded
3608,"Identifying predictors of early growth response and adverse radiation effects of vestibular schwannomas to radiosurgery Purpose: To determine whether pre-treatment growth rate of vestibular schwannomas (VS) predict response to radiosurgery., Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of all VS patients treated with 12Gy prescription dose between September 2005 and June 2011 at our institution using the Leksell Model 4C Gamma Knife Unit was conducted. Patients who had a minimum of 12-months clinical and radiological assessment before and after radiosurgery were included in this study. Tumor growth rates were calculated using specific growth rate (SGR). Tumor volumes were measured on FIESTA-MRI scans using ITK-SNAP v2.2., Results: Following radiosurgery, twenty-seven (42.9%) patients showed a significant decrease in volume after one year, twenty-nine (46.0%) stabilized, and seven (11.1%) continued to grow. There was no correlation between VS pre-treatment SGRs with post-treatment SGRs (p= 0.34), and incidence of adverse radiation effects (ARE). The reduction in tumors' SGRs after radiosurgery was proportional to pre-treatment SGRs, although this correlation was not statistically significant (p = 0.19). Analysis of risk factors revealed a positive correlation between post-treatment SGRs and incidence of non-auditory complications, most of which were attributed to ARE (p=0.047)., Conclusion: Pre-treatment growth rate of VS does not predict tumor response to radiosurgery or incidence of ARE. VS with higher SGRs post-radiosurgery are more likely to experience ARE.Copyright © 2014 Larjani et al.",Excluded
3659,"Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, a study by the National Dermatology Centre of Colombia INTRODUCTION: Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most common malignancy in white individuals. The risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, which belongs to the family of nonmelanoma skin cancers, have not been studied in Colombia., OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma in patients at a national referral center for skin diseases in Colombia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study that evaluated sociodemographic, epidemiological, and clinical factors among 332 individuals. Risk was calculated as odds ratio (ORs) using the multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis method., RESULTS: The following risk factors were identified: family history of skin cancer (OR, 6.55; 95% CI, 1.4-28.9), living in a rural area after the age of 30 years (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.3-7.2), a lifetime working outdoors (OR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.5-5.7), smoking more than 10 cigarettes a day (OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.3-6.5), actinic conjunctivitis (OR, 2.68; 95% CI, 1.2-5.9), poikiloderma of Civatte (OR, 3.29; 95% CI, 1.7-6.1), numerous facial actinic keratoses (OR, 9.23; 95% CI, 4.9-17.1), and numerous freckles (OR, 3.68; 95% CI, 1.3-10.1)., CONCLUSIONS: We have documented clinical characteristics and personal history factors that should guide the physician in making decisions on the preventive and follow-up measures to be adopted for individuals at risk of squamous cell carcinoma.

3737,"Survival of patients with metastases of Hurthle cell thyroid carcinom Introduction: It is generally believed that patients with Hurthle cell thyroid carcinoma (HCTC) have poor prognosis. Furthermore, distant metastases represent the most frequent cause of thyroid cancer-related death of patients with HCTC. The aim of this study was to report outcomes of patients with distant metastases. Method(s): Altogether 109 patients were treated because of HCTC during the period from 1972 to 2011 in our tertiary center and 33 patients (19 females, 14 males; median age 69 years) had either initially metastatic disease (N=12; 9 females, 3 males; median age 66.5 years) or distant progression of HCTC after initial treatment (N=21; 10 females, 11 males; median age 70 years). Patients with metastases were followed for 1-201 (mean 66, median 41) months. The data on gender and age of the patients, disease history, extent of disease, morphologic characteristics, mode of therapy, outcome, and survival were collected. Statistical correlation between possible prognostic factors and cause-specific survival from time of detection of metastases was analyzed by univariate analysis and log-rank test. Result(s): Single organ and multiple organ metastases were diagnosed in 29 and 4 cases, respectively. The most common were lung metastases, followed by bone, mediastinum, kidney and liver in 26, 8, 2, 2 and 1 case, respectively. Total thyroidectomy, lobectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy and neck dissection were performed in 19, 11, 3 and 7 patients, respectively. Radioiodine (RAI) ablation of thyroid remnant was performed in 28 patients, while 27 patients had RAI therapy (median 2 times). Two or more RAI therapies were applied in 18 patients. Chemotherapy and external irradiation was used in 12 and 19 patients, respectively. Locoregional control of disease was achieved in 18/21 (86%) cases who succumbed due to HCTC. Eleven patients are alive and one lost from follow-up. Median disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ, multiple organ metastases, initially metastatic and metastatic after disease-free interval was 41, 41, 93, 36, 141, 131 and 26 months, respectively. 5-year disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ and multiple organ metastases was 42%, 46%, 57%, 32% and 100%, respectively. 10-year disease-specific survival for all patients, pulmonary, bone, single organ and multiple organ metastases was 28%, 29%, 43%, 25% and 66%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Patients with multiple and initially metastatic HCTC may have long survival after multimodal treatment.

3899,"Novel predictors of esophageal toxicity with stereotactic body radiation therapy for central lung tumors Purpose: The aim of this study is to report on clinical and dosimetric endpoints for development of esophagus toxicity (ET) in patients treated with thoracic stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Methods and materials: One hundred thirty-one patients were treated from 2006 to 2014 with SBRT for primary, recurrent, and metastatic lung tumors. Thirty-four had central lesions. We collected esophageal dosimetric data including Dmax, D1cc, D5cc, and D10cc. We recorded the percent circumferential luminal overlap at 10 Gy intervals from 10 Gy to Dmax, as well as at 24, 39, and 50 Gy, by dividing the extent of overlapping isodose by total esophagus luminal circumference (calculated by 2pi(a2 + b2/2)). Result(s): Of 34 patients included for analysis, 9 had ET and 2 of which had high-grade ET. The mean axial percent esophagus encompassed by 24, 39, and 50 Gy isodose lines of patients with ET vs. no ET was 38.9 vs. 11.5 %, 8.8 vs. 2.3 %, and 5.7 vs. 0.5 % (p = 0.04, 0.16, 0.13, respectively). Mean maximum point dose, D1cc and D5cc for patients with ET vs. those without was 31.2 Gy vs. 18.2 Gy, 25.5 Gy vs. 14.1 Gy, 19.6 Gy vs. 10.0 Gy (p = 0.045, 0.067, 0.071, respectively). Multiple treatment sites and previous thoracic radiation were significantly associated with ET. Conclusion(s): Previous thoracic RT, multiple-site irradiation, and percent esophageal overlap with 39 and 50 Gy isodose lines were most significantly associated with ET. These predictive factors can risk stratify SBRT patients for ET, and the dosimetric factors should be considered in treatment planning to decrease the risk of ET.Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Excluded
3722,"Reduction of radiation exposure during ablation of atrial fibrillation AIMS: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) during ablation of atrial fibrillation (Afib) may be associated with long fluoroscopy duration. Although most current publications report on fluoroscopy time (FT), the dose-area product (DAP) may be a more valuable parameter for depicting radiation exposure. The aim of our study was to describe a method to reduce DAP by simple means during ablation of Afib., METHODS: Patients undergoing Afib ablation using a three-dimensional (3D) mapping system were assigned to two fluoroscopy protocols: (1) standard settings with 7.5 pictures/s and collimation to the heart, fluoroscopy as needed for the convenience of the operator (standard group, SG); and (2) strict collimation to the left atrium, a frame rate of 4 pictures/s, shortened pulmonary vein angiography sequences, and maximal orientation by the 3D mapping system (redDAP group). The primary endpoint was DAP., RESULTS: The study comprised 206 patients, who were assigned to the SG (n = 101, 49 %) or to the redDAP group (n = 105, 51 %). Mean FT was significantly reduced from 29.9 +/- 11.3 min (SG) to 13.3 +/- 8.3 min (redDAP group); mean DAP was reduced by approximately 90 % from 8,690 +/- 5,727 to 837 +/- 647 cGycm(2). The groups did not differ significantly in body mass index (28.8 +/- 4.1 vs. 29.0 +/- 5.0). PVI could be achieved in 98 of 101 patients (97 %) from the SG group and in all patients (100 %) from the redDAP group. Procedure time was significantly longer in the redDAP group (160.9 +/- 35.7 vs. 138.1 +/- 34.3 min)., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure during Afib ablation procedures can be reduced with simple means by strict collimation to the left atrium, a frame rate of 4 pictures/s, shortened pulmonary vein angiography sequences, and maximal 3D orientation.",Excluded
4448,"Improved discrimination between benign and malignant LDCT screening-detected lung nodules with dynamic over static 18F-FDG PET as a function of injected dose Lung cancer mortality rate can be significantly reduced by up to 20% through routine low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening, which, however, has high sensitivity but low specificity, resulting in a high rate of false-positive nodules. Combining PET with CT may provide more accurate diagnosis for indeterminate screening-detected nodules. In this work, we investigated low-dose dynamic 18F-FDG PET in discrimination between benign and malignant nodules using a virtual clinical trial based on patient study with ground truth. Six patients with initial LDCT screening-detected lung nodules received 90min single-bed PET scans following a 10 mCi FDG injection. Low-dose static and dynamic images were generated from under-sampled list-mode data at various count levels (100%, 50%, 10%, 5%, and 1%). A virtual clinical trial was performed by adding nodule population variability, measurement noise, and static PET acquisition start time variability to the time activity curves (TACs) of the patient data. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the classification capability of standardized uptake value (SUV) and net uptake constant K i from their simulated benign and malignant distributions. Various scan durations and start times (t *) were investigated in dynamic Patlak analysis to optimize simplified acquisition protocols with a population-based input function (PBIF). The area under curve (AUC) of ROC analysis was higher with increased scan duration and earlier t *. Highly similar results were obtained using PBIF to those using image-derived input function (IDIF). The AUC value for K i using optimized t * and scan duration with 10% dose was higher than that for SUV with 100% dose. Our results suggest that dynamic PET with as little as 1 mCi FDG could provide discrimination between benign and malignant lung nodules with higher than 90% sensitivity and specificity for patients similar to the pilot and simulated population in this study, with LDCT screening-detected indeterminate lung nodules.",Excluded
4426,"Characteristics, sources and health risk assessment of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities: A review Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds composed of at least two benzene rings. This paper reviews the characteristics, sources and health risk of airborne particulate PAHs in Chinese cities. The airborne particulate PAH concentrations varied from 3.35 to 910ngm-3, with an average of 75.0ngm-3, and the pollution level of PAHs in northern cities was generally higher than that in southern cities. The PAH concentrations in different cities underwent similar seasonal variations, with high concentrations in the winter and relatively low concentrations in the summer. Many factors, such as meteorological conditions and source emissions, influenced the spatiotemporal pattern of PAHs. High temperatures, frequent flow exchanges, abundant rainfall and strong solar radiation reduced the level of particulate PAHs in the atmosphere. The historical changes in the level of airborne particulate PAHs in four cities were analyzed. The PAH concentrations in Beijing and Taiyuan presented a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, while the level of particulate PAHs in Nanjing and Guangzhou had a decreasing tendency from year 2000-2015. The airborne particulate PAHs in cities were derived from several sources, including coal combustion, vehicle emissions, coking industries, biomass burning and petroleum volatilization. The results of a health risk assessment indicated that the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for people in the northern cities was higher than that for people in the other regions, especially during the cold season. Moreover, adults were at greater risk than people in other age groups, and the health risk to females was slightly higher than that to males. The potential risk of airborne particulate PAH exposure was relatively high in some cities, and controlling PAH emissions at the source should be required to prevent pollution.

3732,"Dynamic in vivo profiling of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy using canine patients as a model Time resolved data of DNA damage and repair after radiotherapy elucidates the relation between damage, repair, and cell survival. While well characterized in vitro, little is known about the time-course of DNA damage response in tumors sampled from individual patients. Kinetics of DNA damage after radiotherapy was assessed in eight dogs using repeated in vivo samples of tumor and co-irradiated normal tissue analyzed with comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) immunohistochemistry. In vivo results were then compared (in silico) with a dynamic mathematical model for DNA damage formation and repair. Maximum %DNA in tail was observed at 15-60 min after irradiation, with a rapid decrease. Time-courses of gammaH2AX-foci paralleled these findings with a small time delay and were not influenced by covariates. The evolutionary parameter search based on %DNA in tail revealed a good fit of the DNA repair model to in vivo data for pooled sarcoma time-courses, but fits for individual sarcoma time-courses suffer from the heterogeneous nature of the in vivo data. It was possible to follow dynamics of comet tail intensity and gammaH2AX-foci during a course of radiation using a minimally invasive approach. DNA repair can be quantitatively investigated as time-courses of individual patients by integrating this resulting data into a dynamic mathematical model.Copyright © 2017 by the authors.

Method(s): Patients radiographically defined with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer were eligible. A preoperative, short-course, dose-escalation study was performed with fixed 8 fractions in 2 weeks. The dose of irradiation was increased by 5% increments from 30 grays equivalents (GyE) to 36.8 GyE. Surgery was to be performed 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of CIRT. Result(s): The study enrolled 26 patients. At the time of restaging after CIRT, disease progression with distant metastasis or refusal ruled out 5 patients from surgery. Twenty-one of 26 patients (81%) patients underwent surgery. The pattern of initial disease progression was distant metastasis in 17 patients (65%) and regional recurrence in 2 patients (8%). No patients experienced local recurrence. The 5-year survival rates for all 26 patients and for those who underwent surgery were 42% and 52%, respectively.

Method(s): The study was designed to include a sample of 35 000 people divided between 40 clusters. The clusters were selected by sampling proportional to population size. In each cluster, census data were obtained from eligible individuals. Individuals aged 15 years or more were questioned about cough and its duration and smoking and were asked to provide two samples of sputum (spot and morning) for examination by fluorescence microscopy. Finding(s): A total of 38 032 individuals were included in the study. Of the 19 197 individuals aged 15 years or more, 18 152 (94.6%) provided at least one sample of sputum. Fifteen individuals fulfilled the case definition, providing a prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis of 90 per 100 000 (95% confidence interval, CI, 35-145 per 100 000) individuals aged 15 years or more and 50 per 100 000 (95% CI, 19-80 per 100 000) in the total population. Conclusion(s): The estimated prevalence of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis obtained from our study is considerably lower than the estimate published by the World Health Organization.

Background and purpose To evaluate the outcome of malignant salivary gland tumours treated with neutron therapy to assess the potential for other high linear energy transfer (LET) beams. Materials and methods Neutrons at iThemba LABS are produced by the reaction of 66 MeV protons on a beryllium target. A median dose 20.4 Gy, in 12 fractions in 4 weeks or 15 fractions in 5 weeks, was given to 335 patients with 176 irresectable, 104 macroscopically residual and 55 unresected tumours. Results Locoregional control was 60.6% at 5 years and 39.1% at 10 years and DSS was 66.8% and 53.7% at 5 and 10 years respectively. In the univariate analysis T4, >4 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma, unresected and irresectable tumours, and positive nodes were significantly worse for LRC. In the multivariate analysis tumours >6 cm, squamous carcinoma, irresectable tumours and nodes were significantly worse for LRC. Tumours >6 cm, high grade, squamous carcinoma and nodes were significantly worse for DSS. Neither LRC nor DSS was influenced by age, sex, site, dose, fractionation or for initial or recurrent disease. Conclusions Neutron therapy appears to be the treatment of choice for macroscopically incompletely excised and irresectable salivary gland tumours with improved survival rates.

3857,"Clinical criteria for obtaining maxillofacial computed tomographic scans in trauma patients BACKGROUND: Over 150,000 patients present with maxillofacial trauma annually to emergency rooms in the United States. Although maxillofacial computed tomography is a sensitive screening tool for identifying facial fractures, indiscriminate use leads to unnecessary radiation exposure and substantial costs. A decision instrument is needed to ensure computed tomographic evaluation of patients at high risk for facial fracture and limit computed tomography use in low-risk patients., METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients evaluated at a Level I trauma center over a 3-year period. Inclusion criteria were maxillofacial examination on presentation, maxillofacial computed tomography, and head computed tomography. A total of 525 patients met the enrollment criteria., RESULTS: Injury to the maxillofacial skeleton occurred in 332 patients (63.2 percent). The presence of any of the following five physical examination criteria identified patients at high risk for facial fracture: bony stepoff or instability, periorbital swelling or contusion, Glasgow Coma Scale score less than 14, malocclusion, or tooth absence. These criteria identified all but six of the 332 patients with a facial fracture (sensitivity, 98.2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 96.5 to 99.1 percent). The negative predictive value was 87.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 76.3 to 94.2 percent). No patient determined by these criteria to be at low risk for a facial fracture required surgical treatment. If these criteria had been applied to the study population, radiographic imaging could have been avoided in 9.3 percent of patients., CONCLUSIONS: A decision instrument based on clinical criteria can ensure appropriate screening of patients at high risk for facial fracture. Application of this instrument may reduce unnecessary maxillofacial imaging.",Excluded
3575,"Retinal injury by neodymium: YAG laser BACKGROUND: More than 83 cases of retinal laser injury were reported in the literature. Most of these cases involved direct exposure of the patient's retina to laser. The authors observed two patients who had laser injury to the retina caused by the reflected beams from a pulsed neodymium: YAG (Nd:YAG) laser., METHODS: The clinical course of each patient after laser injury to the macular area with an Nd:YAG laser were followed for 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 months., RESULTS: Both patients were graduate students and were injured by the reflected beams of short-pulsed Nd:YAG lasers (1064 nm). The affected eyes showed similar clinical courses with early subretinal/retinal/vitreous hemorrhage, resorption of blood, and subsequent macular pucker and macular hole formation, although the students' visual acuity improved. The unaffected eye of patient #2 showed chorioretinal scars, possibly from a previously unreported laser injury., CONCLUSION: The clinical courses of these two cases resembled earlier reported ones showing hemorrhage and subsequent macular pucker and macular hole formation. The two cases reflect the need for closer examination of the standard procedures in laser handling.

4091,"Site-specific cancer incidence and mortality after cerebral angiography with radioactive thorotrast Few opportunities exist to evaluate the carcinogenic effects of long-term internal exposure to alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides. Patients injected with Thorotrast (thorium-232) during radiographic procedures, beginning in the 1930s, provide one such valuable opportunity. We evaluated site-specific cancer incidence and mortality among an international cohort of 3,042 patients injected during cerebral angiography with either Thorotrast (n = 1,650) or a nonradioactive agent (n = 1,392) and who survived 2 or more years. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) for Thorotrast and comparison patients (Denmark and Sweden) were estimated and relative risks (RR), adjusted for population, age and sex, were generated with multivariate statistical modeling. For U.S. patients, comparable procedures were used to estimate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and RR, representing the first evaluation of long-term, site-specific cancer mortality in this group. Compared with nonexposed patients, significantly increased risks in Thorotrast patients were observed for all incident cancers combined (RR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.9-4.1, n = 480, Denmark and Sweden) and for cancer mortality (RR = 4.0, 95% CI 2.5-6.7, n = 114, U.S.). Approximately 335 incident cancers were above expectation, with large excesses seen for cancers of the liver, bile ducts and gallbladder (55% or 185 excess cancers) and leukemias other than CLL (8% or 26 excess cancers). The RR of all incident cancers increased with time since angiography (P < 0.001) and was threefold at 40 or more years; significant excesses (SIR = 4.0) persisted for 50 years. Increasing cumulative dose of radiation was associated with an increasing risk of all incident cancers taken together and with cancers of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum and other digestive sites; similar findings were observed for U.S. cancer mortality. A marginally significant dose response was observed for the incidence of pancreas cancer (P = 0.05) but not for lung cancer. Our study confirms the relationship between Thorotrast and increased cancer incidence at sites of Thorotrast deposition and suggests a possible association with pancreas cancer. After injection with >20 ml Thorotrast, the cumulative excess risk of cancer incidence remained elevated for up to 50 years and approached 97%. Caution is needed in interpreting the excess risks observed for site-specific cancers, however, because of the potential bias associated with the selection of cohort participants, noncomparability with respect to the internal or external comparison groups, and confounding by indication. Nonetheless, the substantial risks associated with liver cancer and leukemia indicate that unique and prolonged exposure to alpha-particle-emitting Thorotrast increased carcinogenic risks.",Excluded
4528,"Screening for lung cancer using sub-millisievert chest cT with iterative reconstruction algorithm: Image quality and nodule detectability Objective: To investigate the image quality and nodules detectability using ultra-low dose (ULD) protocol with iterative model reconstruction (IMR) algorithm when compared to routine low dose (LD) chest CT in lung cancer screening. methods: Chest CT scans were acquired using a 256-slice scanner for 300 subjects. The scan protocol for the ULD group was 120 kVp/17 mAs while for the LD group was 120 kVp/30 mAs. All images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), hybrid iterative reconstruction (HIR) and IMR algorithms. Effective dose was recorded. Image quality assessments were performed by two radiologists. SD of CT attenuation was measured as objective image noise. The number of non-calcified nodules detected in both groups with different reconstruction algorithms were calculated and compared. Result(s): The effective dose of ULD group (0.67 +/- 0.08mSv) was about 44% reduced compared with LD group (1.20 +/- 0.08mSv) (p < 0.01). IMR improved image quality and reduced image noise significantly than HIR and FBP in both groups (all, p < 0.01). IMR enabled a higher number of nodule detected compared to FBP and HIR in both LD and ULD groups, especially for solid nodules less than 4mm. conclusion: IMR may improve the diagnostic accuracy of ULD CT lung screening with potential nodule detectability improvement. advances in knowledge: IMR enables significant reduction of the image noise and improvement of image quality in sub-mSv (66% reduction) chest scans.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

4079,"Radiation exposure to relatives of patients treated with iodine-131 for thyroid cancer at Siriraj hospital Objective: Thyroid cancer patients treated with I-131 are potential source of radiation exposure to relatives who are knowingly and willingly exposed to ionizing radiation as a result of providing comfort to patients undergoing I-131 therapy. This study aims to determine radiation dose received by relatives who care for non self-supporting I-131 patients at Siriraj Hospital. Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty caregivers of 20 patients underwent I-131 therapy for thyroid cancer with a standard protocol were given specific instructions with regard to radiation safety and provided with electronic digital dosimeter to continuously measure radiation dose received on daily basis, three days in the hospital. On the day patient is released, thyroid uptake estimates were performed to assess internal radiation dose received by caregivers. Result(s): The 3-day accumulative doses to caregivers to patients receiving 150 mCi (n = 11) and 200 mCi (n = 9) of I-131 ranged from 37 to 333 muSv and 176 to 1,920 muSv respectively depending on the level of supports required. Thyroid uptake estimates in all caregivers were undetectable. Dosimeter indicated a maximum whole-body dose of 1.92 mSv was more than the public dose limit of 1 mSv but within the dose constraint of 5 mSv for caregivers. Discussion(s): Radiation dose to caregivers of a non self-supporting hospitalized patient undergoing I-131 therapy were well below the limits recommended by the ICRP. The patients can be comforted with confidence that dose to caregivers will be less than the limit. Conclusion(s): This study provides guidance for medical practitioners to obtain practical radiation safety concerns associated with hospitalized patients receiving I-131 therapy especially when patient needs assistance.Copyright © 2016, Medical Association of Thailand.

4311,"[Organ distribution of ruthenocenyl biogenic amine derivatives--radiodiagnostic agents for the adrenals and ovaries?] The organ distribution of 103Ru labelled ruthenocenyl derivatives of tyramine, histamine, benzylamine, phenylethylamine and homoveratrylamine were measured in rats. The derivatives of tyramine, histamine and benzylamine showed a high affinity for the adrenal and ovar. Adrenal/muscle ratios up to 2000:1 were gained but only if the dose was administered i.v. and was below 0.1 mumol/kg. The ruthenocenyl derivatives of tyramine labelled with 103Ru in the ruthenocene moiety or with 14C in the tyramine moiety showed a parallel distribution pattern but completely different from the distribution of 103RuCl3. This indicates that the tyramine derivatives are not destroyed in the body yielding Ru-ions. The advantages of the ruthenocenyl derivatives in comparison with the known amphetamine derivatives labelled with radioactive iodine are discussed.",Excluded
4470,"Long-term outcomes of combined endoscopic resection and chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with submucosal invasion Background: For esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with submucosal (SM) invasion, surgery is the standard treatment. Definitive chemoradiotherapy (D-CRT) is a less invasive alternative option, but sometimes results in locoregional failure. Aim(s): To examine whether endoscopic resection for primary lesion removal combined with chemoradiotherapy (ER-CRT) reduces locoregional failure rates in cases of ESCC with SM invasion. Method(s): We retrospectively compared clinical outcomes between ER-CRT and D-CRT in patients diagnosed with ESCC with SM invasion between 2003 and 2014. Twenty-one patients underwent ER-CRT based on a pathological diagnosis, and 43 patients underwent D-CRT based on a clinical diagnosis. Result(s): Locoregional failure developed in 26% of patients in the D-CRT group, and in no patients in the ER-CRT group (p < 0.01). Thus, the 5-year relapse-free survival in the ER-CRT group was significantly more favorable than that in the D-CRT group (85.1% vs 59.2%; p < 0.05), although there was no difference in overall survival (85.1% vs 79.1%) nor in cause-specific survival (90.5% vs 87.2%) between the groups. There were no instances of perforation or hemorrhage associated with ER. Conclusion(s): ER-CRT is a safe and effective treatment strategy and can be considered as a new minimally invasive treatment option for patients with ESCC with SM invasion.Copyright © 2018 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.",Excluded
3809,"NRF2 mutation confers malignant potential and resistance to chemoradiation therapy in advanced esophageal squamous cancer Esophageal squamous cancer (ESC) is one of the most aggressive tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) has improved the clinical outcome, but the molecular background determining the effectiveness of therapy remains unknown. NRF2 is a master transcriptional regulator of stress adaptation, and gain of-function mutation of NRF2 in cancer confers resistance to stressors including anticancer therapy. Direct resequencing analysis revealed that Nrf2 gain-of-function mutation occurred recurrently (18/82, 22%) in advanced ESC tumors and ESC cell lines (3/10). The presence of Nrf2 mutation was associated with tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Short hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of NRF2 in ESC cells that harbor only mutated Nrf2 allele revealed that themutant NRF2 conferred increased cell proliferation, attachment-independent survival, and resistance to 5-fluorouracil and gamma-irradiation. Based on the Nrf2 mutation status, gene expression signatures associated with NRF2 mutation were extracted from ESC cell lines, and their potential utility for monitoring and prognosis was examined in a cohort of 33 pre-CRT cases of ESC. The molecular signatures of NRF2 mutation were significantly predictive and prognostic for CRT response. In conclusion, recurrent NRF2 mutation confers malignant potential and resistance to therapy in advanced ESC, resulting in a poorer outcome. Molecular signatures of NRF2 mutation can be applied as predictive markers of response to CRT, and efficient inhibition of aberrant NRF2 activation could be a promising approach in combination with CRT.",Excluded
4559,"Hypofraction radiotherapy of liver tumor using cone beam computed tomography guidance combined with active breath control by long breath-holding BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and validity of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and active breath control (ABC) by long breath-holding in hypofraction radiotherapy of liver tumor., METHODS AND MATERIALS: Twenty-four patients received hypofraction radiotherapy of liver tumor with long breath-holding at end-inhale; four prescriptions were used: 6 Gyx7 (n=8), 10 Gyx4 (n=7), 5 Gyx9 (n=6), 4 Gyx10 (n=3). For each fraction, all patients received pre-correction CBCT scans with ABC, some patients received post-correction and post-treatment CBCT. The interfraction and intrafraction liver positioning errors on medial-lateral (ML), cranial-caudal (CC) and anterior-posterior (AP) directions were obtained. The theoretic margin from clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) was calculated based on post-treatment error. The dosimetric parameters of PTV and normal tissue were compared between ABC and free breathing (FB)., RESULTS: The interfraction error in liver positioning showed system errors (SIGMA) of 3.18 mm (ML), 6.80 mm (CC) and 3.05 mm (AP); random error (sigma) of 3.03 mm (ML), 6.78 mm (CC) and 3.62 mm (AP). These errors were significantly reduced with CBCT guided online correction. The intrafraction systematic error was 0.72 mm (ML), 2.21 mm (CC), 1.49 mm (AP), and random error was 2.30 mm (ML), 3.58 mm (CC), 2.49 mm (AP). Dosimetric parameters such as PTV, the liver's volume included by 23, 30 Gy isodose curve (V23, V30), mean dose to normal liver (MDTNL) and mean dose to cord were significantly larger for FB (P<0.05)., CONCLUSION: Liver radiotherapy with long time breath-holding at end-inhale is an effective method to reduce liver motion, PTV and dose to normal tissue. Interfraction and intrafraction liver positioning errors were substantial. CBCT guided online correction of positioning error is recommended for liver radiotherapy with end-inhale ABC.

4165,"Cardiac valve calcifications on low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography: Inter-observer and inter-examination reliability, agreement and variability Objectives: To determine inter-observer and inter-examination variability for aortic valve calcification (AVC) and mitral valve and annulus calcification (MC) in low-dose unenhanced ungated lung cancer screening chest computed tomography (CT). Method(s): We included 578 lung cancer screening trial participants who were examined by CT twice within 3 months to follow indeterminate pulmonary nodules. On these CTs, AVC and MC were measured in cubic millimetres. One hundred CTs were examined by five observers to determine the inter-observer variability. Reliability was assessed by kappa statistics (kappa) and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). Variability was expressed as the mean difference +/- standard deviation (SD). Result(s): Inter-examination reliability was excellent for AVC (kappa=0.94, ICC=0.96) and MC (kappa=0.95, ICC=0.90). Inter-examination variability was 12.7+/-118.2 mm3 for AVC and 31.5+/-219.2 mm3 for MC. Inter-observer reliability ranged from kappa=0.68 to kappa=0.92 for AVC and from kappa=0.20 to kappa=0.66 for MC. Inter-observer ICC was 0.94 for AVC and ranged from 0.56 to 0.97 for MC. Inter-observer variability ranged from -30.5+/-252.0 mm3 to 84.0+/-240.5 mm3 for AVC and from -95.2+/-210.0 mm3 to 303.7+/-501.6 mm 3 for MC. Conclusion(s): AVC can be quantified with excellent reliability on ungated unenhanced low-dose chest CT, but manual detection of MC can be subject to substantial inter-observer variability. Lung cancer screening CT may be used for detection and quantification of cardiac valve calcifications. Key points: * Low-dose unenhanced ungated chest computed tomography can detect cardiac valve calcifications. * However, calcified cardiac valves are not reported by most radiologists. * Inter-observer and inter-examination variability of aortic valve calcifications is sufficient for longitudinal studies. * Volumetric measurement variability of mitral valve and annulus calcifications is substantial. © 2014 European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
4302,"Effects of Proton Pump Inhibitors on the Small Bowel and Stool Microbiomes Background: Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is extremely common. PPIs have been suggested to affect the gut microbiome, and increase risks of Clostridium difficile infection and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). However, existing data are based on stool analyses and PPIs act on the foregut. Aim(s): To compare the duodenal and stool microbiomes in PPI and non-PPI users. Method(s): Consecutive subjects presenting for upper endoscopy without colonoscopy were recruited. Current antibiotic users were excluded. Subjects taking PPI were age- and gender-matched 1:2 to non-PPI controls. Subjects completed medical history questionnaires, and duodenal aspirates were collected using a validated protected catheter. A subset also provided stool samples. Duodenal and stool microbiomes were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Result(s): The duodenal microbiome exhibited no phylum-level differences between PPI (N = 59) and non-PPI subjects (N = 118), but demonstrated significantly higher relative abundances of families Campylobacteraceae (3.13-fold, FDR P value < 0.01) and Bifidobacteriaceae (2.9-fold, FDR P value < 0.01), and lower relative abundance of Clostridiaceae (88.24-fold, FDR P value < 0.0001), in PPI subjects. SIBO rates were not significantly different between groups, whether defined by culture (> 103 CFU/ml) or 16S sequencing, nor between subjects taking different PPIs. The stool microbiome exhibited significantly higher abundance of family Streptococcaceae (2.14-fold, P = 0.003), and lower Clostridiaceae (2.60-fold, FDR P value = 8.61E-13), in PPI (N = 22) versus non-PPI (N = 47) subjects. Conclusion(s): These findings suggest that PPI use is not associated with higher rates of SIBO. Relative abundance of Clostridiaceae was reduced in both the duodenal and stool microbiomes, and Streptococcaceae was increased in stool.

4439,"Impact of Radiation Dose on Survival for Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Treated With Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Purpose: Radiation dose used in the neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) for patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) varies in different trials and clinical practice. Methods and Materials: Data from patients diagnosed with ESCC receiving NCRT followed by esophagectomy were retrospectively collected from February 2013 to December 2017. Lower dose (LD) radiotherapy was defined as <=45 Gy, and >45 Gy was considered as higher dose (HD). Survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with long-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with survival. Result(s): A total of 118 patients treated with NCRT were included in our analysis: 62 patients received LD radiotherapy, and 56 patients received HD radiotherapy. The median follow-up time was 24.3 months (0.67-65.3 m). Two-years overall survival (OS) rates were 75.0 and 79.0% in HD and LD group, respectively (P = 0.360), and complete pathological remission (pCR) rates in two groups were 42.9 and 30.6%, respectively (P = 0.17). The incidences of toxic effects including post-operative complications were not significantly different between two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor T stage, M1a disease, smoking history, and pCR rate were significantly associated with OS. Conclusion(s): In ESCC patients treated with NCRT followed by surgery, higher radiation dose was not significantly associated with a higher pCR rate and longer survival. Lower radiation dose might be a preferable time-dose fraction scheme. Our finding needs to be further validated by randomized trials.© Copyright © 2020 Yang, Xu, Zhou, Bao, Zhang, Gu, Du, Chen and Qiu.",Excluded
3725,"Third-generation dual-source CT of the neck using automated tube voltage adaptation in combination with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction: evaluation of image quality and radiation dose Purpose: To evaluate image quality and radiation dose in third-generation dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) of the neck using automated tube voltage adaptation (TVA) with advanced modelled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) algorithm. Method(s): One hundred and sixteen patients were retrospectively evaluated. Group A (n = 59) was examined on second-generation DSCT with automated TVA and filtered back projection. Group B (n = 57) was examined on a third-generation DSCT with automated TVA and ADMIRE. Age, body diameter, attenuation of several anatomic structures, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), radiation dose (CTDIvol) and size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) were assessed. Diagnostic acceptability was rated by three readers. Result(s): Age (p = 0.87) and body diameter (p = 0.075) did not differ significantly. Tube voltage in Group A was set automatically to 100 kV for all patients (n = 59), and to 70 kV (n = 2), 80 kV (n = 5), and 90 kV (n = 50) in Group B. Noise was reduced and CNR was increased significantly (p < 0.001). Diagnostic acceptability was rated high in both groups, with better ratings in Group B (p < 0.001). SSDE was reduced by 34 % in Group B (20.38 +/- 1.63 mGy vs. 13.04 +/- 1.50 mGy, p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Combination of automated TVA and ADMIRE in neck CT using third-generation DSCT results in a substantial radiation dose reduction with low noise and increased CNR. Key Points: * Third-generation DSCT provides automated tube voltage adaptation with an increment of 10 kV. * 10 kV increment optimizes scans to the patient's neck anatomy. * TVA combined with ADMIRE significantly lower radiation dose in contrast-enhanced neck CT. * TVA in combination with ADMIRE reduces noise and increases SNR and CNR. * Image analysis quoted less noise and better diagnostic acceptability in third-generation DSCT.Copyright © 2015, European Society of Radiology.",Excluded
3347,"Low dose IR-induced IGF-1-sCLU expression: a p53-repressed expression cascade that interferes with TGFbeta1 signaling to confer a pro-survival bystander effect Inadvertent mammalian tissue exposures to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR) after radiation accidents, remediation of radioactive-contaminated areas, space travel or a dirty bomb represent an interesting trauma to an organism. Possible low-dose IR-induced bystander effects could impact our evaluation of human health effects, as cells within tissue are not equally damaged after doses of IR <=10 cGy. To understand tissue responses after low IR doses, we generated a reporter system using the human clusterin promoter fused to firefly luciferase (hCLUp-Luc). Secretory clusterin (sCLU), an extracellular molecular chaperone, induced by low doses of cytotoxic agents, clears cell debris. Low-dose IR (>=2 cGy) exposure induced hCLUp-Luc activity with peak levels at 96 h, consistent with endogenous sCLU levels. As doses increased (>=1 Gy), sCLU induction amplitudes increased and time-to-peak response decreased. sCLU expression was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1, but suppressed by p53. Responses in transgenic hCLUp-Luc reporter mice after low IR doses showed that specific tissues (that is, colon, spleen, mammary, thymus and bone marrow) of female mice induced hCLUp-Luc activity more than male mice after whole body (>=10 cGy) irradiation. Tissue-specific, non-linear dose- and time-responses of hCLUp-Luc and endogenous sCLU levels were noted. Colon maintained homeostatic balance after 10 cGy. Bone marrow responded with delayed, but prolonged and elevated expression. Intraperitoneal administration of alpha-transforming growth factor (TGF)beta1 (1D11), but not control (13C4) antibodies, immediately following IR exposure abrogated CLU induction responses. Induction in vivo also correlated with Smad signaling by activated TGFbeta1 after IR. Mechanistically, media with elevated sCLU levels suppressed signaling, blocked apoptosis and increased survival of TGFbeta1-exposed tumor or normal cells. Thus, sCLU is a pro-survival bystander factor that abrogates TGFbeta1 signaling and most likely promotes wound healing.",Included
3760,"Radiation-induced lung injury on PET/CT: Analysis of FDG uptake response within specific isodose regions of irradiation in non-small cell lung cancer patients Objective: Inflammatory response associated with radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) results in an increased 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). In this study, we aimed to analyze the degree of FDG uptake within specific isodose regions (IR) of the irradiated lung using standardized uptake value (SUV) measurements, and to correlate posttreatment FDG uptake with radiotherapy (RT) dose parameters, patient characteristics and the imaging time interval after RT completion. Material(s) and Method(s): Data from 30 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent FDG PET/CT imaging at least 12 weeks (72-668 days) after completion of RT were evaluated. In each patient, side-by-side visual registration of the treatment planning CT slices including IR curves with the corresponding PET/CT slices was performed. Using SUV measurements, FDG uptake levels were analyzed within specific IRs of the irradiated lung. The statistical difference between SUVmax of each IR was determined. The RT dose parameters, patient characteristics and time interval between RT and PET/CT were tested for correlation with SUV- max of IRs. Result(s): The mean SUVmax in the IRs of the lung that received 2000-4000cGy was 1.51 +/- 0.66 (mean +/- SD) (min-max: 0.69-2.84), 4000-6000cGy was 2.67 +/- 1.16 (min-max: 0.71-6.0), and >6000Gy was 3.55 +/- 1.09 (min-max: 1.2-5.72). We found statistically significant differences between the SUVmax values of all IRs (SUV2000 vs. SUV4000, p= 0.001; SUV2000 vs.6000, p= 0.002; SUV4000 vs. 6000, p= 0.001). No statistically significant correlation was found between SUVmax and the other variables. Conclusion(s): The findings of this study showed that, although some overlap occurs between IRs, the degree of radiation-related parenchymal FDG uptake gets higher with increasing dose levels. Persistent high FDG uptake levels may be observed in radiation fibrosis areas on PET/CT even several months after RT. © 2011 by Turkiye Klinikleri.",Excluded
3754,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene polymorphism in psoriasis and its relation to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and narrowband ultraviolet B response: A case-control study in Egyptian patients Background: Psoriasis is a common dermatologic disease with multifactorial etiology in which genetic factors play a major role. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma is expressed in keratinocytes and is known to affect cell maturation and differentiation in addition to its role in inflammation. Aim(s): To study the association between PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism and psoriasis vulgaris in Egyptian patients to explore if this polymorphism influenced disease risk or clinical presentation. Method(s): Forty-five patients with psoriasis vulgaris and 45 age, sex and body mass index matched healthy volunteers who have no present, past or family history of psoriasis as a control group were enrolled. Selected cases included obese and nonobese participants. Detection of PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism was done with restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction. Narrow-band ultraviolet B (NBUVB) was given for every case three times/week for 12 weeks. Result(s): Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were significantly associated with cases (P = 0.01, P = 0.01, and P = 0.004, respectively) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis by 5.25, 3.65, and 3.37 folds, respectively. Heteropolymorphism was significantly associated with nonobese cases compared to obese ones (P = 0.01). Ala allele was significantly associated with obese cases (P = 0.001) and increased risk of occurrence of psoriasis in obese participants by 1.14 folds. Homopolymorphism, heteropolymorphism, and Ala allele were more prevalent among obese cases without metabolic syndrome (MS) than obese cases with MS but without statistical significance. Percentage of decrease of mean Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score before and after 3 months of treatment with NBUVB was higher in cases with heteropolymorphism with no significant difference between homo- and heteropolymorphism. Conclusion(s): PPAR-gamma gene polymorphism is associated with and increased the risk of psoriasis and its associated obesity in Egyptian patients. It has no role in NBUVB response in those patients.

4392,"Radiation exposure to staff in intensive care unit with portable CT scanner Background. Bedside radiological procedures pose a risk of radiation exposure to ICU staff. The perception of risk may increase the degree of caution among the health care staff and raise new barriers preventing patients from obtaining prompt care. Objective. The aim of this study was to estimate the annual cumulative radiation dose to individual ICU staff. Methods. In this prospective study, forty subjects were required to wear thermoluminescent dosimeter badges during their working hours. The badges were analyzed to determine the exposure after 3 months. Results. A total of 802 radiological procedures were completed at bedside during the study period. The estimated annual dosage to doctors and nurses on average was 0.99 mSv and 0.88 mSv (p < 0.001), respectively. Residents were subjected to the highest radiation exposure (1.04 mSv per year, p = 0.002). The radiation dose was correlated with day shift working hours (r = 0.426; p = 0.006) and length of service (r = - 0.403; p < 0.01). Conclusions. With standard precautions, bedside radiological procedures - including portable CT scans - do not expose ICU staff to high dose of ionizing radiation.

4447,"Differentiation between recurrent gliomas and radiation necrosis using arterial spin labeling perfusion imaging Arterial spin labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging has been proposed as an effective method to measure brain tumor perfusion. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the utility of this technique in the differentiation of recurrent gliomas from radiation necrosis. Twenty-one patients with surgically treated primary gliomas, including 16 cases of recurrent glioma and 5 of radiation necrosis were examined using 3.0T MR imaging (MRI). ASL and dynamic susceptibility contrast-weighted (DSC) perfusion MRI scans were performed. Maps of normalized cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ASL imaging and cerebral blood volume (CBV) in DSC imaging were computed and analyzed in the regions of interest. In cases of glioma recurrence, the normalized ASL-CBF ratio (4.45+/-2.72) was higher than that in cases of radiation injury (1.22+/-0.61) (P<0.01). The normalized DSC-relative CBV ratio was also significantly higher in glioma recurrence (3.38+/-2.08) than it was in radiation injury (1.09+/-0.55) (P<0.05). A close linear correlation was found between the ASL and DSC MRI techniques (linear regression coefficient, R=0.85; P=0.005) in the differentiation of recurrent glioma from radiation injury. The results indicate that ASL perfusion is an accurate method of distinguishing between glioma recurrence and radiation necrosis.Copyright © 2016, Spandidos Publications.

4238,"Implications for preserving neural stem cells in whole brain radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation: A review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients This study delineated the incidence of metastatic involvement of neural stem cell (NSC) regions and further aimed to explore the feasibility of selectively sparing the NSC compartments during whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). A total of 2270 intracranial metastases in 488 patients were identified. Lesions were classified according to locations, including lesions in the NSC compartments (subventricular zone, SVZ, or hippocampus) and those in the rest of the brain/brainstem. The incidence of involvement of NSC regions was compared between oligometastatic patients (those with 14 lesions) and non-oligometastatic patients (those with 5 or more lesions) using a chi-square test. The volume of the NSC regions accounted for 2.23% of the whole brain, and the overall rate of metastatic lesions in NSC regions was 1.1% in 2270 metastases (25/2270), and 4.7% in 488 patients (23/488). Of the NSC region metastases, 7 (0.3%) involved the hippocampus and 18 (0.8%) occurred in the SVZ. Among the 7 hippocampal metastases identified in this study, 1/7 (14.3%) were found in oligometastatic patients, while 6/7 (85.7%) metastases were in non-oligometastatic patients. For metastases in the SVZ, all lesions occurred in non-oligometastatic patients with none in oligometastatic patients. Metastatic involvement of the NSC compartments was significantly lower in oligometastatic patients (0.15%, 1/670) than in non-oligometastatic patients (1.5%, 24/1600) (P < 0.001). Our retrospective review of 2270 metastases in 488 patients is that the volume of the compartments of NSC regions was 2.23% relative to the whole brain, but the incidence of involvement of the NSC compartments was 1.1%, and the vast majority of NSC lesions were found in nonoligometastatic patients. We believe our data supports selective reduction of doses for these aforementioned structures, when treating oligometastatic patients with WBRT and locally advanced-stage small-cell lung cancer patients with PCI. © The Author 2012.

3875,"Comparative toxicity of synchrotron and conventional radiation therapy based on total and partial body irradiation in a murine model Synchrotron radiation can facilitate novel radiation therapy modalities such as microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) and high dose-rate synchrotron broad-beam radiation therapy (SBBR). Both of these modalities have unique physical properties that could be exploited for an improved therapeutic effect. While pre-clinical studies report promising normal tissue sparing phenomena, systematic toxicity data are still required. Our objective was to characterise the toxicity of SBBR and MRT and to calculate equivalent doses of conventional radiation therapy (CRT). A dose-escalation study was performed on C57BLJ/6 mice using total body and partial body irradiations. Dose-response curves and TD50 values were subsequently calculated using PROBIT analysis. For SBBR at dose-rates of 37 to 41 Gy/s, we found no evidence of a normal tissue sparing effect relative to CRT. Our findings also show that the MRT valley dose, rather than the peak dose, best correlates with CRT doses for acute toxicity. Importantly, longer-term weight tracking of irradiated animals revealed more pronounced growth impairment following MRT compared to both SBBR and CRT. Overall, this study provides the first in vivo dose-equivalence data between MRT, SBBR and CRT and presents systematic toxicity data for a range of organs that can be used as a reference point for future pre-clinical work.",Excluded

Evaluate cognitive function of patients with Wechsler adult intelligence scale-Chinese revised (WAIS-CR). HC were segmented into HC head (HH), HC body (HB) and HC tail (HT) and the indexes were then analyzed. WAIS-CR was tested before and 3months after radiotherapy. The mean radiation dose of left and right HC was (1147+/-976)cGy, (1011+/-602)cGy respectively. The radiation dose and the volume exposed in different dose of HH, HB and HT decreased in turn. For 5 patients, before and after radiotherapy, the regular-order score was 8.60+/-1.34, 8.0+/-1.00 (P=0.43), while the reverse-order score was 5.80+/-0.84, 5.20+/-0.84 (P=0.07).

3978,"Spinal navigation for minimally invasive thoracic and lumbosacral spine fixation: implications for radiation exposure, operative time, and accuracy of pedicle screw placement Purpose: Navigation is emerging as a useful adjunct in percutaneous, minimally invasive spinal surgery (MIS). The aim of this study was to compare C-Arm navigated, O-Arm navigated and conventional 2D-fluoroscopy assisted MIS thoracic and lumbosacral spine fixation techniques in terms of operating time, radiation exposure and accuracy of pedicle screw (PS) placement. Method(s): Retrospective observational study of 152 consecutive adults who underwent MIS fixations for spinal instability: 96 2D-fluoroscopy assisted, 39 3D-C-Arm navigated and 27 using O-Arm navigated. Result(s): O-Arm navigation significantly reduced PS misplacement (1.23%, p) compared to 3D-C-Arm navigation (7.29%, p = 0.0082) and 2D-fluoro guided placement (5.16%, p = 0379). 3D-C-Arm navigation was associated with lower procedural radiation exposure of the patient (0.4 mSv) than O-Arm navigation (3.24 mSv) or 2D-fluoro guidance (1.5 mSv). Operative time was comparable between three modalities. Conclusion(s): O-Arm navigation provides greater accuracy of percutaneous instrumentation placement with an acceptable procedural radiation dose delivered to the patients and comparable operative times.

Those simulation procedures account for more than 80 % of all simulation procedures performed nationwide. Then, total DLP and CTDIvol was calculated and mean, median and 3rd quartile for both units together were presented to determine national DRLs for simulation procedures. The same data was later compared between both units to discover any potential need for optimization., RESULTS: 3rd quartile values of DLP for abdomen, breast, chest, head, head and neck, pelvis and spine were 1116.2, 606.6, 832.4, 1942.4, 969.2, 677.1 and 1042.4 mGy.cm, respectively. 3rd quartile CTDIvol values for the same sequence of procedures were 18.7, 13.3, 19.2, 76.9, 22.6, 17.9 and 22.2mGy, respectively. Among the two units, the mentioned dose values were on average significantly higher on one CT unit than on the other unit., CONCLUSIONS: When comparing collected dose values with other studies, RT CT DRLs showed that radiation doses from our institution were similar or even lower. Some variations were found between both CT units in certain protocols, so exposure parameters should be reviewed and optimized. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4085,"Extreme solar event of AD775: Potential radiation exposure to crews in deep space The existence of a historically large cosmic event in AD774 or 775, of probable solar origin, has recently been confirmed from records of 14C levels in tree rings located at widely separated locations on Earth, 10Be records in polar ice cores, and historical records of aurora sightings. Usoskin et al (Astronomy & Astrophysics, 2013) suggest that such an event, of solar origin, would have a proton fluence of 4.5 1010 cm-2 at energies above 30 MeV, with a hard energy spectrum comparable to the event of 23 February 1956. In this work we investigate the possible radiation exposures to crews of missions on the surface of Mars, from such an event. In this work we use the HZETRN radiation transport code, originally developed at NASA Langley Research Center, and the Computerized Anatomical Male and Female human geometry models to estimate exposures for a variety of aluminum shield areal densities similar to those provided by a spacesuit, surface lander, and permanent habitat on the Martian surface. Comparisons of the predicted organ exposures with recently-recommended radiation exposure limits are made. Potential health effects on crews, of such an event, are also discussed.",Excluded
3465,"Racial Disparities in Lung Cancer Screening: An Exploratory Investigation Background/Purpose: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Black Americans have the highest rate of lung cancer mortality, due to being diagnosed at later stage. Lung Cancer Screening (LCS) facilitates earlier detection and has been associated with a reduction in cancer death. We investigated LCS utilization and explored racial disparities (Black vs. non-Black) in LCS among patients for whom LCS is clinically indicated. Method(s): Using electronic medical records from the Lifespan Medical System, we randomly selected 200 patients who were likely to meet U. S. Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) guidelines for LCS and mailed each patient a survey to assess LCS eligibility and uptake. Result(s): Nearly three-quarters (n = 146, 73%) completed the survey and, of survey respondents, 92% (n = 134) were eligible for the study. Among eligible patients, 35% met criteria for LCS; non-Black patients were 90% more likely to meet criteria for LCS than Black patients (44% vs. 27%). Of the patients meeting USPSTF criteria, only 21% reported being screened; eligible non-Black patients were 2.8 times more likely to have had LCS than eligible Black patients (30% vs. 12%). Conclusion(s): LCS utilization is low despite coverage provided through the Affordable Care Act. Black patients are less likely to qualify for screening and disproportionately less likely to be screened for lung cancer compared with non-Black patients. Targeted intervention strategies are needed to increase referral for and uptake of LCS in patients who are at high risk for developing lung cancer, and for Black patients in particular.Copyright © 2017 National Medical Association",Excluded
4061,"Efficacy of extracranial stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) added to standard treatment in patients with solid tumors (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases: study protocol for a randomised phase III trial (STEREO-OS) BACKGROUND: Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is an innovative modality based on high precision planning and delivery. Cancer with bone metastases and oligometastases are associated with an intermediate or good prognosis. We assume that prolonged survival rates would be achieved if both the primary tumor and metastases are controlled by local treatment. Our purpose is to demonstrate, via a multicenter randomized phase III trial, that local treatment of metastatic sites with curative intent with SBRT associated of systemic standard of care treatment would improve the progression-free survival in patients with solid tumor (breast, prostate and non-small cell lung cancer) with up to 3 bone-only metastases compared to patients who received systemic standard of care treatment alone., METHODS: This is an open-labeled randomized superiority multicenter phase III trial. Patients with up to 3 bone-only metastases will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.between Arm A (Experimental group): Standard care of treatment & SBRT to all bone metastases, and Arm B (Control group): standard care of treatment. For patients receiving SBRT, radiotherapy dose and fractionation depends on the site of the bone metastasis and the proximity to critical normal structures. This study aims to accrue a total of 196 patients within 4 years. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 1 year, and secondary endpoints include Bone progression-free survival; Local control; Cancer-specific survival; Overall survival; Toxicity; Quality of life; Pain score analysis, Cost-utility analysis; Cost-effectiveness analysis and Budget impact analysis., DISCUSSION: The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is a longer expectancy of life without skeletal recurrence and the discomfort, pain and drastic reduction of mobility and handicap that the lack of local control of bone metastases eventually inflicts., TRIALS REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03143322 Registered on May 8th 2017.

4406,"Patients Treated with Preoperative Chemoradiation for Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma have Impaired Bone Density, a Predictor of Distant Metastasis Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a lethal neoplasm that spreads to surrounding tissue or distant sites. This study investigated distant metastases in PDAC patients with or without preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT), focusing on vitamin D levels and bone density. Method(s): This study included 146 patients with PDAC who underwent surgery from 2007 to 2014. Bone density was evaluated using computed tomography, and the preoperative vitamin D level was calculated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for patients with available plasma (48 cases). Result(s): When the patients were divided into two groups according to the change in bone density, the group with decreased bone density had a shorter distant metastasis-free survival time (DMFS) after surgery than the other group (p < 0.05). Low vitamin D was a weak predictor of DMFS, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08), perhaps because of the sample size. Multivariate analysis indicated three significant factors associated with distant metastasis: a decrease in bone density (hazard ratio [HR], 2.17; p = 0.04), normalization of the Dupan-2 value after surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; p = 0.02), and completion of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.29; p < 0.01). Univariate analysis showed that a low vitamin D concentration (<20 pg/ml) was a risk factor (p = 0.04) for bone density change. Multivariate analysis found that preoperative CRT was the only factor associated (+/-, OR, 5.8; p = 0.04) with bone density change, suggesting that preoperative CRT significantly decreases bone density in patients with insufficient vitamin D. Conclusion(s): Patients treated with preoperative CRT tend to have impaired bone density, which is a predictor of distant metastasis. Thus, vitamin D supplementation may decrease distant metastasis.Copyright © 2017, Society of Surgical Oncology.",Excluded
3653,"Localized sinonasal mucosal melanoma: Outcomes and associations with stage, radiotherapy, and positron emission tomography response Background: Sinonasal mucosal melanoma is a rare neoplasm with a poor prognosis. Method(s): Retrospective analysis was conducted on 78 patients with localized sinonasal mucosal melanoma treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC from 1998-2013). Demographic, tumor, imaging, and treatment factors were recorded and survival and disease-control outcomes were analyzed. Result(s): Median overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were 32 and 50 months, respectively. Median locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) were 43 and 12 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated greater OS in nasal cavity tumors and earlier T classification. Radiotherapy (RT) was associated with significantly greater LRFS (5-years; 35% vs 59%; p =.01), but no difference in OS. Post-RT positron emission tomography (PET) response was associated with greater OS. Conclusion(s): Distant metastasis is the predominant mode of recurrence in sinonasal mucosal melanoma, but local recurrence remains common. RT is associated with improved local control, but no survival benefit. The prognostic value of post-RT PET imaging warrants further investigation. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

3520,"Advanced multimodal nanoparticles delay tumor progression with clinical radiation therapy Radiation therapy is a major treatment regimen for more than 50% of cancer patients. The collateral damage induced on healthy tissues during radiation and the minimal therapeutic effect on the organ-of-interest (target) is a major clinical concern. Ultra-small, renal clearable, silica based gadolinium chelated nanoparticles (SiGdNP) provide simultaneous MR contrast and radiation dose enhancement. The high atomic number of gadolinium provides a large photoelectric cross-section for increased photon interaction, even for high-energy clinical radiation beams. Imaging and therapy functionality of SiGdNP were tested in cynomolgus monkeys and pancreatic tumor-bearing mice models, respectively. A significant improvement in tumor cell damage (double strand DNA breaks), growth suppression, and overall survival under clinical radiation therapy conditions were observed in a human pancreatic xenograft model. For the first time, safe systemic administration and systematic renal clearance was demonstrated in both tested species. These findings strongly support the translational potential of SiGdNP for MR-guided radiation therapy in cancer treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded

This was a prospective study of 40 adult patients who underwent NECT-KUB for investigation of ureteric colic. Images were reconstructed using FBP, SIR, and MBIR techniques and individually and randomly assessed by two blinded radiologists. Parameters measured were overall image quality, presence of ureteric calculus, presence of hydronephrosis or hydroureters, image quality of each ureteric segment, total length of ureters unable to be visualized, attenuation values of image noise, and retroperitoneal fat content for each patient. There were no diagnostic discrepancies between image reconstruction modalities for urolithiasis. Overall image qualities and for each ureteric segment were superior using MBIR (67.5 % rated as 'Good to Excellent' vs. 25 % in SIR and 2.5 % in FBP). The lengths of non-visualized ureteric segments were shortest using MBIR (55.0 % measured 'less than 5 cm' vs. ASIR 33.8 % and FBP 10 %). MBIR was able to reduce overall image noise by up to 49.36 % over SIR and 71.02 % over FBP.

Method(s): Fifty-one patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx were included in this prospective study. The patients were treated with 3 courses of cisplatin (100 mg at 1 treatment, intra-arterial) and sodium thiosulfate (28 g at 1 treatment, intravenous) once every 2 weeks during concurrent radiotherapy (66 to 70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction, daily for 5 days over 7 weeks). Nodal metastases larger than 3 cm in diameter were treated with an additional 50 mg of cisplatin. The patients with less than 50% tumor reduction after 40 Gy and 2 courses of chemotherapy were treated with surgery. Result(s): The protocol was completed for 49 patients. All living patients had a minimum follow-up period of 2 years. Including the 3 patients with salvage surgery, local disease-free control was achieved in 39 patients (80%). For 36 patients (73.5%), disease-free primary organs were preserved at 2 years after treatment. Locoregional disease-free control for 2 years was obtained for 38 patients (77.6%), in 30 of them without salvage surgery. The patients treated with surgery had an overall survival rate similar to that of the patients with a complete response (80% and 84.6%, respectively).

3663,"The risk of level IB nodal involvement in oropharynx cancer: Guidance for submandibular gland sparing irradiation Purpose Xerostomia remains a common side effect of head and neck irradiation. Conflicting data exist regarding the likelihood of level IB involvement for patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC), and data are limited on this risk in patients with human papillomavirus-positive disease. This study examined surgically treated OPSCC to determine the risk of pathologic level IB nodal involvement and to identify a cohort of patients in whom ipsilateral level IB radiation therapy may be safely omitted. Methods and materials A total of 102 submandibular nodal dissections were identified (92 ipsilateral and 10 contralateral) in 92 patients from 2010 to 2016 in those undergoing primary surgical treatment and dissection of ipsilateral level IB lymph nodes. Radiographically positive cases were excluded. Retrospective chart review was used for data collection, and the rate of pathologic level IB involvement was determined. Results The ipsilateral level IB nodal station had negative imaging and pathologically positive nodes at rates of 4.3% in OPSCC and 5.3% in human papillomavirus-positive OPSCC. Positive node burden in the ipsilateral neck at stations other than IB appeared to correlate with the risk of pathologic positive IB (pIB+) nodes: 50% of pathologically IB-negative patients had 2 or more positive nodes versus 75% of pIB+ patients who had 4 or more positive nodes. Conclusions Our data indicate a low risk of pathologic level IB involvement in early-stage OPSCC. High positive node burden in stations near level IB may be associated with a higher chance of pathologic level IB involvement.Copyright © 2017 American Society for Radiation Oncology",Excluded

In the Ames test for mutagenicity, 2-F-A-85380 was without effect in five bacterial strains. No evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes occurred in either 2-day acute (0.4-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) or 14-day expanded acute (40-4000 nmol/kg i.v.) toxicity studies in mice. Similarly, hematology and serum chemistry values in rhesus monkeys administered 60 nmol/kg i.v. were not affected over 14 days. Like nicotine, 2-F-A-85380 produced convulsions in mice at very high doses. The ED(50) value of 2-F-A-85380 for eliciting tonic-clonic convulsions (5.0 micromol/kg i.v.) was nearly 4 times greater than that of nicotine (ED(50) = 1.4 micromol/kg i.v.). Lower doses of 2-F-A-85380 (30-300 nmol/kg i.v.) and nicotine (20-400 nmol/kg i.v.) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility in rats. Notably, the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the rat electrocardiogram were unaffected by either drug. Dosimetry studies indicated that the urinary bladder wall was the critical organ and total radiation exposure was within acceptable limits. Estimated doses of 2-F-A-85380 required to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% ranged from 40 to 58 nmol/kg i.v. Nevertheless, the estimated radiopharmaceutically relevant dose of [(18)F]2-F-A-8380 required for initial PET imaging studies, 10 pmol/kg, is less than 1/4000th of the doses calculated (40-58 nmol/kg i.v.) to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% in humans and should elicit no clinically significant effects and have acceptable dosimetry.",Excluded
4050,"Biological dosimetry using the micronucleus assay for lymphocytes: interindividual differences in dose response The dose response of the number of micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked lymphocytes after in-vitro irradiation of whole blood with x rays in the dose range 0-4 Gy was studied for a heterogeneous population of 10 donors. One thousand binucleated cells were systematically scored for micronuclei. A linear-quadratic dose dependency of the micronucleus yields was observed. The data were used to derive the accuracy of the dose assessment with the technique in case of a radiation accident. It was shown that for doses of 2 Gy and higher, the uncertainty of the dose was predominantly due to interindividual differences in the x-ray-induced micronucleus yields. At the 95% confidence level, doses lower than 0.3 Gy could not be unequivocally detected with the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay due to the variability of the baseline micronucleus frequency within the donor population and the poor statistical accuracy when scoring 1,000 cells. The precision and sensitivity of the method in the low-dose range could be improved by the knowledge of individual pre-irradiation baseline values and an increase of the number of cells scored by automation of the technique.",Excluded
4139,"Treatment of postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia with the gamma knife Object. Postherpetic neuralgia is a syndrome characterized by intractable pain. Treatment of this pain has not yet been successful. Patients with postherpetic neuralgia will therefore benefit from any progress in the treatment strategy. The authors performed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) as a noninvasive treatment for postherpetic trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and evaluated the success rate for pain relief. Methods. Between 1995 and February 1999, six men and 10 women were treated for postherpetic TN; conservative treatment failed in all of them. The median follow up was 33 months (range 8-34 months). The radiation was focused on the root of the trigeminal nerve in the vicinity of the brainstem (maximal dose 70-80 Gy in one fraction, 4-mm collimator). The patients were divided into five groups according to degree of pain relief after treatment. A successful result (excellent, very good, and good) was reached in seven (44%) patients and radiosurgery failed in nine (56%). Pain relief occurred after a median interval of 1 month (range 10 days-6 months). No radiation-related side effects have been observed in these patients. Conclusions. These results suggest that GKS for postherpetic TN is a relatively successful and safe method that can be used in patients even if they are in poor condition.

3956,"Fluselenamyl: Evaluation of radiation dosimetry in mice and pharmacokinetics in brains of non-human primate Introduction: To allow quantitative assessment of therapeutic efficacy for therapeutic interventions (either approved or undergoing FDA approvals) for either inhibiting or reducing development of Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, 18F-labelled tracers, such as Florbetapir, Florbetaben, and Flutemetamol have been approved. Previously, we have reported on development and preclinical validation of 18F-Fluselenamyl, comprising traits of translatable Abeta imaging agents. Herein, we report the dosimetry data for 18F-Fluselenamyl to provide radiation dose deposited within organs and determine effective dose (ED) for human studies, while also evaluating its pharmacokinetics in the nonhuman primate brains. Method(s): To evaluate safety profiles of 18F-Fluselenamyl for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging agent for monitoring Abeta pathophysiology in vivo, we estimated the human radiation dosimetry extrapolated from rodent biodistribution data obtained by standard method of organ dissection. Animal biodistribution studies were performed in FVB/NCR mice (20 males, 20 females), following tail-vein injection of the tracer. Following euthanasia of mice, organs were harvested, counted, radiation dose to each organ and whole body was determined using the standard MIRD methodology. For evaluation of pharmacokinetics in non-human primates, following intravenous injection of the tracer, dynamic PET scan of rhesus monkey brains were performed, and co-registered with MR for anatomical reference. Parametric images of tracer transport rate constant and distribution volume relative to cerebellum were generated using a simplified reference tissue model and a spatially-constraint linear regression algorithm. Result(s): The critical organ in humans has been determined to be the gall bladder with a gender average radiation absorbed dose of 0.079 mGy/MBq with an effective dose of 0.017 mSv/MBq and 0.020 mSv/MBq, in males and females, respectively. Therefore, these data provide preliminary projections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates, thereby defining safe imaging conditions for further validations in human subjects. Additionally, the tracer penetrated the non-human primate brain and excreted to background levels at later-time points thus pointing to the potential for high signal/noise ratios during noninvasive imaging. Tissue time activity curves (TACs) also show fast initial uptake with maximum projection of activity at 2-6 min post administration followed by clearance of activity at later time-points from cortex, cerebellum, and white matter of nonhuman primate brain. Parametric images confirmed that the 18F-Fluselenamyl has relative high transport rate constant at striatum, thalamus, and cortex. Conclusion(s): The data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in mice indicate that 18F-Fluselenamyl can be safely used for further evaluation in humans. Additionally, 18F-Fluselenamyl demonstrated ability to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB) and indicated high initial influx, followed by clearance to background levels in non-human primate brains. Combined information indicates that 18F-Fluselenamyl would be a potential candidate for detecting amyloid plaques in the living human brain.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3716,"Assessment of Treatment Response by 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT: A Pilot Study in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer Background We investigated the role of 99mTc-MIP-1404 (Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc, New York, NY) SPECT/CT of PSMA expression in the assessment of treatment response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT scans from 28 patients with metastatic prostate cancer examined before initiation and after completion of therapy. Eight of these patients had been treated with androgen deprivation therapy, 10 with docetaxel, and another 10 with external beam radiotherapy. On the CT images from SPECT/CT, treatment response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; independently from that analysis, maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were quantified in representative tumor lesions and treatment response assumed at differences in SUVmax greater than 30%. Radiographic response assessment was correlated to biochemical response (BR) based on prostate-specific antigen serum levels. Results The concordance rate between SPECT and BR was 75% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-0.89) (Cohen kappa = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.29-0.85; P <= 0.01), higher than for that between SPECT and CT with 57% (95% CI, 0.37-0.76) (kappa = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-0.65; P <= 0.01), as well as that between CT and BR with 50% (95% CI, 0.31-0.69) (kappa = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.06-0.57, P <= 0.05). Discordant findings between SPECT and CT were most likely due to limitations of CT in assessing metastases in lymph nodes, as well as bone involvement, which was sometimes not detectable on CT scans. Conclusions The high agreement between treatment response, as assessed by 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT and BR, suggests a possible role of that imaging tool for monitoring treatment in metastatic prostate cancer. Larger, ideally prospective trials are needed to help to reveal the full potential of SPECT imaging of PSMA expression in that regard.Copyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Excluded

This study compares the transbronchial route with augmented fluoroscopic bronchoscopy (AFB) and conventional transthoracic CT-guided methods for preoperative dye localization in thoracoscopic surgery., METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2019, a total of 231 patients with small pulmonary lesions who received preoperative dye localization via AFB or percutaneous CT-guided technique were enrolled in the study. A propensity-matched analysis, incorporating preoperative variables, was used to compare localization and surgical outcomes between the two groups., RESULTS: After matching, a total of 90 patients in the AFB group (N = 30) and CT-guided group (N = 60) were selected for analysis. No significant difference was noted in the demographic data between both the groups. Dye localization was successfully performed in 29 patients (96.7%) and 57 patients (95%) with AFB and CT-guided method, respectively.

No major procedure-related complications occurred in either group; however, a higher rate of pneumothorax (0 vs. 16.7%, p = 0.029) and focal intrapulmonary hemorrhage (3.3 vs. 26.7%, p = 0.008) was noted in the CT-guided group., CONCLUSION: AFB dye marking is an effective alternative for the preoperative localization of small pulmonary lesions, with a lower risk of procedure-related complications than the conventional CT-guided method.",Excluded
3678,"Hemostatic radiation therapy for malignant tumorsda retrospective analysis of bleeding resolution rate Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate if hemostatic radiation therapy was effective in resolving the bleeding and to analyze the factors associated with treatment success. Materials/Methods: Records from patients treated with hemostatic radiation therapy between May 2012 and May 2014 in a single institution were reviewed. The endpoints analyzed were: initial bleeding control rate, re-bleeding incidence and final bleeding control (after salvage treatment of initial treatment failures or re-bleeding). Biological equivalent dose (BED) was categorized (<30 Gy10 vs >/Z 30 Gy10). The statistics were done using Kaplan-Meier representation of re-bleeding events in time and Fisher Exact test as hypothesis test for categorical variables using SPSS V2.0 software. The study was previously approved by IRB. Result(s): In total, eighty patients were treated during the period studied. Information concerning symptom response was available for 72 of 80 patients. The overall initial bleeding control rate was 81.9% (59/72). It was 85.7% (12/14), 100% (4/4), 76.5% (13/17), 78.3% (18/23), 77.8% (7/9), and 100% (5/5) in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. Re-bleeding incidence was 25.4% (15/59) of the patients with initial bleeding control, and when it occurred the median time was 8 weeks after the irradiation (range: 1 e 96 weeks). With salvage treatment, the final bleeding control was 64.3%, 100%, 76.5%, 78.3%, 75%, and 100% in H&N, GYN, Urinary, GI, Airway, and extremities, respectively. BED less than 30 Gy10 was not associated with a significant lower control (75.6% vs 92.3%, P = 0.113). Treatment interruptions due to death or worsening of clinical condition (8 cases) were more common in schedules with more than 5 fractions (20% vs 4%, P = 0.047). Conclusion(s): Independently of the fractionation used, radiation therapy was effective in resolving the bleeding from malignant tumors in the urgency scenario, with more than 80% of resolution. However, the probability of treatment discontinuation was greater with the use of more protracted schedules (more than five fractions).",Excluded
3829,"Pathological characteristics of cyst formation following gamma knife surgery for arteriovenous malformation Background: The pathological characteristics of cyst development after gamma knife surgery (GKS) for arteriovenous malformation (AVM) were analysed. Method(s): Sixteen male and 12 female patients aged 17-67 years (mean 31.3 years) were retrospectively identified among 868 patients who underwent GKS for AVM at our hospital. The pathological characteristics of the reddish nodular lesion and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst following GKS for AVM were examined. Result(s): Cyst was associated with chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma in 13, and with nodular lesion in 12 patients. The nidus volume at GKS was 0.1-36 ml (median 6.0 ml), and the prescription dose at the nidus margin was 18-25 Gy (median 20 Gy). Cyst formation was detected from 1.1 to 16 years (mean 7.3 years) after GKS. Seven of the 12 patients with nodular lesion underwent surgery. Ten of the 13 patients with expanding haematoma underwent surgical removal of expanding haematoma. Histological examination was possible in 17 cases. Dilated capillary vessels with wall damage such as hyalinisation and fibrinoid necrosis, marked protein exudation and haemorrhage were the most common findings. Brain parenchyma was observed among the dilated vessels in some cases. Structureless necrotic tissue was not evident. Conclusion(s): The present study suggests that enhanced nodular lesion on magnetic resonance imaging and chronic encapsulated expanding haematoma associated with cyst may have common aetiopathology caused by late radiation effects, mainly consisting of dilated capillary vessels with wall damage. Massive protein exudation from such damaged capillary vessels is important in cyst development.Copyright © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Excluded

We assessed the ability of our FLS to directly reduce re-fracture rate in patients with a history of fragility fractures. In this period were evaluated 553 patients, men and women above 50 years of age with a minimal trauma fracture. All patients were subjected to X-rays of the dorsal and lumbar spine, DXA scans, blood tests (calcium, 25OHVit D, PTH and creatinine clearance). All patients were supplemented with calcium and vitamin D treated with annual infusion of zoledronic acid 5 mg or semestral subcutaneous injection of denosumab 60 mg. The option for the mentioned drug was in order to facilitate adherence to treatment. Note that these scenarios the incident and prevalent cost of an osteoporotic fracture is on average $ 20,000, justifying the cost effectiveness of these drugs. 26 fractures were found; six of them occurred before the first 6 months of treatment.

4517,"CT-derived abdominal adiposity: Distributions and better predictive ability than BMI in a nationwide study of 59,429 adults in China Background: Although abdominal adiposity is associated with an altered cardiometabolic risk profile, the specific contribution of abdominal adipose tissue distribution remains not fully understood. Computed tomography (CT) is a well-established and precise method to measure abdominal adipose tissue distribution. The present study investigated abdominal adiposity assessed by CT in a large-scale Chinese population. Method(s): A total of 59,429 adults who underwent a low dose chest CT for lung cancer screening at one of 13 health checkup centers throughout China were evaluated. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) areas were measured at the center of the 2nd lumbar vertebra with Mindways quantitative CT software using the existing CT dataset without any additional radiation exposure. The ratio of visceral to total adipose tissue (TAT) areas (VAT/TAT ratio) was calculated and expressed as a percentage. Anthropometric indices including body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were also obtained. Result(s): BMI, waist circumference, VAT area, SAT area, and the VAT/TAT ratio were 25.0 +/- 3.0 kg/m2, 90 +/- 8 cm, 194 +/- 77 cm2, 85 +/- 41 cm2, and 69.5 +/- 9.1%, respectively, in men and 23.3 +/- 3.1 kg/m2, 79 +/- 8 cm, 120 +/- 57 cm2, 123 +/- 53 cm2, and 48.9 +/- 9.7% in women. With increasing age, VAT area and the VAT/TAT ratio increased in both sexes whereas SAT area decreased in men (P < 0.001 for all). After adjustment for BMI and waist circumference, older individuals showed higher VAT area and higher VAT/TAT ratio than younger subjects (P < 0.001 for all). Adjusted VAT areas in participants aged 75 or older was 45 cm2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41 cm2, 50 cm2) higher in men and 43 cm2 (95% CI: 37 cm2, 49 cm2) higher in women compared with participants aged 31-44 years. Additionally, differences in VAT area across age groups increased as BMI or waist circumference increased. VAT and SAT areas, but not the VAT/TAT ratio, were positively associated with BMI and waist circumference in every age group. Conclusion(s): In a nationwide study conducted in China, distributions of CT-derived measures of visceral and subcutaneous adiposity were found to vary significantly between sex and age groups. Our study also revealed that the proportion of VAT (an important driver of cardiometabolic risk) could not be predicted from BMI in a Chinese population.Copyright © 2020 The Authors",Excluded
4034,"Radiation-induced micro-RNA expression changes in peripheral blood cells of radiotherapy patients Purpose: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression, are involved in numerous physiologic processes in normal and malignant cells. Our in vivo study measured miRNA and gene expression changes in human blood cells in response to ionizing radiation, to develop miRNA signatures that can be used as biomarkers for radiation exposure. Methods and Materials: Blood from 8 radiotherapy patients in complete remission 1 or 2 was collected immediately before and 4 hours after total body irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays. Both miRNA and gene expression changes were measured by means of quantitative polymerase chain reaction and microarray hybridization, respectively. Hierarchic clustering, multidimensional scaling, class prediction, and gene ontology analysis were performed to investigate the potential of miRNAs to serve as radiation biomarkers and to elucidate their likely physiologic roles in the radiation response. Result(s): The expression levels of 45 miRNAs were statistically significantly upregulated 4 hours after irradiation with 1.25 Gy x-rays, 27 of them in every patient. Nonirradiated and irradiated samples form separate clusters in hierarchic clustering and multidimensional scaling. Out of 223 differentially expressed genes, 37 were both downregulated and predicted targets of the upregulated miRNAs. Paired and unpaired miRNA-based classifiers that we developed can predict the class membership of a sample with unknown irradiation status, with accuracies of 100% when all 45 upregulated miRNAs are included. Both miRNA control of and gene involvement in biologic processes such as hemopoiesis and the immune response are increased after irradiation, whereas metabolic processes are underrepresented among all differentially expressed genes and the genes controlled by miRNAs. Conclusion(s): Exposure to ionizing radiation leads to the upregulation of the expression of a considerable proportion of the human miRNAome of peripheral blood cells. These miRNA expression signatures can be used as biomarkers of radiation exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded
3694,"Dual-layer spectral computed tomography: Virtual non-contrast in comparison to true non-contrast images Purpose: To evaluate virtual-non-contrast (VNC) images obtained from clinical triphasic scans with a dual-layer spectral computed tomography system regarding accuracy of iodine subtraction. Material(s) and Method(s): From September to December 2016, 62 consecutive patients who underwent a clinical routine triphasic CT examination were included into this retrospective study. VNC images based on the arterial and portal venous phase were generated. For every patient and every contrast phase, a region-of-interest (ROI) was defined in aorta, liver, renal cortex, spongious bone, fat, muscle and fluid (i.e. gallbladder, urinary bladder), resulting in 2170 ROIs. VNC images were compared to true-non-contrast (TNC) images regarding difference in attenuation. Consistency between VNC images obtained from the arterial and portal venous phase as well as the influence of the initial attenuation on respective VNC images were evaluated. Result(s): Comparison of HU in VNC and TNC images showed a high accuracy of iodine elimination. Mean difference between TNC and VNC images was only 0.5 +/- 8.5 HU and >90% of all comparisons showed a difference of less than 15 HU. For all tissues but spongious bone, mean absolute difference between TNC and VNC images was below 10 HU. VNC images derived from the arterial and the portal venous phase showed excellent correlation. The quality of iodine removal in VNC images was not influenced by the original contrast enhancement. However, VNC images cannot be used for evaluation of iodine removal in bone as bone and iodine can hardly be differentiated via spectral CT. Conclusion(s): VNC imaging in DL-CT is a promising tool for daily clinical routine. As non-enhanced CT images are essential in multiple clinical situations, the permanent availability of VNC images with dual-layer spectral CT will result in a substantial reduction of radiation exposure and an increased diagnostic value of monophasic contrast-enhanced CT scans.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Excluded
3515,"Role of routine chest radiography after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy BACKGROUND: The role of routine chest radiography (CXR) after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) has been questioned., METHODS: We performed a prospective observational study, on a mixed medical/surgical critical care unit in a university teaching hospital. We studied all patients undergoing PDT as part of their critical care management from November 1, 2003 until July 31, 2007. All PDTs were performed under bronchoscopic guidance. After PDT, we reviewed the immediate post-procedural films to assess the utility of routine postoperative CXR. For the purposes of CXR review, we considered a procedure to be either uncomplicated or technically difficult. Clinically relevant CXR findings were new barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum) or a significant change in consolidation from the pre-procedure film., RESULTS: A total of 384 patients underwent PDT during the study period. Of these, 345 had immediate post-procedural CXRs available for review. There were 252 PDTs (73%) documented as uncomplicated. There were 93 (27%) technically difficult procedures, with 107 adverse events recorded. In 82 (24%) procedures, these difficulties were described as minor procedural complications [multiple attempts at needle insertion (> or = 3), minor bleeding or tracheal ring fracture]. Significant complications (mal-placement in the anterior mediastinum and major bleeding) were documented in 12 (3.5%) patients. New abnormalities were noted on 8 (2.3%) immediate post-procedural CXRs. In only one patient was there a new CXR change in an uncomplicated PDT., CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CXR after uncomplicated PDT performed under bronchoscopic guidance rarely reveals unexpected radiological abnormalities. The role of CXR after PDT appears to be restricted to those patients undergoing technically difficult and complicated procedures. A change in practice to this effect will lead to reductions in both medical costs and exposure of staff and patients to ionizing radiation.",Excluded

Visual acuity, complication data, and recurrence rates were recorded up to 120 months after brachytherapy., RESULTS: Median age at presentation was 63.0 years (range, 22-93). Median follow-up was 65.5 months (range, 2-180). Median radiation dose at the prescription point was 85.8 Gy (range, 51.8-103.7). Preservation of useful visual acuity, defined as better than 20/200, was noted in 43 of 74 (58%) of patients in the present study at 36 months compared with 50.1% of Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study participants. By 120 months, 17 of 30 (57%; 95% confidence interval, 45-69%) progressed to visual acuity worse than 20/200, whereas 9 of 30 (30%) retained visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and 4 of 30 (13%) were 20/50-20/200. The rate of retinopathy after radiation was approximately 40% of all those observed by 60 months. Baseline visual acuity, apical tumor height, American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor category, and distance between the tumor and the fovea were all significantly associated with loss of visual acuity. The local tumor control rate by 60 months of follow-up was 93% (95% confidence interval, 85-97%)., CONCLUSIONS: The OSU-Nag custom (125)I plaque is an effective treatment for uveal melanoma, with preservation of useful visual acuity in 58% of eyes 3 years after treatment and 43% of eyes 10 years after treatment.

3638,"Prospective assessment of gustatory function after radiotherapy for head and neck cancers Background: Taste disorders are major causes of morbidity in patients undergoing head and neck irradiation. We quantitatively assessed the gustatory function of patients with head and neck cancers who underwent radiotherapy using recently developed standardised tools for measuring taste. Method(s): Twenty patients undergoing head and neck irradiation responded to a specific questionnaire and were assessed by olfactory and gustatory function tests. To assess changes over time, testing was performed before, immediately after, and at 2- and 4-week intervals following the start of radiotherapy. Concurrently, patients were evaluated for xerostomia from radiotherapy. Result(s): A decrease in the taste recognition threshold was observed in the second week after the beginning of radiotherapy. The taste detection threshold improved within the 14th-18th week. Most affected patients demonstrated that their gustatory function primarily decreased independent of the olfactory function. Disturbances in taste were exponentially worsened beyond an accumulated dose of 30 Gy and involved all tastants. According to a multivariate analysis, radiation-induced taste impairment was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia. However, there was an association between the dose of irradiation and the severity of taste disturbance. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary study, we found that the taste function was worse 2 weeks after the start of radiotherapy and returned to pretreatment levels within 4.5 months. Taste disturbances were exponentially worse beyond an accumulated dose of 20 Gy. Taste dysfunction after radiotherapy was not influenced by the degree of xerostomia, whereas only the dose of irradiation was associated with the severity of taste dysfunction.Copyright © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Excluded
3896,"Changes in tumor oxygenation during combined treatment with split- course radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer Purpose: To evaluate the changes in tumor oxygenation during definitive split-course radiochemotherapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer (lymph nodes and primaries). Material(s) and Method(s): Twenty-four patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were investigated pretherapeutically and during a defined course of radiochemotherapy (RCTh) with a total dose of 70 Gy given in 35 fractions over 9 weeks (2-week break after 30 Gy). In weeks 1 and 6, the patients received chemotherapy (5 FU and mitomycin C) concomitant with irradiation. The oxygen partial pressure measurements were carried out using polarographic needle probes in combination with a microprocessor-controlled device (pO2 histograph/KIMOC). Times of measurements were before therapy, at the end of week 3 (30 Gy), after a 2- week break (30 Gy) and at the end of therapy if measurable lesion was found (70 Gy). Result(s): There was a significant reduction in the median pO2 (P < 0.005, n = 18) and an increase in the hypoxic fraction (defined as the percentage of pO2 values of <5 mm Hg) after application of 30 Gy (P < 0.05, n = 18). This effect was partially reversed at the end of the 2-week break. During the break an increase in the median pO2 (P = 0.05, n = 12) and a decrease in the hypoxic fraction could be observed. Towards the end of therapy (70 Gy) a significant decrease (P = 0.02, n = 13) in the median pO2 occurred. Corresponding to this, the hypoxic fraction increased during the last 4 weeks of therapy (P = 0.06, n = 13). Conclusion(s): Statistically significant changes in oxygenation in locally advanced head and neck cancer were found during a split-course radiochemotherapy. This information was obtained in a homogenous group of patients under well-defined therapeutic conditions. The decrease in the tumor oxygenation status at doses of 30 and 70 Gy are important findings because they are in contrast to the concept of continuous improvement of the oxygenation status during fractionated radiotherapy.",Excluded

4249,"Utilization of stem cells in alginate for nucleus pulposus tissue engineering In a general view of anatomy, intervertebral disc is composed of three parts: annulus fibrosus (AF), nucleus pulposus (NP), and cartilage endplate (CEP). Recently, several types of stem cells were successfully isolated from these corresponding regions, but up to now, no research was performed about which kind of stem cells is the most efficient candidate for NP tissue engineering or for stem cell-based disc regeneration therapy. In this study, we compared the regenerative potentials of the above-mentioned three kinds of disc-derived stem cells with that of the classic bone marrow (BM)-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a rabbit disc degeneration model. By magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), X-ray, histology, etc. evaluations, we found that cartilage endplate-derived stem cells (CESCs) showed superior capacity compared with the annulus fibrosus-derived stem cells (AFSCs), nucleus pulposus-derived stem cells (NPSCs), and BM-MSCs (p<0.05); additionally, when comparing the CESC group with the normal control group, there existed no statistical difference in X-ray (p>0.05). Those results demonstrated that the CESC-seeded alginate construct performed the most powerful ability for NP regeneration, while AFSCs showed the most inferior potency, NPSCs and BM-MSCs had similar regenerative capacity and located in the middle. All in all, our study showed that CESCs might act as an efficient seed cell source for NP tissue engineering, which paved a new way for the biological solution of disc degeneration diseases. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",Excluded

The inclusion criteria include closed capitellar fracture, normal anterior elbow joint movement before injury, and recent capitellar fracture with injury within past 3 weeks. Fractures classified according to Dubberley included four cases of type IB, eight cases of type IIB, and 12 cases of type IIIB. Radiographic evaluation was performed. Surgery time, blood loss, range of motion of the elbow, forearm rotation, and complications were recorded. Elbow joint function was evaluated by Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS). Result(s): The mean follow-up period was 19.6 months (range, 12-36 months). The average clinical healing time for fractures was 11.2 +/- 3.2 weeks (range, 8-20 weeks). Fracture united in all patients. Two patients showed slight delayed union, but union was achieved eventually. The mean time from injury to surgery was 6.3 +/- 3.1 days (range, 2-15 days). The average surgical time was 68.1 +/- 11.5 min (range, 50-90 min), and the mean blood loss was 75.2 +/- 26.5 mL (range, 40-120 mL). The mean range of flexion was 122.5degree +/- 10.5degree(range, 95degree-140degree). The mean range of extension was 8.5degree +/- 5.8degree(range, 0degree-20degree). The mean range of pronation was 79.7degree +/- 8.0degree(range, 65degree-90degree). The mean range of supination was 80.5degree +/- 7.1degree(range, 60degree-90degree).

4159,"Relation between quantitative coronary CTA and myocardial ischemia by adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion Background: Coronary-computed tomography angiography (CTA) has limited accuracy to predict myocardial ischemia. Besides luminal area stenosis, other coronary plaque morphology and composition parameters may help to assess ischemia. With the integration of coronary CTA and adenosine stress CT myocardial perfusion (CTP), reliable information regarding coronary anatomy and function can be derived in one procedure. This analysis aimed to investigate the association between coronary stenosis severity, plaque composition and morphology and the presence of ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. Methods and Results: 84 patients (age, 62 +/- 10 years; 48% men) who underwent sequential coronary CTA and adenosine stress myocardial CT perfusion were analyzed. Automated quantification was performed in all coronary lesions (quantitative CTA). Downstream myocardial ischemia was assessed by visual analysis of the rest and stress CTP images and defined as a summed difference score of >=1. One or more coronary plaques were present in 146 coronary arteries of which 31 (21%) were ischemia-related. Of the lesions with a stenosis percentage <50%, 50%-70%, and >70%, respectively, 9% (6/67), 18% (9/51), and 57% (16/28) demonstrated downstream ischemia. Furthermore, mean plaque burden, plaque volume, lesion length, maximal plaque thickness, and dense calcium volume were significantly higher in ischemia-related lesions, but only stenosis severity (%) (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.02-1.10; P = .006) and lesion length (mm) (OR 1.26; 95% CI 1.02-1.55; P = .029) were independent correlates. Conclusion(s): Increasing stenosis percentage by quantitative CTA is positively correlated to myocardial ischemia measured with adenosine stress myocardial CTP. However, stenosis percentage remains a moderate determinant. Lumen area stenosis and lesion length were independently associated with ischemia, adjusted for coronary plaque volume, mean plaque burden, maximal lesion thickness, and dense calcium volume.Copyright © 2016, The Author(s).",Excluded
3997,"Interaural intensity difference and ear advantage in listening to dichotic consonant-vowel syllable pairs The right-ear advantage (REA) is typically observed in verbal dichotic listening, indicating a left hemisphere superiority for speech processing. The REA could be thought of as a bottom-up, stimulus-driven laterality effect, caused by the preponderance of the contralateral neural fibers from the right ear to the auditory/speech processing areas in the left temporal lobe. The REA can, however, be modified by explicitly requiring the listeners to focus their attention alternatively on the left or right-ear stimuli, thus either countering or enhancing the bottom-up processes through top-down attentional control. In the present study, we manipulated the strength of the bottom-up REA by inducing an intensity difference between the right-ear and left-ear speech inputs in order to make the REA either weaker (left-ear input>right-ear input) or stronger (left-ear input<right-ear input) and also examined how this manipulation affected the top-down attention modulation effects. Twenty healthy participants listened to dichotic presentations of consonant-vowel syllable pairs with different attention instructions. The results showed that the interaural intensity difference significantly affected the ear advantage in the predicted way. It also interacted with the top-down control effects, attentional control having a stronger effect when attending to the ear that had a weaker sound intensity, as compared to when the intensities were equal.",Excluded

Disease-free and overall survival rates in NMM+ patients in group 1 were worse compared with NMM- patients (P =.014 and P =.003, respectively) but comparable with ypN1 patients (n = 11). Conclusions A 30% reduction of NMM+ was obtained after neoadjuvant treatment in (y)pN0 patients. NMM+ after CRT had a negative impact on survival in ypN1 patients.

4276,"Radiation therapy in cancer patients 80 years of age and older There is a paucity of clinical data regarding radiation therapy in elderly patients. This is a retrospective study of all patients aged 80 years and older who underwent treatment with external beam irradiation at a single site. There were a total of 183 patients treated with 226 courses of therapy. The mean age was 84 years (range: 80-98 years). Fifty-eight percent of the patients were male. The treatment was deemed palliative in 51% and curative in 49%. The primary cancer diagnoses were: prostate 36, lung 28, breast 25, head and neck 23, gastrointestinal 21, hematologic 12, gynecologic 11, skin 11, genitourinary 9, unknown primary 6, central nervous system 1. The patients were able to complete the prescribed therapy in 173 of 226 courses (77%). Treatment breaks during the radiation courses were required in 81 (36%) of the courses. Radiation therapy can be safely administered to an elderly population with both curative and palliative intent with the expectation of completion in more than 80% of patients. The reasons for inability to complete therapy as prescribed are multifactorial, but careful patient selection and attention to comorbidity may optimize outcome. Further research is needed to better define these parameters.",Excluded
4199,"When cervical pain is actually migraine: An observational study in 207 patients Introduction: A large proportion of migraine patients remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed in Italy. In our experience, many migraineurs self-diagnose their condition as ""cervical pain attack"" or ""cervical pain syndrome"" (CP), assuming cervical spine pathology as the cause. We aimed to phenotype and classify the headache of patients with self-diagnosed CP, and to describe this sample of patients. Method(s): Consecutive patients aged 18 to 75 years, referred to the Headache Center of the Mondino Institute (Pavia, Italy) for a first visit for headache, completed a questionnaire about CP and were subsequently examined by an experienced clinician. Result(s): Out of 207 patients, 132 (64%) believed they suffered from CP. According to ICHD-IIIbeta criteria, these patients suffered from migraine or probable migraine in 91% of cases. The great majority of patients who believed that they suffered from CP underwent unnecessary medical exams (including radiation exposure in 40% of cases) and used treatments that were inadequate for their real diagnosis. Conclusion(s): The majority of patients with CP suffer from typical migraine. The misdiagnosis produces an economic burden (for patients and the health care system) and leads to impaired quality of life of patients.Copyright © 2016, © International Headache Society 2016.",Excluded
3690,"The association between cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe oral mucositis in head and neck cancers during radiotherapy Background: Quality of life can be influenced by oral mucositis (OM), and it is necessary to implement OM management strategies before the initiation of radiotherapy (RT) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Aim(s): To examine the association between the cumulative radiation dose and the incidence of severe OM in HNC patients receiving RT. Methods and Results: A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, in Japan. We retrospectively analyzed 94 patients with HNC who developed OM during RT. We defined OM as a more than grade 2 OM. The cumulative incidence of OM curves of the two categories was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. We estimated the hazard ratio (HR) for OM after the adjustment of factors for covariates using Cox's regression analysis. Patients with smoking history had a significantly later development of OM than those with no smoking history (20 Gy-incidence OM 68.7% vs 39.7%, P =.003). In contrast, patients undergoing concurrent chemotherapy had an earlier development of OM than those undergoing RT alone (20 Gy-incidence OM 24.2% vs 55.7%, P <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy were independent predictive factors, with a HR of 0.526 (P =.025) and 2.690 (P <.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We demonstrated that no smoking history and concurrent chemotherapy may be predictive of OM in HNC patients.Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

4420,"Linear accelerator-based stereotactic body radiation therapy in the treatment of oligometastatic disease The present study reports the clinical outcomes of hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for oligometastasis (OM) originating from various tumors. Between February 2012 and April 2017, 40 patients with unresectable OM were treated with SBRT. Of these patients, 92% showed a solitary nodal metastasis and the rest had up to three metas-tases. The dose prescription was 50 Gy in 10 fractions with three-dimensional conformal techniques or volumetric inten-sity-modulated arc therapy. Median follow-up was 14 months. Of the 40 patients, none showed local progression at the site of SBRT, but 20 patients showed tumor growth at distant sites during follow-up. The 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 45.1 and 36.1%, respectively. The 2- and 3-year progression-free survival rates were 35.4 and 26.5%, respectively. The interval between diagnosis and detection of OM (<2 vs. >2 years) and primary tumor site (esophagus vs. others) emerged as significant variables affecting survival. Grade 3 subacute and grade 4 chronic toxicities were observed in 1 and 2 patients, respectively. SBRT of 50 Gy in 10 fractions for OM from various primary tumors was shown to lead to good clinical outcomes from the viewpoints of local control and toxicity frequency. However, additional studies are required to identify the patient groups likely to receive maximal benefits from such treatment.Copyright © 2020, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.",Excluded
4521,"Possible involvement of the facial nucleus in regulation of respiration in rats The facial nucleus (FN) has been known as a motor nucleus to control the activity of the facial skeletal muscles by its efferent somatic motoneurons. Much less, however, is known about the non-motor control functions of its interneurons. The present study was designed to investigate if the interneurons of the FN participate in controlling rhythmic respiration in the sodium thiopental-anesthetized and vagotomized Sprague-Dawley rats with facial motoneurons retrogradely degenerated with techniques of electrical and chemical stimulation of the FN and extracellular recording of discharge of neurons in the FN. Single pulse stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms) of the FN during inspiration caused a transient restrain in phrenic discharge. Short train stimulation (75-100 microA, 0.2 ms, 100 Hz, 3-5 pulses) delivered during the early- or mid-term of inspiration augmented the inspiratory duration, but switched the inspiration off when delivered during the later stage of inspiration. Short train stimulation delivered during expiration prolonged the expiratory duration. Continuous stimulation could inhibit the inspiration. Microinjection of kainic acid into the FN caused an augmentation in inspiratory duration and amplitude and in expiratory duration. These data indicate that the interneurons of the FN might participate in the modulation of respiration. Different discharge patterns of interneurons in the FN, interestingly some respiratory related patterns, were observed, which provide a possible structural basis for the role of the FN in respiratory regulation.",Excluded
4357,"Assessing Sensorimotor Function Following ISS with Computerized Dynamic Posturography INTRODUCTION: Postflight postural ataxia reflects both the control strategies adopted for movement in microgravity and the direct effects of deconditioning. Computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) has been used during the first decade of the International Space Station (ISS) expeditions to quantify the initial postflight decrements and recovery of postural stability., METHODS: The CDP data were obtained on 37 crewmembers as part of their pre- and postflight medical examinations. Sensory organization tests evaluated the ability to make effective use of (or suppress inappropriate) visual, vestibular, and somatosensory information for balance control. This report focuses on eyes closed conditions with either a fixed or sway-referenced base of support, with the head erect or during pitch-head tilts (+/- 20degree at 0.33 Hz). Equilibrium scores were derived from peak-to-peak anterior-posterior sway. Motor-control tests were also used to evaluate a crewmember's ability to automatically recover from unexpected support-surface perturbations., RESULTS: The standard Romberg condition was the least sensitive. Dynamic head tilts led to increased incidence of falls and revealed significantly longer recovery than head-erect conditions. Improvements in postflight postural performance during the later expeditions may be attributable to higher preflight baselines and/or advanced exercise capabilities aboard the ISS., CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic assessment of postural instability is more pronounced during unstable-support conditions requiring active head movements. In addition to supporting return-to-duty decisions by flight surgeons, the CDP provides a standardized sensorimotor measure that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures designed to either minimize deconditioning on orbit or promote reconditioning upon return to Earth.",Excluded
4111,"Heavy ion radiotherapy in lung cancer (Introduction) In radiotherapy of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), carbon ion beams offer improved dose distributions as compared to photon beams and thus enable dose escalation within a target while sparing the surrounding normal tissues. Furthermore, carbon ions being heavier than protons provide a higher biological effectiveness, which increases with depth, reaching the maximum at the end of the range. At the National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), clinical research on carbon ion radiotherapy (C-ion RT) was started in 1994 using carbon-ions generated by Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba (HIMAC). So far, almost 6,000 patients have been treated, where the benefit of C-ion RT over other modalities has been demonstrated in terms of high local control rates and a significant reduction in overall treatment time with acceptable toxicities in most cases. In this paper, the results of treatment for Stage I NSCLC using 9 and 4 fractions are reviewed, as well as preliminary results of single fraction treatment is described. Also, results of other RT reported in the literatures are compared. (Methods and materials) Stage I lung cancer is divided into two types depending on tumor location: peripheral-type and central-type. This classification is made on the assumption that the two types may tolerate radiation differently. Therefore, different fractionation regimens were investigated for each type. The patients eligible for either treatment are those for whom surgery was not indicated due to medical reasons or refusal. From 1999 to 2003, a total of 131 tumors in129 patients received C-ion RT with 9 fractions and 4 fractions, including 94 males and 37 females with an average age of 74.5 years. Out of the 131 foci, there were 72 T1 tumors and 59 T2 tumors. There were 85 adenocarcinomas, 43 epidermoid cancers and 3 other types. Regarding dose fractionations, 51 cases were treated with 72.0GyE/9 fractions, and 80 cases were treated with 52.8GyE/4fr for stage IA and 60.0GyE/4fr for stage IB. Since 2003, a doseescalation study using single fraction treatment has been conducted for peripheral-type NSCLC. The initial dose was 28.0 GyE, which was then escalated at increments of 5%. At each dose level, about 10 to 30 patients were registered for evaluation of toxicity and local control with carbon ions. C-ion RT has also been applied to locally advanced lung cancers and hilar-type cancers, and case studies are being accumulated. The locally advanced lung cancers included Pancoast tumors and mediastinal-type tumors in stages II-IIIA. (Results) All of the patients treated with 9 fractions/3 weeks (50 patients) and 4 fractions/1 week (79 patients) developed no evidence of severe toxicities. The 5-year local control rates were 98.6% for stage-IA cases and 89.7% for stage- IB cases, and the 5-year survival rates were 63.1% for stage-IA cases and 50.0% for stage-IB cases. In single fraction treatment, a total of 218 patients have been registered, in which the total dose has been escalated from 28.0 to 48.0 GyE. So far, no serious adverse events have been observed, and local control appears to be improving with increasing total dose. For skin reactions, six grade 2 toxicity (3.3%) but no grade 3 or higher was observed. For radiation pneumonitis, only one grade 1 was reported, and no toxicities greater than grade 2 occurred. The overall local control rate was 91.8%, and the causespeci fic survival rate at 5-years was 71.8%. The superficial lesions arising at the hilar region have been successfully treated with acceptable toxicities. Similarly, in the preoperative radiotherapy for patients with chest wall invasion, high anti-tumor effect was confirmed in the pathological findings after the lung was surgically removed. (Discussion) Only at NIRS, Japan, NSCLC has been treated with carbon ions. For peripheral tumor, we have been conducting clinical studies to establish a short-course, hypo-fractionated radiotherapy. We first performed a dose-escalation study using 18 fractions/6 weeks. The number of fractions and treatment times were subsequently reduced to 9 fractions over 3 weeks, 4 fractions over one week, and eventually to a single fraction treatment. The preliminary data suggested favorable local control and very few toxic reactions with a median follow up time of about 16 months. Compared with pulmonary damage reported for stereotactic radiotherapy in stage I lung cancer, the incidence and severity in our patients seemed to be remarkably low. The decreased adverse effects on the lung are likely achieved due to the small volume irradiated. When comparing proton vs C-ion RT, local control results are comparable for T1 tumors, but for T2 tumors 2-5 year local control rates are higher in C-ion RT. It is of note that in most reported data for proton therapy, follow-up periods are short relative to the time required for full evaluation of TCP, late NTCP and survival. Considering that the average age of the patients receiving C-ion RT was about 75 years, about 10 years older than that of 65 years in the operated patients, the results of C-ion RT for stage-I lung cancer may be comparable to surgical results. Thus, the single-fraction irradiation method may be described as the ultimate type of treatment using carbon ion, and would be a valid alternative to surgery, especially for elderly and inoperable patients.",Excluded
4496,"Feasibility of myocardial perfusion imaging with half the radiation dose in obese patients using ordered-subset expectation maximization with resolution recovery software Background: We previously described the feasibility of myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with nearly half the radiation dose using ordered-subset expectation maximization with resolution recovery (OSEM-RR) processing. This study sought to determine if the findings can be expanded to obese patients. Method(s): Fifty obese patients (>100 kg) referred for MPI underwent stress-rest or rest-stress studies with a half dose of Tc-99m sestamibi in a 1-day protocol using OSEM-RR processing. Image quality and clinical results were compared with matched patients (by age, sex, weight, presence/probability of coronary artery disease) evaluated with standard ""full-dose"" Tc-99m sestamibi, mostly in a 2-day protocol. Dose activities were adjusted individually by weight. Result(s): Mean Tc-99m activity was 33.4 +/- 13.9 mCi in the half-dose group and 60 +/- 10 mCi in the full-dose group (P <.0001). Respective mean effective doses per study were 10 +/- 4 and 18 +/- 3 mSv (P <.0001). Overall image quality was good-to-excellent in 94% of the half-dose group and 80% of the full-dose group (P <.045). There was no between-group difference in rate or size of ischemia or infarction, except for stress left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusion(s): MPI with half the radiation dose is feasible in obese patients. Image quality is better than for full-dose MPI, and the procedure can be performed in 1 day. © 2012 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.",Excluded
3478,"Small Cell Lung Cancer. Methodology and Preliminary Results of the SMALL CELL Study INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive histologic type of lung cancer, and accounts for approximately 10%-15% of all cases. Few studies have analyzed the effect of residential radon. Our aim is to determine the risk factors of SCLC., METHODS: We designed a multicenter, hospital-based case-control study with the participation of 11 hospitals in 4 autonomous communities., RESULTS: Results of the first 113 cases have been analyzed, 63 of which included residential radon measurements. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years; 11% of cases were younger than 50 years of age; 22% were women; 57% had extended disease; and 95% were smokers or former smokers. Median residential radon concentration was 128Bq/m3. Concentrations higher than 400Bq/m3 were found in 8% of cases. The only remarkable difference by gender was the percentage of never smokers, which was higher in women compared to men (P<.001). Radon concentration was higher in patients with stageIV disease (non-significant difference) and in individuals diagnosed at 63 years of age or older (P=.032)., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of SCLC cases are diagnosed early and there is a predominance of disseminated disease at diagnosis. Residential radon seems to play an important role on the onset of this disease, with some cases having very high indoor radon concentrations. Copyright © 2017 SEPAR.

3485,"Radiation sensitivity in vitro of primary tumors and metastatic lesions of malignant melanoma The radiation sensitivity of cells isolated directly from surgical specimens of the primary tumor and one to three distant metastases in ten different melanoma patients was measured in vitro using the Courtenay soft agar colony assay. Dose-response curves were fitted to the cell survival data by the method of least squares using the multitarget-single hit and the linear-quadratic models. The ten patients could be divided into three distinct groups. Group I consisted of four patients with radioresistant primary tumors (D0s from 1.38 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.69 +/- 0.08 Gy). The radiation sensitivity of the metastases (D0s from 1.33 +/- 0.10 Gy to 1.73 +/- 0.06 Gy) was not significantly different from that of the primary tumor in this group; i.e., no heterogeneity was observed. Group II consisted of three patients with radiosensitive primary tumors (D0s from 0.84 +/- 0.06 Gy to 0.91 +/- 0.05 Gy). Heterogeneity was not observed in this group either; i.e., all metastases were radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.00 +/- 0.06 Gy). Group III consisted of three patients with a heterogeneous disease. The primary tumor of all patients in this group was radiosensitive (D0s from 0.85 +/- 0.05 Gy to 1.03 +/- 0.05 Gy). The most radioresistant metastasis in each patient was significantly (P much less than 0.05) more resistant (D0s from 1.46 +/- 0.06 Gy to 1.56 +/- 0.07 Gy) than the primary tumor. None of the metastases were significantly more radiosensitive than the primary tumor in any patient. These observations suggest that the progression of tumors to increased levels of malignancy includes the increased ability to become radioresistant, and it may be speculated that similar genomic alterations are responsible for the development of the metastatic and the radioresistant tumor cell phenotype. If so, this may have severe implications for the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with low linear energy transfer ionizing radiation as well as for the development of predictive assays for tumor treatment sensitivity.",Excluded
4198,"Surgery rates in Danish incident cases of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease in the era of biological treatment a seven-year cohort study follow up Background: Resent studies indicate that biological treatment (anti TNF alpha treatment) reduces surgery rates. We aim in this seven-year follow-up study of unselected, incident patients diagnosed with Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis to assess surgery rates in the era of biological treatment. Method(s): From Jan. 1st 2003 to Dec. 31st 2004 all incident cases of patients diagnosed with CD (n = 208), UC (n = 328) or indeterminate colitis (IC, n = 27) were registered in a well defined Copenhagen area. All medical journals applicable for follow-up were reviewed and data on disease localization and behaviour according to the Montreal classifications, medications, endoscopies, X-ray-/CT-/MR-procedures, admissions, surgical events, cancers and deaths were registered. Result(s): The present follow-up study cohort consists of 186 CD and 265 UC. Of the 563 patients originally included in the study, 42 patients were excluded at follow-up. Twenty-eight patients did not have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 14 were not incident and 5 had IC. Eighteen (10 UC, 8 CD) were lost to follow-up and 47 (28 UC, 19 CD) deceased and were also excluded. The mean age in the present study was 38.7 years (median 35.0 range 1-93) and included 265 females and 251 males. All patients were followed for 7 years from diagnosis. For UC, 32 patients (12.1%) had a colectomy during the 7 years follow-up. Incidence of colectomy at 5 years was 9.8% (26 patients) and 8.7% (23) at 2 years. Fifty-two CD patients (28%) had their first intestinal resection (excluding fistula- and/or abscess's surgery) within 7 years follow-up. Forty-five (24.2%) had a resection within 5 years and 35 (18.8%) within 2 years follow-up. At 7 years follow-up 28 (8.0%) UC patients and 49 (26.6%) CD patients had at some point had biological treatment. Conclusion(s): Twenty-eight percent CD patients and 12.1% UC patients had their first surgery within 7 years follow-up. The surgical rates for CD in the present study in ""the biological era"" are lower than a previous Danish inception cohort from 1962-87 with surgical rates of 63% during ten years. However, it seems comparable to the surgery rates referred by the IBSEN study group, who reported 5 year surgical rates of CD and UC to 28.0% and 7.5% respectively in the mid-nineties.

3526,"Biodistribution, radiation dose estimates, and in vivo Pgp modulation studies of 18F-paclitaxel in nonhuman primates UNLABELLED: Multidrug resistance (MDR) associated with increased expression and function of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux pump often causes chemotherapeutic failure in cancer. To provide insight into both the dynamics of the pump and the effects of MDR, we radiolabeled paclitaxel, a substrate for the Pgp pump, with (18)F to study MDR in vivo with PET. We obtained biodistribution and radiation dose estimates for (18)F-paclitaxel (FPAC) in monkeys and studied the effects of a Pgp blocker (XR9576, tariquidar) on FPAC kinetics., METHODS: Paired baseline and Pgp modulation (2 mg/kg XR9576) 4-h whole-body dynamic PET scans were obtained in 3 rhesus monkeys after injection of FPAC. Measured residence times were extrapolated to humans and radiation dose estimates were obtained using MIRDOSE3.1. The postmodulator area under the time-activity curves (AUCs) and Logan plot slopes, a measure of tracer distribution volume (equilibrium tissue-to-plasma ratio) that is inversely proportional to tracer efflux, were compared with baseline values to determine changes in FPAC distribution., RESULTS: Cumulative activities of the organs sampled accounted for 80% of the injected dose. The critical organ is gallbladder wall (0.19 mGy/MBq [0.69 rad/mCi]), followed by liver (0.14 mGy/MBq [0.52 rad/mCi]); the effective dose is 0.022 mSv/MBq (0.083 rem/mCi). XR9576 preinfusion changed the Logan plot slope for liver by +104% (P = 0.02), lung by +87% (P = 0.11), and kidney by -14% (P = 0.08). Changes in the mean AUC (normalized to the plasma AUC) were +54% (P = 0.08), +97% (P = 0.04), and -12% (P = 0.02), respectively, for liver, lung, and kidney. No significant difference was found in the metabolite-corrected plasma AUC (normalized to the injected dose) between the baseline and XR9576 modulator studies (P = 0.69)., CONCLUSION: Under Radioactive Drug Research Committee guidelines, 266 MBq (7.2 mCi) FPAC can be administered to humans up to 3 times a year. The increase in FPAC accumulation in liver and lung after XR9576 is consistent with Pgp inhibition and demonstrates the potential of FPAC to evaluate MDR.",Excluded
4483,"Prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center in Brazil Objective: Anxiety disorders have been shown to undermine the quality of life of cancer patients. Unfortunately, medical professionals often neglect to screen for anxiety in their patients. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of anxiety in patients awaiting diagnostic procedures in an oncology center waiting room, and to investigate possible relationships between anxiety and demographic and clinical variables. Method(s): A cross-sectional study was performed with 398 patients who completed a self-administered questionnaire containing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Result(s): Results of the HADS indicated that 38% of participants had anxiety, while data from the STAI showed that 46% had either high state or trait anxiety. The most frequently cited source of anxiety was concern over test results. Age, gender, employment status, and education level were correlated with anxiety. Conclusion(s): The prevalence of anxiety is high among patients awaiting diagnostic procedures. Patients in the waiting room should be routinely screened for anxiety. Careful assessment and treatment of anxiety are important components in the care of patients with cancer. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Excluded
3994,"Recurrent Atypical Meningiomas: Combining Surgery and Radiosurgery in One Effective Multimodal Treatment Objective Owing to their rarity and proteiform pathologic features, the clinical behavior of atypical meningiomas is not yet well characterized. Though the extent of resection is believed to be a key determinant of prognosis, limited data exist regarding optimal management of patients with recurrent disease. Methods In this 20-year retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of 46 patients with recurrent atypical meningomas (185 lesions, 89 of which were local, 78 marginal, and 18 distant recurrences); treatment was radiosurgery (n = 60), surgery (n = 56), or both (n = 8). The median follow-up period was 53 months. Outcome measures were length of overall survival and disease-free intervals and prognostic factors for survival. Results Overall, the median progression-free survival was 26 months at the first recurrence and 100 months thereafter (the sum of the later intervals). Multivariate analysis showed that no treatment-related factors influenced prognosis, whereas recurrence at the skull base was a significant tumor-related factor limiting further treatment. Irrespective of treatment type, the recurrence-free interval was increasingly shorter during the clinical course, with a higher occurrence of marginal and distant lesions migrating to the midline and to the skull base. In sporadic cases, disease-free intervals were longer after wide craniotomy, tumor and dural resection with tumor-free margin. Conclusions The disease-free interval was substantially similar after surgery and radiosurgery for treating recurrent disease in patients with atypical meningiomas. Surgery is the mainstay for prolonging survival, while radiosurgery can be an adjuvant strategy to gain time for clinical observation and planning aggressive surgical treatment.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

3851,"Dosimetric Correlate of Cardiac-Specific Survival Among Patients Undergoing Coronary Artery Stenting After Thoracic Radiotherapy for Cancer OBJECTIVES: To retrospectively evaluate outcomes among cancer survivors previously treated with thoracic radiotherapy (RT) who later underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)., METHODS: From 1998 to 2012, 76 patients first received curative RT (>30 Gy, except for Hodgkin lymphoma patients) involving the heart and lungs followed by PCI. Heart and lung-specific dosimetric parameters were correlated with overall survival (OS) and cardiac-specific survival by Cox variate methods., RESULTS: The mean interval between cancer diagnosis and PCI was 3.7 years (range, 0.1 to 12.6 y). Median follow-up since cancer diagnosis was 5.5 years. At analysis, 46 patients (61%) were alive, 5 (7%) died of cardiac causes, and 9 (12%) of cancer. Higher maximum RT heart dose was related to poorer OS since PCI (P=0.009). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (P=0.005) and higher mean heart dose (P<0.001) were related to poorer OS since cancer diagnosis. beta-Blockers, higher mean heart dose (hazard ratio [HR]=1.49, P<0.001), and percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=40 Gy for heart doses (HR=1.32, P<0.001) were associated with poorer non-cancer-specific survival since cancer diagnosis. Diabetes (HR=3.84, P=0.008) and increased percentage of targeted volume or organ receiving >=45 Gy (HR=1.01 per additional 100 cm irradiated, P=0.01) for the heart decreased major adverse cardiac event-free survival., CONCLUSIONS: Prior heart and lung-directed RT had volume-dependent and dose-dependent adverse effects on long-term cardiac outcomes for patients subsequently treated with PCI. RT planning that minimizes heart and lung irradiation doses should be encouraged.",Excluded
4408,"Incidence of dementia among atomic-bomb survivors--Radiation Effects Research Foundation Adult Health Study Radiotherapy has been reported to cause neuropsychological dysfunction. Here we examined whether exposure to atomic bomb radiation affected the incidence of dementia among 2286 atomic bomb survivors and controls - all members of the Adult Health Study cohort. Study subjects were non-demented and aged >or=60 years at baseline examination and had been exposed in 1945 at >or=13 years of age to a relatively low dose (<or=4 Gy), compared with total dose from radiotherapy. Dementia diagnoses were made during biennial health examinations with a two-phase procedure. DSM IV criteria were used for diagnosing dementia, NINCDS-ADRDA for Alzheimer disease, and NINDS-AIREN for vascular disease. To estimate the effect of radiation on the dementia incidence rate, we applied Poisson regression analysis. Incidence per 1000 person-years was 16.3 in the <5 mGy group, 17.0 in the 5-499 mGy group, and 15.2 in the >or=500 mGy group. Alzheimer disease was the predominant type of dementia in each dose category. After adjustment for potential risk factors, radiation exposure did not affect the incidence rate of either all dementia or any of its subtypes. No case of dementia had a history of therapeutic cranial irradiation. Although we found no relationship between radiation exposure and the development of dementia among atomic bomb survivors exposed at >or=13 years old in this longitudinal study, effects on increased risk of early death among atomic bomb survivors will be considered.",Included

Thirty prospectively enrolled patients underwent non-contrast CTC at 120 kVp/10 mAs in supine and 100 kVp/10 mAs in prone positions, followed by same-day colonoscopy. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP), 80% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR80), and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR). A commercial CAD system was applied and per-polyp sensitivities and numbers of false-positives (FPs) were compared among algorithms., RESULTS: Mean effective radiation dose of CTC was 1.02 mSv. Of 101 polyps detected and removed by colonoscopy, 61 polyps were detected on supine and on prone CTC datasets on consensus unblinded review, resulting in 122 visible polyps (32 polyps<6 mm, 52 6-9.9 mm, and 38>=10 mm). Per-polyp sensitivity of CAD for all polyps was highest with MBIR (56/122, 45.9%), followed by ASIR80 (54/122, 44.3%) and FBP (43/122, 35.2%), with significant differences between FBP and IR algorithms (P<0.017). Per-polyp sensitivity for polyps>=10 mm was also higher with MBIR (25/38, 65.8%) and ASIR80 (24/38, 63.2%) than with FBP (20/38, 58.8%), albeit without statistical significance (P>0.017). Mean number of FPs was significantly different among algorithms (FBP, 1.4; ASIR, 2.1; MBIR, 2.4) (P=0.011)., CONCLUSION: Although the performance of stand-alone CAD for ULD CTC can be improved, IR algorithms, particularly MBIR, were shown to significantly increase the per-polyp sensitivity of CAD compared to FBP according to this study. Therefore, as ULD CTC only requires 1.02mSv, specific optimization of CAD for ULD CTC and IR algorithms is strongly warranted to make ULD CTC with CAD clinically viable.

4166,"Anatomical and functional changes in the upper airways of sleep apnea patients due to mandibular repositioning: A large scale study The obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep related breathing disorder. A popular treatment is the use of a mandibular repositioning appliance (MRA) which advances the mandibula during the sleep and decreases the collapsibility of the upper airway. The success rate of such a device is, however, limited and very variable within a population of patients. Previous studies using computational fluid dynamics have shown that there is a decrease in upper airway resistance in patients who improve clinically due to an MRA. In this article, correlations between patient-specific anatomical and functional parameters are studied to examine how MRA induced biomechanical changes will have an impact on the upper airway resistance. Low-dose computed tomography (CT) scans are made from 143 patients suffering from OSAHS. A baseline scan and a scan after mandibular repositioning (MR) are performed in order to study variations in parameters. It is found that MR using a simulation bite is able to induce resistance changes by changing the pharyngeal lumen. The change in minimal cross-sectional area is the best parameter to predict the change in upper airway resistance. Looking at baseline values, the ideal patients for MR induced resistance decrease seem to be women with short airways, high initial resistance and no baseline occlusion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Excluded
4042,"Evaluation of S100B in the diagnosis of suspected intracranial hemorrhage after minor head injury in patients who are receiving platelet aggregation inhibitors and in patients 65 years of age and older OBJECT: Cranial CT (CCT) scans and hospital admission are increasingly performed to rule out intracranial hemorrhage in patients after minor head injury (MHI), particularly in older patients and in those receiving antiplatelet therapy. This leads to high radiation exposure and a growing financial burden. The aim of this study was to determine whether the astroglial-derived protein S100B that is released into blood can be used as a reliable negative predictive tool for intracranial bleeding in patients after MHI, when they are older than 65 years or being treated with antiplatelet drugs (low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel)., METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational study in 2 trauma hospitals. A total of 782 patients with MHI (Glasgow Coma Scale Score 13-15) who were on medication with platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) or were age 65 years and older, independent of antiplatelet therapy, were included. Clinical examination, bloodwork, observation, and CCT were performed in the traumatology emergency departments. When necessary, patients were admitted and observation took place on the ward; in these patients, CCT was performed during their hospital stay. Patients with severe trauma, focal neurological deficits, posttraumatic seizures, anticoagulant therapy, alcohol intoxication, coagulation disorder, blood sampling more than 3 hours after trauma, and unknown time of the trauma were excluded from the study. The median age of the patients was 83 years, and 69% were female. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of S100B with reference to CCT findings were calculated. The cutoff of S100B was set at 0.105 mug/L., RESULTS: Of the 782 patients, 50 (6.4%) had intracranial bleeding. One patient with positive results on CCT scan showed an S100B level below 0.105 mug/L. Of all patients, 33.1% were below the cutoff. S100B showed a sensitivity of 98.0% (CI 89.5%-99.7%), a negative predictive value of 99.6% (CI 97.9%-99.9%), a specificity of 35.3% (CI 31.9%- 38.8%), and a positive predictive value of 9.4% (CI 7.2%-12.2%)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of S100B below 0.105 mug/L can accurately predict normal CCT findings after MHI in older patients and in those treated with PAIs. Combining conventional decision criteria with measurement of S100B can reduce the CCT scan and hospital admission rates by approximately 30%.",Excluded
3557,"Residential radon and lung cancer in Sweden: risk analysis accounting for random error in the exposure assessment A large epidemiologic study on residential radon exposure and lung cancer has been conducted in Sweden. An attempt is now made to quantify the impact of random error in the exposure assessment on the risk estimate for lung cancer in this study. The study included 1,360 lung cancer cases, diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and 2,847 population controls. Radon measurements were performed in 8,992 dwellings occupied by the study subjects some time since 1947. Questionnaires provided information on smoking and other risk factors. Imprecision in the retrospective exposure assessment for radon was estimated from a Monte Carlo technique modeling Swedish conditions. Adjusted risk estimates were obtained from regression analyses based on expected values for true time-weighted average residential radon concentration (TWA), conditional on observed TWA. Without adjustment for random error in the TWA estimates, the linear excess relative risk coefficient was 0.10 per 100 Bq m(-3), but an excess relative risk of about 0.15 to 0.20 per 100 Bq m(-3) was suggested following adjustment. The potentially significant consequences of errors in the retrospective radon exposure assessment should be taken into consideration in the risk estimation as well as in comparisons of results of different studies and in future pooled analyses.",Excluded
3843,"First-arterial-pass dual-energy CT for assessment of myocardial blood supply: Do we need rest, stress, and delayed acquisition? Comparison with SPECT Purpose: To compare the relative contributions of rest, stress, and delayed acquisitions with the accuracy of dual-energy (DE) computed tomography (CT) for the assessment of myocardial blood supply. Material(s) and Method(s): With institutional review board approval and HIPAA compliance, 55 consecutive patients (10 women, 45 men; mean age, 62 years 6 10) clinically referred for cardiac single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) who were known to have or were suspected of having coronary artery disease were prospectively enrolled. DE CT studies were acquired during adenosine stress, at rest, and after 6-minute delay. The DE CT iodine distribution maps were visually assessed for perfusion deficits or late iodine enhancement. Per-segment agreement between modalities was investigated with k statistics. Test characteristics for the detection of perfusion deficits were calculated for combinations of rest, stress, and delayed DE CT acquisition, with SPECT as reference standard. Result(s): At SPECT, 714 segments were considered normal, 192 showed fixed perfusion defects, and 29 showed reversible perfusion deficits. Sensitivity of rest-only DE CT was 92%, and specificity was 98%. Stress-only, rest-stress, stress and delayed, and the combination of all three had a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 97%. Of 29 segments with reversible perfusion deficits at SPECT, 13 (45%) were misclassified by using rest-stress DE CT as fixed perfusion deficits. With stress DE CT plus delayed acquisition, 13 of 192 (7%) segments with fixed perfusion deficits at SPECT were misclassified as reversible. Conclusion(s): Rest-stress acquisition should be the protocol of choice for assessment of the myocardial blood supply in DE CT. The accuracy of DE CT is not increased by the addition of a delayed DE CT acquisition, which may therefore be omitted to reduce radiation exposure. With rest-stress DE CT, almost one-half of defects that are reversible at SPECT were classified as fixed; radiologists and clinicians need to be aware of this incongruence when they interpret DE CT myocardial perfusion studies. © 2014 RSNA.",Excluded
3772,"Loss of Egr1, a human del5q gene, accelerates BCR-ABL driven chronic myelogenous leukemia There is substantial evidence that early growth response-1 (Egr1) gene, a zincfinger transcription factor, behaves as a tumor suppressor in leukemia. This includes reports from this laboratory that constitutive Egr1 overrides leukemia conferred by deregulated c-Myc or E2F-1 in the M1 myeloid leukemic cell line by promoting differentiation. To investigate the effect of Egr1 on the initiation and progression of Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), lethally irradiated syngeneic wild type mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) from either wild type or Egr1 null mice transduced with a 210-kD BCR-ABL-expressing MSCV-retrovirus (bone marrow transplantation (BMT)). Loss of Egr1 was observed to accelerate the development of BCR-ABL driven leukemia in recipient mice, resulting in the development of a more aggressive disease, a significantly shortened median survival time, and increased BCR-ABL expressing leukemic stem/progenitor cells (GFP+Lin-cKit+Sca+). Egr1 deficient progenitors expressing BCR-ABL exhibited decreased apoptosis, and increased cell viability and proliferation relative to WT counterparts. Secondary BMT of BCR-ABL BM revealed that loss of Egr1 resulted in enrichment of LSCs, consistent with shorter survival time and more aggressive disease of these mice compared to WT counterparts. Furthermore, serial re-plating colony assays indicated that loss of Egr1 increased self-renewal ability of BCR-ABL expressing BM. These novel findings on the tumor suppressor role of Egr1 in CML provide the impetus to study the effect of altering Egr1 expression in AML, where the overall five year survival rate remains low. The effect of loss of Egr1 in CML could reflect its established functions in normal hematopoiesis, maintaining quiescence of HSCs and driving terminal differentiation to the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Gain of function studies should validate these conclusions and provide further rationale for increased Egr1 as a therapeutic target in AML.Copyright © Maifrede et al.",Excluded
4495,"Manual adjustment of tube voltage from 120 to 100 kVp during abdominal CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg: assessment of image quality and radiation dose in a prospective, randomised trial AIM: To assess image quality and radiation dose in patients with body weights <=75 kg undergoing abdominal computed tomography (CT) with a tube voltage of either 120 or 100 kVp., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty patients weighing <=75 kg were prospectively assigned to receive either 120 or 100 kVp abdominal CT in the portal-venous phase. Attenuation values of abdominal organs and image noise were measured, and the contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated. Subjective image quality was assessed by three independent radiologists. Radiation exposure was assessed by size-specific dose estimate (SSDE)., RESULTS: The mean attenuation of the kidney increased by 20% at 100 kVp (p<0.0001), and the mean image noise was 27% higher in the 100 kVp (p=0.003). The CNR did not significantly differ between the groups (120 kVp, 6.6+/-2.8; 100 kVp, 7.4+/-3.6; p=0.26). Except for subjective image noise (p<0.001), no other subjective quality parameters (e.g., contrast, artefacts) were significantly different between the two groups (p between 0.094 and 0.761). The mean SSDE in the 100-kVp group (9.8+/-1.8 mGy) was reduced by 19% compared to the 120-kVp group (12.1+/-1.8 mGy; p<0.0001)., CONCLUSION: Manual reduction of tube voltage from the standard 120 to 100 kVp for portal-venous phase CT in patients with body weights <=75 kg resulted in a 19% dose reduction while maintaining objective and subjective image quality.

4031,"Ultra-low-dose computed tomography and its utility in wrist trauma in the emergency department Background: The use and frequency of computed tomography (CT) are increasing day by day in emergency departments (ED). This increases the amount of radiation exposed. Purpose(s): To evaluate the image quality obtained by ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) in patients with suspected wrist fractures in the ED and to investigate whether it is an alternative to standard-dose CT (SDCT). Material(s) and Method(s): This is a study prospectively examining 336 patients who consulted the ED for wrist trauma. After exclusion criteria were applied, the patients were divided into the study and control groups. Then, SDCT (120 kVp and 100 mAs) and ULDCT (80 kVp and 5 mAs) wrist protocols were applied simultaneously. The images obtained were evaluated for image quality and fracture independently by a radiologist and an emergency medical specialist using a 5-point scale. Result(s): The effective radiation dose calculated for the control group scans was 41.1 +/- 2.1 microSv, whereas the effective radiation dose calculated for the study group scans was 0.5 +/- 0.0 microSv. The effective radiation dose of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.01). The CT images in the study group showed no significant differences in the mean image quality score between observer 1 and observer 2 (3.4 and 4.3, respectively; P = 0.58). Both observers could detect all fractures using the ULDCT images. Conclusion(s): ULDCT provides high-quality images in wrist traumas while reducing the radiation dose by approximately 98% compared to SDCT without any changes in diagnostic accuracy.Copyright © The Foundation Acta Radiologica 2021.",Excluded
4385,"Long-term results of concurrent chemoradiotherapy for T3/T4 locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed head and neck malignancies. This study investigated the outcome of locally advanced NPC patients on concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF). A total of 226 patients with locally advanced NPC received IMRT, with a total dose of 65-70 Gy and concurrent chemotherapy, with 2 cycles of TPF administered during radiotherapy, between March, 2005 and March, 2007. An additional 2 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy were administered every 21 days following radiotherapy. With a median follow-up time of 35 months (range, 7-60), the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 81.4%, with 93.6 and 75.0% for T3 and T4 lesions, respectively, (P=0.001). The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 50.4%, with 66.7 and 46.9% for T3 and T4 lesions, respectively (P<0.001). T-classification was a significant prognostic factor for PFS and OS. The subgroup analysis revealed that pterygopalatine fossa invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.002), foramen rotundum invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P<0.001) and OS (P=0.004), foramen ovale invasion was associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P=0.013) and OS (P=0.024) and foramen lacerum and cavernous sinus invasion were associated with a significantly lower 5-year PFS (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an advocated regimen for patients with locally advanced NPC, since it exhibits satisfactory 5-year PFS and OS rates. Our results suggest that the estimation of invasive range may identify a subgroup of patients with a higher risk of locoregional failure who may be better candidates for this treatment strategy.",Excluded

3938,"The Relationship between Media Consumption and Health-Related Anxieties after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster Background:The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster caused a global panic by a release of harmful radionuclides. In a disaster setting, misusage of contemporary media sources available today can lead to disseminated incorrect information and panic. The study aims to build a scale which examines associations between media and individual anxieties, and to propose effective media usages for future disaster management. Method(s):The University of Tokyo collaborated with the Fukushima local government to conduct a radiation-health-seminar for a total of 1560 residents, at 12 different locations in Fukushima. A 13 item questionnaire collected once before and after a radiation-seminar was used on factor analysis to develop sub-scales for multiple regression models, to determine relationships between the sub-scales and media type consumed. A paired t-test was used to examine any changes in sub-scale of pre- and post-seminar scores. Result(s):Three sub-scales were revealed and were associated with different media types: was with rumors, while concern for the future was positively associated with regional-newspapers and negatively with national-newspapers. Anxiety about social-disruption was associated with radio. The seminar had a significant effect on anxiety reduction for all the three sub-scales. Conclusion(s):Different media types were associated with various heightened concerns, and that a radiation seminar was helpful to reduce anxieties in the post-disaster setting. By tailoring post-disaster messages via specific media types, i.e., radio, it may be possible to effectively convey important information, as well as to calm fears about particular elements of post-disaster recovery and to combat rumors. © 2013 Sugimoto et al.",Excluded
4347,"Intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a rhenium-188 filled balloon catheter in restenotic lesions of native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts Purpose: We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in a randomised trial including de novo lesions. Percutaneous coronary interventions in restenotic lesions and in stenoses of venous bypass grafts are characterised by a high recurrence rate for restenosis and re-interventions. Against this background, we wanted to assess the impact of intracoronary beta-brachytherapy using a liquid 188Re-filled balloon in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries and venous bypass grafts. Method(s): In 243 patients, beta-brachytherapy with 22.5 Gy was applied at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm. Patients were followed up angiographically after 6 months and clinically for 12 months. The primary clinical endpoint was the incidence of MACE (death, myocardial infarction, target vessel revascularisation). Secondary angiographic endpoints were late loss and binary restenosis rate in the total segment. Result(s): All irradiation procedures were successfully performed. A total of 222 lesions were in native coronary arteries; 21 were bypass lesions. Mean irradiation length was 41.6+/-17.3 mm (range 20-150 mm) in native coronary arteries and 48.1+/-33.9 mm (range 30-180 mm) in bypass lesions; the reference diameter was 2.57+/-0.52 mm and 2.83+/-0.76 mm, respectively. There was no vessel thrombosis during antiplatelet therapy. Angiographic/clinical follow-up rate was 84%/100%. MACE rate was 17.6% in the native coronary artery group and 38.1% in the CABG group (p<0.03). Binary restenosis rate was 22.5% and 55.6% (p<0.01), and late loss was 0.38+/-0.72 mm and 1.33+/-1.11 mm (p<0.001), respectively. Conclusion(s): We conclude that intracoronary beta-brachytherapy with a liquid 188Re-filled balloon using 22.5 Gy at a tissue depth of 0.5 mm in restenotic lesions is safe. It is associated with a low binary restenosis rate, resulting in a low occurrence rate of MACE within 12 months in restenotic lesions in native coronary arteries but not in vein grafts. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",Excluded

To evaluate the efficiency of DVT in comparison with OPG in the assessment of bony condylar changes in patients of TMJ pain. Methods. 100 temporomandibular joints of 62 patients with the complaint of temporomandibular joint pain were included in the study. DVT and OPG radiographs were taken for all the 100 joints. Three observers interpreted the DVT and OPG radiograph for the bony changes separately for two times with an interval of one week. The bony changes seen in the condyle were given coding from 0 to 6. (0: Normal, 1: Erosion, 2: Flattening, 3: Osteophyte, 4: Sclerosis, 5: Resorption, and 6: other changes). Interobserver and intraobserver variability was assessed with one-way ANOVA statistics. Z test was used to see the significant difference between OPG and DVT. Results . In the present study the interexaminer reliability for OPG and DVT was 0.903 and 0.978, respectively. Intraexaminer reliability for OPG and DVT was 0.908 and 0.980, respectively. The most common condylar bony change seen in OPG and DVT was erosion followed by flattening and osteophyte. There was significant difference between OPG and DVT in detecting erosion and osteophytes. The other changes observed in our study were Ely's cyst, pointed condyle, and bifid condyle. All the bony changes are more commonly seen in females than males. Conclusion . DVT provides more valid and accurate information on condylar bony changes. The DVT has an added advantage of lesser radiation exposure to the patient and cost effectiveness and could be easily accessible in a dental hospital.",Excluded
3791,"Evaluation of hospital room assignment and acquisition of Clostridium difficile infection BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE. Clostridium difficile spores persist in hospital environments for an extended period. We evaluated whether admission to a room previously occupied by a patient with C. difficile infection (CDI) increased the risk of acquiring CDI. DESIGN. Retrospective cohort study. SETTING. Medical intensive care unit (ICU) at a tertiary care hospital. METHODS. Patients admitted from January 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, were evaluated for a diagnosis of CDI 48 hours after ICU admission and within 30 days after ICU discharge. Medical, ICU, and pharmacy records were reviewed for other CDI risk factors. Admitted patients who did develop CDI were compared with admitted patients who did not. RESULTS. Among 1,844 patients admitted to the ICU, 134 CDI cases were identified. After exclusions, 1,770 admitted patients remained for analysis. Of the patients who acquired CDI after admission to the ICU, 4.6% had a prior occupant without CDI, whereas 11.0% had a prior occupant with CDI (P=.002 ). The effect of room on CDI acquisition remained a significant risk factor (P=.008) when Kaplan-Meier curves were used. The prior occupant's CDI status remained significant (P=.01; hazard ratio, 2.35) when controlling for the current patient's age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score, exposure to proton pump inhibitors, and antibiotic use. CONCLUSIONS. A prior room occupant with CDI is a significant risk factor for CDI acquisition, independent of established CDI risk factors. These findings have implications for room placement and hospital design. © 2011 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. All rights reserved.",Excluded
3571,"A comparison of dose and set-up accuracy between flexed and extended neck positions in Helical Tomotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with Helical Tomotherapy (HT) are commonly set up in an extended neck (EN) or a flexed neck (FN) position. This study investigated the dosimetric and set-up accuracy differences between these 2 set-up positions. Twenty NPC patients treated with HT from each set-up position were retrospectively recruited. HT plans were computed using the same target prescription and organs at risks (OARs) constraints for both set-up positions. The doses parameters of the target volumes and OARs were assessed. Daily megavoltage CT images were retrieved to obtain the set-up errors at 4th (C4) and 7th (C7) cervical levels. The mean values of these parameters were compared between the 2 set-up positions. The dose to NP target in FN group was more conformal than EN group, while the conformity of the neck targets in FN group were significantly lower. For the OARs, the temporal lobe, cerebellum, and hippocampus in FN group received significantly lower doses than the EN. However, the optic structures, brain stem, spinal cord, and parotid glands received higher doses in FN group. The systematic errors at C4 and C7 levels in FN group were larger in all translational directions except the ML direction at C7 level. With regard to radiotherapy of NPC patient using helical tomotherapy, FN position reduced doses to intracranial structures but increased doses to optic structures and other structures when compared with the EN position. In terms of set-up accuracy at the neck region, EN position was relatively better.Copyright © 2020 American Association of Medical Dosimetrists",Excluded

Between March 2008 and August 2009, 10 patients were treated with SRT boost using CyberKnife system due mainly to unfavorable condition such as tumors in close proximity to serial organs or former radiotherapy fields. Treatment sites were the external auditory canal in two, the nasopharynx in one, the oropharynx in three, the nasal cavity in one, the maxillary sinus in two, and the oligometastatic cervical lymph node in one. All patients underwent preceding conventional radiotherapy of 40 to 60 Gy. Dose and fractionation scheme of the Cyberknife SRT boost was individualized, and prescribed dose ranged from 9 Gy to 16 Gy in 3 to 4 fractions. Among four patients for whom dose to the optic pathway was concerned, the maximum dose was only about 3 Gy for three patients whereas 9.6 Gy in the remaining one patient. The maximum dose for the mandible in one of three patients with oropharyngeal cancer was 19.7 Gy, whereas majority of the bone can be spared by using non-isocentric conformal beams. For a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer, the highest dose in the brain stem was 15 Gy. However, majority of the brain stem received less than 40% of the maximum dose.

3702,"Quantitative Accuracy and Lesion Detectability of Low-Dose 18F-FDG PET for Lung Cancer Screening Lung cancer remains responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other cancer, but recently there has been a significant shift in the clinical paradigm regarding the initial management of subjects at high risk for this disease. Low-dose CT has demonstrated significant improvements over planar x-ray screening for patient prognoses and is now performed in the United States. Specificity of this modality, however, is poor, and the additional information from PET has the potential to improve its accuracy. Routine screening requires consideration of the effective dose delivered to the patient, and this work investigates image quality of PET for low-dose conditions, in the context of lung lesion detectability. Reduced radiotracer doses were simulated by randomly discarding counts from clinical lung cancer scans acquired in list-mode. Bias and reproducibility of lesion activity values were relatively stable even at low total counts of around 5 million trues. Additionally, numeric observer models were developed and trained with the results of 2 physicians and 3 postdoctoral researchers with PET experience in a detection task; detection sensitivity of the observers was well correlated with lesion signal-to-noise ratio. The models were used prospectively to survey detectability of lung cancer lesions, and the findings suggested a lower limit around 10 million true counts for maximizing performance. Under the acquisition parameters used in this study, this translates to an effective patient dose of less than 0.4 mSv, potentially allowing a complete low-dose PET/CT lung screening scan to be obtained under 1 mSv.
