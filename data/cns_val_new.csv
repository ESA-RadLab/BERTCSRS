OBJECTIVES: Anatomical information middle inner ear becoming increasingly important post-operative evaluation especially stapesplasty unsuccessful improvement air-bone gap (ABG). So far computed tomography (CT) first choice detection reasons recurrent hearing loss. CT disadvantage metal-induced artefacts insertion middle ear implants relatively high irradiation dose. METHODS: Flat panel CT (fpCT) performed three temporal bone specimen experimental insertion different stapes prostheses, aiming validate accuracy fpCT middle inner ear. Additionally,  consecutive patients, supplied different stapes prostheses underwent post-operative fpCT compare pre- post-operative hearing determined prosthesis position middle inner ear. RESULTS: In cases, fpCT showed statistically significant correlation hearing improvement prosthesis position. This technique provided detailed post-operative information implant position patients temporal bone specimen. CONCLUSIONS: The new imaging technique fpCT allows immediate almost artefact-free evaluation surgical following stapesplasty.

BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced optic neuropathy (RON) form delayed radionecrosis anterior visual pathways, develops within months years external cranial irradiation causes severe irreversible vision loss. Small series reports adequately documented clinical features, imaging characteristics less completely described. METHODS: We accrued cases University Michigan Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinic files cases coded [']radiation optic neuropathy['] University Michigan Medical Center  . All patients undergone D-conformal linear accelerator (photon) external beam radiation. We collected clinical details vision loss, including temporal relationship radiation. A single neuroradiologist (E.A.L.) evaluated available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, noting presence enhancement, expansion, volume loss optic nerves chiasm, corresponding T signal abnormalities, absence demyelination confounding compressive lesions. RESULTS: Twelve patients ( eyes) met inclusion criteria. Vision loss usually monocular outset, optic nerves eventually involved  (%) patients. Although usually sudden onset, vision loss often declined slowly many months, frequently finger counting, worse without recovery. An afferent pupillary defect always present time presentation. Most affected optic discs pale time first visual symptoms, indicating subclinical optic nerve damage present several weeks.

OBJECT Systemic control metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) substantially improved development VEGF, mTOR, checkpoint inhibitors. The current first-line standard care VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate response radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong time salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy second-line systemic therapy. As prevalence mRCC increased, utilization spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment SRS TKIs remain largely undefined. The investigation determine safety efficacy TKIs delivered concurrently SRS. The authors hypothesized first-line TKIs delivered concurrently SRS significantly increase local control compared SRS alone TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study patients undergoing spine SRS mRCC conducted. Patients undergoing SRS divided  cohorts: receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), patients undergoing SRS (C) without (D) concurrent TKI treatment failure first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) also included, consisting patients spinal metastases managed TKIs alone. The primary outcome -month local failure, defined in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression used determine independent effect concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure.

Moreover, medical studies scientific research indicated consumption molecular hydrogen specifically hydrogen water provide better quality live people many circumstances instance case patients treated radiation cancerous cells. The FDA recently issued notice molecular hydrogen generally regarded safe formulated beverages. Reactive oxygen species free radicals one major offenders render oxidative damage biological macromolecules. The non-toxicity high concentrations rapid cellular diffusion features molecular hydrogen ensure feasibility readiness clinical translation human patients. Hydrogen water concentration . mg/L would 'antioxidant' molecules  mg vitamin C, total molecules . mg hydrogen compared  mg vitamin C. Reduced water produced electrolysis tap water higher pH (.-.), lower oxidation reduction potential, lower dissolved oxygen higher dissolved hydrogen non-electrolyzed water. Conclusion(s): Many studies required improve capabilities technical difficulties preparing high concentration hydrogen water patients optimisation modalities treatment taking account difference acute chronic diseases. Further large-scale long-term clinical studies expected demonstrate clearly effects hydrogen humans."

The work evaluate dosimetric uncertainties analytical dose calculation engine impact treatment plans using small fields intracranial proton stereotactic radiosurgery (PSRS) gantry based double scattering system.  patients evaluated including  patients  diagnostic indications of: arteriovenous malformation (AVM), acoustic neuroma (AN), meningioma (MGM), metastasis (METS), pituitary adenoma (PIT). Treatment plans followed standard prescription optimization procedures PSRS. We performed comparisons delivered dose distributions, determined Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, calculated analytical dose calculation algorithm (ADC) used current treatment planning system terms dose volume histogram parameters beam range distributions. Results show difference dose % target (D) within % applying measured field size output corrections AN, MGM, PIT. However, AVM METS, differences great % %, respectively. Normalizing MC dose ADC dose based dose voxels central area target reduces difference D within % sites. The generally applied margin cover uncertainties range (.% prescribed range +  mm) sufficient cover range uncertainty ADC cases, especially patients high tissue heterogeneity. The root mean square R difference, difference position distal falloff % prescribed dose, affected several factors, especially patient geometry heterogeneity, modulation field diameter. In conclusion, implementation Monte Carlo dose calculation techniques clinic reduce uncertainty target dose proton stereotactic radiosurgery. If MC available treatment planning, using MC dose distributions adjust delivered doses level also reduce uncertainties % mean target dose % D."
