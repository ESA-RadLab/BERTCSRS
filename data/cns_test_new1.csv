Background Patients acute non-traumatic abdominal pain often undergo abdominal computed tomography (CT). However, abdominal CT associated high radiation exposure. Purpose To evaluate diagnostic performance reduced-dose  kVp CT protocol advanced modeled iterative reconstruction compared linearly blended  kVp protocol assessment acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain. Material Methods Two radiologists assessed  kVp linearly blended  kVp series  consecutive patients acute non-traumatic pain (onset <  h) regarding image quality, noise, artifacts five-point Likert scale. Both radiologists assessed series abdominal pathologies diagnostic confidence. Both  kVp linearly blended  kVp series quantitatively evaluated regarding radiation dose image noise. Comparative statistics diagnostic accuracy calculated using receiver operating curve (ROC) statistics, final clinical diagnosis/clinical follow-up reference standard. Results Image quality high series without detectable significant differences ( P = .). Image noise artifacts rated low series significantly higher  kVp ( P <= .). Diagnostic accuracy high series ( kVp: area curve [AUC] = ., sensitivity = ., specificity = .;  kVp: AUC >= ., sensitivity >= ., specificity = .; P >= .) almost perfect inter-rater agreement (Kappa = .).

METHODS: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received intense light exposures varied durations survival times ranging   days. Remodeling visualized computational molecular phenotyping (CMP) small molecule library: -aminobutyrate (gamma), arginine (R), aspartate (D), glutamate (E), glutamine (Q), glutathione (J), glycine (G), taurine (tau). This library augmented probes key proteins rod opsin, cone opsin cellular retinal binding protein (CRALBP). Quantitative CMP used profile  eyes  animals , sections. RESULTS: The onset remodeling LIRD retinas rapid, immediate signs metabolic stress photoreceptors, retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), choriocapillaris, Muller cells. In particular, anomalous elevated aspartate levels appear early stress marker photoreceptors. After stress phase, LIRD progresses focal photoreceptor degeneration within  days extensive remodeling  days.

Materials: In conventional radiation therapy moving tumours, motion encompassing margin normally added clinical target volume (CTV) ensure tumour receives planned treatment dose. This substantial increase dose surrounding healthy tissue OARs. Our D-VMAT algorithm aims reduce OAR dose fully incorporating voxel voxel priori knowledge D target OAR motion directly optimization process. During optimization, phase correlated beam samples progressively added throughout full range gantry rotation. The resulting treatment plans respiratory phase-optimized apertures whose deliveries synchronized patient's respiratory cycle. D-VMAT plans reduce dose OAR by: () eliminating motion margin () selectively redistributing OAR dose OAR volume () timing larger dose contributions (MU) respiratory phases greater separations target OAR occur.Our D-VMAT algorithm tested simulating variety tumour motion amplitudes (.- cm) cranial/caudal anterior/posterior directions. D-VMAT's performance compared D-VMAT, gated VMAT dynamic MLC tracking VMAT. Result(s): Results show OAR sparing D-VMAT greater D- VMAT cases due smaller PTV margin. Compared dynamic MLC tracking VMAT, D-VMAT's OAR sparing superior relative distance PTV OAR changing. For gated VMAT, compared D-VMAT phantom dependent. There negligible difference plan qualities tested case motion anterior/posterior axis. For motions cranial/caudal axis, gated VMAT's narrow beam- window reduces irradiated OAR volume also allow hotspots accumulate. In contrast, D-VMAT reduce hotspots cost redistributing OAR dose larger volume. Finally D-VMAT, increase tumour motion longer resulted greater irradiation OAR seen conventional D radiation therapy. OAR dose levels preserved increasing target motion along anterior/posterior axis. For increasing cranial/caudal motion, volume OAR exposed high doses actually decreased due dose redistribution. Conclusion(s): Our investigation demonstrated D-VMAT system potential improve radiation therapy periodically moving tumours gating tracking methods."

OBJECTIVE: To obtain high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) image low-dose tracer injection, study attempts predict standard-dose PET (S-PET) image low-dose PET (L-PET) counterpart corresponding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: It achieved patch-based sparse representation (SR), using training samples complete set MRI, L-PET S-PET modalities dictionary construction. However, number training samples complete modalities often limited. In practice, many samples generally incomplete modalities (i.e., one two missing modalities) thus cannot used prediction process.

TECHNIQUE: Diagnostic lumbar medial branch blocks usually performed using multiple needles, one branch. The authors describe different technique using single needle levels. Initially, needle directed toward medial branch located level affected facet joint antero-posterior view. After anesthetizing nerve local anesthetic, needle withdrawn skin tip still subcutaneous tissue repositioned block medial branch above, thereafter below, continuing use antero-posterior view, thereby using one entry site. CONCLUSIONS: When performed correctly, single needle technique provides accuracy similar conventional multiple needle approach performance diagnostic facet joint nerve blocks.

In order avoid drawbacks, adaptive therapy planned patients risk, prediction obtained timely, early phase treatment. Artificial intelligence address problem, learning examples building classification models. In particular, fuzzy logic shown suitability medical applications, order manage uncertain data, build transparent rule-based classifiers. In previous works, clinical, dosimetric image-based features considered separately, find different possible predictors parotid shrinkage. On hand, works reported possible image-based predictors xerostomia, combination different types features little addressed. OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes application novel machine learning approach, based statistics fuzzy logic, aimed classification patients risk i) parotid gland shrinkage ii) -months xerostomia. Both problems addressed aim individuating predictors models classify respective outcomes. METHODS: Knowledge extracted real dataset radiotherapy patients, means recently developed method named Likelihood-Fuzzy Analysis, based representation statistical information fuzzy rule-based models. This method enables manage heterogeneous variables missing data, obtain interpretable fuzzy models presenting good generalization power (thus high performance), measure classification confidence. Numerous features extracted characterize patients, coming different sources, i.e. clinical features, dosimetric parameters, radiomics-based obtained texture analysis Computed Tomography images.
