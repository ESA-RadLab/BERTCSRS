Large-scale multi-electrode recordings  macaque retinas revealed cells exhibit irregular receptive field structure composed spatially segregated hotspots, quite different classic center-surround model retinal receptive fields. Surprisingly, visual stimulation different hotspots cell produced spikes subtly different spatiotemporal voltage signatures, consistent dendritic contribution hotspot structure. Targeted visual stimulation computational inference demonstrated strong nonlinear subunit properties associated hotspot, supporting model hotspots apply nonlinearities larger spatial scale bipolar cells. These findings reveal previously unreported nonlinear mechanism output primate retina contributes signaling spatial information."

654,654,Melatonin: A Potential Anti-Oxidant Therapeutic Agent Mitochondrial Dysfunctions Related Disorders,"Mitochondria play central role cellular physiology. Besides classic function energy metabolism, mitochondria involved multiple cell functions, including energy distribution cell, energy/heat modulation, regulation reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium homeostasis, control apoptosis. Simultaneously, mitochondria main producer target ROS result multiple mitochondrial diseases related ROS-induced mitochondrial injuries. Increased free radical generation, enhanced mitochondrial inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity, enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production, decreased respiratory complex activity, impaired electron transport system, opening mitochondrial permeability transition pores suggested factors responsible impaired mitochondrial function. Because these, neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), aging, caused ROS-induced mitochondrial dysfunctions.

The proposed workflow implemented graphical processing units perform warping pre-operatively parcellated optic radiation intra-operative space  min making proposed algorithm suitable use stringent time constraints neurosurgical procedures. The method validated using numerical phantom clinical data using pre- post-operative images patients undergone surgery treatment refractory focal epilepsy shows strong correlation observed post-operative visual field deficit predicted damage optic radiation. We also validate algorithm using interventional MRI datasets small cohort patients. This work could significant utility image guided interventions facilitate effective surgical treatments.

The current first-line standard care VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate response radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong time salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy second-line systemic therapy. As prevalence mRCC increased, utilization spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment SRS TKIs remain largely undefined. The investigation determine safety efficacy TKIs delivered concurrently SRS. The authors hypothesized first-line TKIs delivered concurrently SRS significantly increase local control compared SRS alone TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study patients undergoing spine SRS mRCC conducted. Patients undergoing SRS divided  cohorts: receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), patients undergoing SRS (C) without (D) concurrent TKI treatment failure first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) also included, consisting patients spinal metastases managed TKIs alone. The primary outcome -month local failure, defined in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression used determine independent effect concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients underwent  spine SRS treatments ( vertebral levels) included. At time SRS, % receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In SRS cohort, median prescription dose  Gy  fraction. Patients Cohort A highest burden epidural disease (%, p < .). At  months, cumulative incidence local failure % Cohort A, compared %-% Cohorts B-D % Cohort E (p < .).

The current first-line standard care VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). In preclinical models, TKIs potentiate response radiotherapy. Such improved efficacy may prolong time salvage therapies, including whole-brain radiotherapy second-line systemic therapy. As prevalence mRCC increased, utilization spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) also increased. However, clinical outcomes following concurrent treatment SRS TKIs remain largely undefined. The investigation determine safety efficacy TKIs delivered concurrently SRS. The authors hypothesized first-line TKIs delivered concurrently SRS significantly increase local control compared SRS alone TKIs alone, without increased toxicity. METHODS A retrospective cohort study patients undergoing spine SRS mRCC conducted. Patients undergoing SRS divided  cohorts: receiving concurrent first-line TKI therapy (A), systemic therapy-naive patients (B), patients undergoing SRS (C) without (D) concurrent TKI treatment failure first-line therapy. A negative control cohort (E) also included, consisting patients spinal metastases managed TKIs alone. The primary outcome -month local failure, defined in-field radiographic progression. Multivariate competing risks regression used determine independent effect concurrent first-line TKI therapy upon local failure. RESULTS One hundred patients underwent  spine SRS treatments ( vertebral levels) included. At time SRS, % receiving concurrent TKI therapy. In SRS cohort, median prescription dose  Gy  fraction. Patients Cohort A highest burden epidural disease (%, p < .). At  months, cumulative incidence local failure % Cohort A, compared %-% Cohorts B-D % Cohort E (p < .). Multivariate competing risks regression demonstrated concurrent first-line TKI treatment (Cohort A) independently associated local control benefit (HR ., p = .). In contrast, patients treated TKIs alone (Cohort E) experienced increased rate local failure (HR ., p = .). No toxicities Grade  greater occurred following SRS concurrent TKI treatment, incidence post-SRS vertebral fracture (overall %) pain flare (overall %) similar across cohorts. CONCLUSIONS The prognosis patients mRCC significantly improved TKIs. The present investigation suggests local control benefit addition concurrent first-line TKI therapy spine SRS.

In last decade, survivin, inhibitor apoptosis proteins (IAP) family, shown promising target, selectively expressed tumors expression correlates grade malignancy therapy response. Besides anti-apoptotic factor, survivin plays role chromosome segregation mitosis. It passively penetrates nucleus actively exported nucleus C-terminal nuclear export sequence (NES). Since nuclear accumulation survivin observed upon exposure ionizing radiation, survivin seems support DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, question arises whether also alkylation-induced DSBs impact survivin localization affects DNA repair, cell cycle, clastogenicity cellular survival. Method(s): DNA cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, transfection generation stable clones, immunofluorescence, colony-forming assays, flow cytometric cell death assays, western blot analysis, Co-IP/ interactome analysis, chromosomal aberration assays. Result(s): To answer questions, generated glioblastoma cell clones stably expressing either GFP-survivin NES-mutated GFP-survivin fusion protein (GFPNESmut-survivin).

The important mechanism TMZ resistance O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene repairs temozolamide-induced DNA methylation. The MGMT inhibitor O-benzylguanine (BG) demonstrated efficacy depleting MGMT maximizing tumor response early phase clinical trials. However, MGMT expression also low hematopoietic cells, resulted unacceptable bone marrow toxicity, approach abandoned. We hypothesized chemoprotection hematopoieticprogenitor cells (HPC) MGMT mutant (MGMT-PK) characterized normal methyltransferase activity coupled low affinity BG, would maximize anti-tumor response enabling patients tolerate TMZ & BG dose escalation minimal toxicity. We thus performed phase I trial test hypothesis. METHOD(S): We treated  consecutive patients newly diagnosed GBM standard surgery radiation, followed transplantation autologous CD+hematopoetic progenitor cells engineered express MGMT-PK using lentiviral vector three arms. To assess chemo-protection, patients' blood counts transgene marking monitored treatment tumor growth survival. RESULT(S): The viral transduction rates .-% clearly improved third arm intra-patient dose escalation. PK-MGMT gene markings peripheral blood bone marrow cells increased -- fold mild-moderate (Grade -) mylosuppression consistent chemo-selection chemo-protection hypothesized. Survival ranged - months exceeded RPA predicted survival .- . fold suggesting clinical benefit (mean .). Viral insertion site analysis failed demonstrate evidence clonal dominance. CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary result demonstrates chemoprotection strategy tolerable, safe, facilitates TMZ & BG dose escalation resulting increased survival small cohort selected patients.

Median survival  months patients received twice-daily radiotherapy ( Gy/ fractions/ weeks) versus  months daily treated patients ( Gy/ fractions/ weeks). The corresponding  years survival rates % %. However, Grade - oesophagitis seen twice-daily treatment (% versus %). Only minority patients US Europe receive twice daily radiotherapy. Recently CONVERT trial, once-daily radiotherapy (Gy) compared twice daily radiotherapy ( Gy) presented. Radiotherapy initiated nd course - cycles cisplatin/etoposide. There statistically significant difference overall survival two arms. Overall survival  years % patients treated twice-daily versus % patients treated once-daily (p= .). There also significant difference time progression. There differences acute toxicity, except Grade - neutropenia, occurred often twicedaily treatment arm (% versus %). There differences Grade - oesophagitis (%) pneumonitis (%). The authors concluded survival study arms higher reported previously radiation related toxicities lower expected, probably related use modern radiotherapy techniques. The study support use either twice daily daily standard care patients limited stage disease good performance score. In RTOG study, also compares  Gy once-daily  Gy twice-daily radiotherapy, radiotherapy commences first second course chemotherapy. The study eagerly awaited. Extensive stage: In EORTC study prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) ES-SCLC, noted vast majority patients still intrathoracic disease completion chemotherapy. After positive effects PCI reduced risk symptomatic brain metastases ( versus %) also improved overall survival ( year:  versus % (P= ,)), next logical step investigate use thoracic radiotherapy ES-SCLC well. Evidence possible role thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) ESSCLC also comes trial published Jeremic et al.  patients ES-SCLC good prognosis complete response outside thorax randomized TRT plus PCI chemotherapy versus chemotherapy PCI only. Overall survival  months patients received thoracic radiotherapy versus  months not. In CREST trial, patients ES-SCLC response - cycles platinum based chemotherapy randomized PCI plus TRT (Gy/ fractions) PCI only. Overall survival one year, primary endpoint study, statistically significant groups (p=.) longer follow survival curves diverged  years, survival % patients received TRT versus % controls (p=,). There also significant dif erence progression free survival. In additional analysis patients without residual intrathoracic disease, one stratification factors study, demonstrated significant benefit TRT patients CR thorax. However, patients residual intrathoracic disease chemotherapy, TRT led significant improvement overall survival.  In patients received thoracic radiotherapy risk intrathoracic recurrence reduced % %. In patients received thoracic radiotherapy recurrences occurred outside brain thorax later stage. The next logical step demonstration beneficial effect PCI TRT would use higher doses TRT possibly also treatment extrathoracic metastatic sites. This topic addressed NRG-RTOG study presented ASTRO . patients ES-SCLC CR PR chemotherapy - metastatic lesions randomized PCI PCI plus TRT plus radiotherapy metastatic sites. The study accrued slowly closed early due observed toxicities. The study show survival difference two groups, included  patients five years period imbalance groups worse prognostic factors experimental arm. There many, partly unrelated, Grade - toxicities experimental arm. To define patients likely benefit aggressive approach performed additional analysis patients top accruing centers CREST trial. An evaluation  patients showed significantly better outcome patients   metastases versus without liver metastases. These patients believed best candidates future studies."

Fractional anisotropy (FA) mean diffusivity (MD) assessed using atlas-based tract mapping  different fiber tracts. Result(s): CSFTT non-responders, compared responders, showed lower FA values left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) left cingulum-hippocampus (CgH). The associations clinical symptoms INPH DTI commonly found CgH. Higher MD CgH correlated poorer cognitive performance. Higher MD right CgH also correlated gait motor dysfunction. Lower FA right CgH correlated urinary disturbance cognitive impairment. Lower FA values corticospinal tract (CST) right ATR significantly correlated poorer cognitive performance, correlated gait dysfunction. Higher MD left CST correlated cognitive impairment. Conclusion(s): Our findings may suggest possibility considering microstructural changes white matter ventriculomegaly patients potential imaging markers prediction CSFTT responders.

Mice exposed two identical objects  hours later reintroduced one familiar object one novel object. Mice recognize familiar object spend time exploring novel object. The percent time exploring novel object total time exploring objects calculated determine object recognition. Following cognitive testing, brain tissue harvested used inflammatory cytokine chemokine -plex (GM-CSF, TNF-a, IL-, IL-b, IL-, MIG, KC, VEGF, IL-, MIP-a, IL-, IL-, IL-, IL-, FGF-Basic, IL-a, IFN-g, IL-, MCP-, IP-). Result(s): In animals receive tumors, object recognition seen control mice mice receiving either RT anti-CTLA- alone, mice receiving treatments. In mice receiving tumors, mice received RT alone showed novel object recognition. Conclusion(s): While combining immune activation RT optimizes tumor control, associated cognitive impairments. Data -plex currently analyzed. We determine levels cytokines chemokines might altered various treatments whether associated behavioral cognitive performance. These presented meeting."
