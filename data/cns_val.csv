Synaptic transmission sensory neuron-motor neuron synapses Aplysia, like transmission many synapses vertebrates invertebrates, increased short burst high-frequency stimulation (HFS), phenomenon known posttetanic potentiation (PTP). PTP generally attributable increase transmitter release presynaptic neurons. We investigated whether changes readily releasable pool transmitter (RRP) contribute potentiation follows HFS. We compared changes excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked action potentials changes RRP estimated asynchronous transmitter release elicited hypertonic solution. The changes EPSP correlated changes RRP, changes matched quantitatively connections whose initial synaptic strength greater median experiments. At weaker connections, increase RRP insufficient account PTP. Weaker connections initially released smaller fraction RRP EPSP stronger ones, fraction increased weaker connections HFS. Moreover, initial transmitter release response hypertonic solution accelerated HFS, indicating increase efficacy release restricted excitation-secretion coupling. Modulation RRP efficacy release thus contribute enhancement transmitter release HFS."

59,[Radiation-induced neuropathies: collateral damage improved cancer prognosis],"INTRODUCTION: Because improvement cancer prognosis, long-term damages treatments become medical public health problem. Among iatrogenic complications, neurological impairment crucial consider since motor disability pain considerable impact quality life long cancer survivors. However, radiation-induced neuropathies focus great attention. The objective paper provide updated review radiation-induced lesions peripheral nerve system. STATE OF THE ART: Radiation-induced neuropathies characterized heterogeneity symptoms disease course. Signs symptoms depend affected structures peripheral nerve system (nerve roots, nerve plexus nerve trunks). Early-onset complications often transient late complications usually progressive associated poor prognosis. The frequent well known delayed radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, may follow breast cancer irradiation. Radiation-induced lumbosacral radiculoplexopathy characterized pure predominant lower motor neuron signs. They misdiagnosed, confused amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) leptomeningeal metastases since nodular MRI enhancement nerve roots cauda equina increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content observed.

INTRODUCTION: Because improvement cancer prognosis, long-term damages treatments become medical public health problem. Among iatrogenic complications, neurological impairment crucial consider since motor disability pain considerable impact quality life long cancer survivors.

STATE OF THE ART: Radiation-induced neuropathies characterized heterogeneity symptoms disease course. Signs symptoms depend affected structures peripheral nerve system (nerve roots, nerve plexus nerve trunks). Early-onset complications often transient late complications usually progressive associated poor prognosis. The frequent well known delayed radiation-induced brachial plexopathy, may follow breast cancer irradiation.

Data used prospective, observational study   lansprazole users followed time (-). The study designed according SAMM guidelines. A nested case-control used compare proton pump inhibitor users reporting diarrhoea reporting diarrhoea. Results. The frequency diarrhoea .% incidence density . per  patient months proton pump inhibitor use. The diarrhoea commonly loose occurred average . times per day. The analysis co-factors revealed patients concomitant use oral antibiotics patients reporting neurological and/or dermatological adverse events, risk developing diarrhoea proton pomp inhibitor use. Conclusions. In conclusion, diarrhoea frequently reported study clinical trials observational data lansoprazole users. We found concomitant use oral antibiotics reporting certain adverse events associated reporting diarrhoea lansoprazole use. Although relationship proton pump inhibitor intake seemed plausible, recommend use concomitant medicines cause diarrhoea must taken consideration lansoprazole users.

BACKGROUND: Hypofractionated-SRS (HF-SRS) may allow improved local control reduced risk radiation necrosis compared single-fraction-SRS (SF-SRS). However, data comparing two treatment approaches limited. The study compare clinical outcomes SF-SRS versus HF-SRS across multi-center academic network. METHODS: Patients treated SF-SRS HF-SRS brain metastasis   across  radiation oncology centers retrospectively reviewed. SF-SRS dosing standardized, whereas HF-SRS dosing regimens variable. The co-primary endpoints local control radiation necrosis estimated using Kaplan Meier method. Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards modeling performed evaluate impact select independent variables outcomes interest. Propensity score adjustments used reduce effects confounding variables. To assess dose response HF-SRS, Biologic Effective Dose (BED) assuming alpha/beta  (BED<sub></sub>) used surrogate total dose. RESULTS: One-hundred fifty six patients  brain metastasis treated SF-SRS (n =  lesions) HF-SRS (n =  lesions) included. Prior whole brain radiation given % (n = ) % (n = ) lesions treated SF-SRS HF-SRS, respectively (p = .). After median follow time  months cohort, adjusted -year rate local control incidence radiation necrosis % (% CI -%) % (% CI -%) (p = .) % (% CI -%) % (% CI .-%) (p = .) SF-SRS HF-SRS, respectively. For lesions >  cm, adjusted  year local control % (% CI -%) SF-SRS % (% CI -%) HF-SRS (p = .). On multivariate analysis, SRS fractionation associated local control size <= cm associated decreased risk developing radiation necrosis (HR .; % CI .-., p < .). For HF-SRS,  year local control % lesions treated BED<sub></sub> >=  compared % (% CI -%) lesions received BED<sub></sub> <  (p = .). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison study dose fractionation treatment brain metastases, difference local control radiation necrosis HF-SRS SF-SRS. For HF-SRS, BED<sub></sub> >=  may improve local control."

Approximately one third patients, however, experience progressive enlargement residual pituitary adenoma, develop hyperpigmentation, elevated level serum ACTH.

METHODS: The prospectively collected University Virginia Gamma Knife database patients pituitary adenomas reviewed identify individuals Nelson's syndrome treated GKS. Twenty-three patients minimum  months follow identified database.

It hypothesized individual radiosensitivity medulloblastomas depends individual capability undergo apoptosis. p protein involved apoptotic response ionizing radiation; loss function p consequence TP mutations, also amplification and/or overexpression MDM gene. We analyzed cerebellar medulloblastomas  adults (> years age) MDM gene amplification (by differential polymerase chain reaction assay), TP gene mutation (by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis exons -), immunohistochemical expression p (clone DO) MDM (clone IF). The evaluated relation age, tumor location, classic desmoplastic type, MIB- labeling index, total survival. No tumor MDM amplification. Ten tumors MDM positive tumor cells. One case mutated TP gene; / cases intense p immunostaining. Only  MDM protein-positive tumors also p-positive. Both subgroups MDM - p-positive tumors significantly shorter postoperative survival.

For glioblastoma median survival time  months, -year survival probability anaplastic astrocytoma % approximately. Quality life acceptable. Acute side effects following treatment headache, seizures worsening pre-existing neurological symptoms. Late side effects skin necrosis and,  case, delayed aphasia probably due vascular lesion. CONCLUSION: Radioimmunotherapy prolonged survival time selected group patients malignant gliomas compared historical control group.
