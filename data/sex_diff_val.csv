Results In short-term analysis (mean . months), patients' self-reported pain intensity worst significantly correlated dose rate multivariate analysis (p = .). Similarly, patients' self-reported interference activities daily living closely correlated dose rate multivariate analysis (p = .). A  Gy/min decrease dose rate resulted % decrease pain intensity worst % decrease pain interference activities daily living. In longer-term follow-up (mean . years), GKRS higher dose rates (> . Gy/min; p = .) older age deciles (p = .) associated lower likelihood recurrence pain. Discussion Prior studies investigating role dose rate Gamma Knife radiosurgical ablation TN used validated outcome tools measure pain preoperatively. Consequently, differences pain outcomes difficult measure. By administering pain scales preoperatively well postoperatively, authors identified statistically significant differences pain intensity pain interference activities daily living comparing higher versus lower dose rates. Radiosurgery higher dose rate pain relief early follow-up evaluation, may result lower recurrence rate later follow-up.Copyright © AANS, ."

The small- medium-sized VS treated stereotactic radiosurgery, large VS require surgical decompression relief cerebellar dysfunction increased intracranial pressure. We performing planned partial surgical resections followed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) large VS. Here, evaluate recent series cases standpoint functional outcomes. Methods From January  May , treated  patients large unilateral VS (maximum tumor diameter least  mm) planned partial tumor removal followed GKS functional preservation. The median maximum diameter tumors . mm (range - mm). All patients underwent surgery via retrosigmoid approach, tumors situated ventral internal auditory canal intentionally removed, thus preserving cranial nerve functions. GKS performed - months surgical resection (median interval  months). The median tumor volume GKS . cm (range .-. cm) median prescribed dose  Gy (range - Gy). The median follow-up period GKS  months (- months). Results At final follow-up, facial nerve preservation (House-Brackmann grade I-II) achieved  patients (%; House-Brackmann grade I: .%, II: .%). Among  patients preoperative pure tone average (PTA) less  dB,  (.%) maintained PTA less  dB last follow-up. Two patients improved severe hearing loss PTA less  dB ( patient surgery  patient one half years GKS). Five- -year tumor growth control occurred % patients.

The small- medium-sized VS treated stereotactic radiosurgery, large VS require surgical decompression relief cerebellar dysfunction increased intracranial pressure. We performing planned partial surgical resections followed gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) large VS. Here, evaluate recent series cases standpoint functional outcomes. Methods From January  May , treated  patients large unilateral VS (maximum tumor diameter least  mm) planned partial tumor removal followed GKS functional preservation. The median maximum diameter tumors . mm (range - mm). All patients underwent surgery via retrosigmoid approach, tumors situated ventral internal auditory canal intentionally removed, thus preserving cranial nerve functions.

358,Clinical efficacy postoperative chemotherapy esophageal squamous cell cancer preoperative chemoradiotherapy combined surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcome postoperative chemotherapy resectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) preoperative chemoradiotherapy combined surgery (trimodality therapy). METHOD(S): From January ,  December , ,  consecutive locally advanced ESCC patients undergone trimodality therapy successfully included. Grouping based degree myelosuppression occurred preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Of  patients,  patients underwent trimodality therapy (group A),  patients received postoperative chemotherapy additionally trimodality therapy (group B). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy included two cycles chemotherapy concurrently radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consisted cisplatin  mg/(m.d) fluorouracil  mg/(m.d) administered intravenously days - -days cycle. Concurrent radiotherapy delivered total  Gy  fractions. All patients underwent surgery successfully. For  patients group B, additional   cycles postoperative chemotherapy administered chemotherapy regimen before.
