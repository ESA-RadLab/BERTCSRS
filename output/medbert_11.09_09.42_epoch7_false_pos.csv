51,"Effects of different gamma exposure regimes on reproduction in the earthworm Eisenia fetida (Oligochaeta) Ecological risk assessment of ionising radiation requires knowledge about the responses of individuals and populations to chronic exposures, including situations when exposure levels change over time. The present study investigated processes such as recovery and the adaptive response with respect to reproduction endpoints in the earthworm Eisenia fetida exposed to (60)Co gamma-radiation. Furthermore, a crossed experiment was performed to investigate the influence of F0 parental and F1 embryonic irradiation history on the response of irradiated or non-irradiated F1 offspring. Recovery: The sterility induced by sub-chronic exposure at 17 m Gy/h (accumulated dose: 25 Gy) was temporary, and 8 weeks after irradiation the worms had regained their reproductive capacity (number of viable offspring produced per adult per week). Adaptive response: Adult worms were continuously exposed at a low priming dose rate of 0.14 mGy/h for 12 weeks (accumulated dose: 0.24 Gy), followed by 14 weeks exposure at a challenge dose rate of 11 mGy/h. The results suggest a lack of adaptive response, since there were no significant differences in the effects on reproduction capacity between the primed and the unprimed groups after challenge doses ranging from 7.6 to 27 Gy. Crossed experiment: The effects of exposure at 11 mGy/h for 21 weeks on growth, sexual maturation and reproduction of offspring, derived either from parent worms and cocoons both exposed at 11 mGy/h, or from non-irradiated parents and cocoons (total accumulated dose 44 and 38 Gy, respectively) were compared. There were no significant differences between the two exposed offspring groups for any of the endpoints. The reproduction capacity was very low for both groups compared to the controls, but the reproduction seemed to be maintained at the reduced level, which could indicate acclimatisation or stabilisation. Finally, parental and embryonic exposures at 11 mGy/h did not affect reproduction in the F1 offspring as adults. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.97631204
1025,"Effect of gamma radiation on the biology of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma. I. Following larval exposure One and seven days old larvae of the flesh fly, Parasarcophaga argyrostoma were exposed to doses ranging from 1-90 Gy. Lower doses ranging from 1-9 Gy applied to young larvae accelerate larval development whereas old larvae responded to doses from 10-90 Gy by a remarkable retardation of the larval and pupal development. Reduction in percentage pupation and adult emergence were noticed with increment in the radiation doses applied. This reduction was higher for irradiated seven days old larvae than the one day old larvae at all doses applied, indicating that young larvae were more susceptible to gamma radiation than the older one. At higher doses (30-70 Gy) the pupae could not continue their development and died within 17 days after pupation. The longevity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was decreased by increasing the radiation dosage and it was found that adults emerging from irradiated young larvae lived shorter than those from irradiated young ones, the fecundity of adults resulted from irradiated larvae was also decreased by gamma irradiation exposures. The percentage reduction of larviposition was 100% for irradiated females with 8 Gy while that of irradiated males was 97.5% indicating that females were more sensitive to radiation than males.",Excluded,0.9762042
1011,"Effect of cobalt-60 gamma radiation on reproductive disturbance in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man, 1879) The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of acute level of 60Co gamma radiation on fecundity of freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii. Prawns were exposed to four different dose levels (3, 30, 300 and 3000 mGy) and their reproductive disturbances i.e Gonadosomatic Index (GSI), Egg Clutch somatic Index (ESI), Egg Counts and Egg hatching rates were calculated. The experimental group showed significant reduction in GSI (0.47 +/- 0.01) & ESI (1.22 +/- 0.08) after exposure to 60Co gamma radiation. Egg Count (3713 +/- 21) and Egg hatching rates (3798 +/- 11) were significantly reduced in all irradiated groups. The number of dead larva increased with the increasing level of doses. With the increase in dosage level, the gonad and egg clutch weight were decreased which likely lead to reduced number of eggs. Our results proved that even low level of ionizing radiation (60Co) affects the fecundities of freshwater crustacean M. rosenbergii.Copyright © 2019 The Authors",Excluded,0.9761915
802,"Sex-specific differences in fetal germ cell apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that male human fetal germ cells are highly radiosensitive and that their death depends on p53 activation. Male germ cell apoptosis was initiated with doses as low as 0.1 Gy and was prevented by pifithrin alpha, a p53 inhibitor. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitivity of early female and male fetal proliferating germ cells.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Both male and female fetal germ cells displayed a similar number of gamma H2AX foci in response to ionizing radiation (IR). In organ culture of human fetal ovaries, the germ cells underwent apoptosis only when exposed to high doses of IR (1.5 Gy and above). Accumulation of p53 was detected in irradiated male human fetal germ cells but not in female ones. Inhibition of p53 with pifithrin alpha did not affect oogonia apoptosis following irradiation. IR induced apoptosis similarly in mouse fetal ovaries in organ culture and in vivo during oogonial proliferation. Germ cell survival in testes from p53 knockout or p63 knockout mice exposed to IR was better than wild-type, whereas female germ cell survival was unaffected by p53 or p63 knockout.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that pre-meiotic male and female fetal germ cells behave differently in response to a genotoxic stress--irradiation--with oogonia being less sensitive and undergoing p53-independent apoptosis.",Excluded,0.97609806
1005,"A comparison of in vivo cellular responses to CS-137 gamma rays and 320-KV X rays Research reported here relates to comparing the relative effectiveness of 320-kV X rays compared to Cs-137 gamma rays for two in vivo endpoints in C.B-17 mice after whole-body exposure: (1) cytotoxicity to bone marrow cells and splenocytes evaluated at 24-hours post exposure and (2) bone marrow and spleen reconstitution deficits (repopulation shortfalls) evaluated at 6 weeks post exposure. We show that cytotoxicity dose-response relationships for bone marrow cells and splenocytes are complex, involving negative curvature (decreasing slope as dose increases), presumably implicating a mixed cell population comprised of large numbers of hypersensitive, modestly radiosensitive, and resistant cells. The radiosensitive cells appear to respond with 50% being killed by a dose < 0.5 Gy. The X-ray relative biological effectiveness (RBE), relative to gamma rays, for destroying bone marrow cells in vivo is > 1, while for destroying splenocytes it is < 1. In contrast, dose-response relationships for reconstitution deficits in the bone marrow and spleen of C.B-17 mice at 6 weeks after radiation exposure were of the threshold type with gamma rays being more effective in causing reconstitution deficit. © 2013 University of Massachusetts.",Excluded,0.976082
225,"Changes in X-ray sensitivity of mouse eggs from fertilization to the early pronuclear stage, and their repair capacity To study the changes in radiosensitivity of male and female genomes from fertilization to the pronuclear stage, the frequency of induced chromosome aberrations was examined at the first-cleavage metaphase in eggs fertilized with X-irradiated sperm, in eggs X-irradiated at the mature oocyte stage immediately before fertilization, and in fertilized eggs exposed to X-rays at various stages before DNA synthesis (1-5 h after insemination). Gametic treatment, fertilization and embryo culture were carried out in vitro. Most of the induced chromosome aberrations were chromosome-type aberrations, the frequency of chromosome fragments being the highest, followed by chromosome exchanges in both sperm and oocytes. The induction of chromosome-type aberrations was much higher in oocytes than in sperm. Chromosome-type aberrations were the main type also in fertilized eggs irradiated at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. The radiosensitivity increased gradually with pronuclear formation (1-4h after insemination), but little difference in radiosensitivity was observed between eggs irradiated at 4 h and 5 h, corresponding to the stage when pronuclear formation was complete. The drastic change with pronuclear formation was found not only in radiosensitivity but also in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. The frequency of chromosome-type exchanges decreased drastically 2 h after insemination, and exchanges were barely observed at 5 h. The difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes also markedly changed with pronuclear formation, the chromosome aberration induction in the female genome being much higher than that in the male genome before accomplishment of pronuclear formation. The analysis of potentiation effects of 3-aminobenzamide and caffeine on the yield of X-ray-induced chromosome aberrations demonstrated that the increase of radiosensitivity and the decrease of chromosome-type exchange induction with pronuclear formation, may be closely correlated with alterations in chromatin configuration in the pronuclei and in repair capacity of fertilized eggs at the pre-DNA-synthetic stage. No evidence based on repair efficiency was found for the marked difference in radiosensitivity between male and female genomes during pronuclear formation.",Excluded,0.9760776
487,"Radioprotection of hematopoietic stem cells by interleukin-1 Radioprotective agents such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), when given prior to irradiation, protect animals from radiation damage. However, in vivo administration of these cytokines does not allow one to determine whether the protective effects act directly on the hematopoietic system. In the present study, we subjected male bone marrow cells to in vitro treatment with IL-1 prior to irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. We found that male bone marrow cells pretreated with IL-1 prior to irradiation increased the survival of irradiated female recipient mice when compared with nontreated irradiated marrow cells. In addition, irradiated female recipients that received IL-1-pretreated male donor bone marrow cells displayed an increased presence of male donor cells in their bone marrow, spleen, and thymus for up to 3 months posttransplant. Furthermore, serial transplantation studies revealed that male cells could only be detected in tertiary female recipients who received bone marrow from mice transplanted with IL-1-treated cells. These results indicate that IL-1 pretreatment protects both short-term and long-term repopulating stem cells from an irradiation insult and that these cells are capable of reconstituting the myeloid and lymphoid organs of recipient mice.",Excluded,0.9759872
143,"Telomere stability correlates with longevity of human beings exposed to ionizing radiations Normal somatic cells have a finite number of divisions, a limited capacity to proliferate. Human telomeres contain TTAGGG repeats which are considered a molecular clock marker. The gradual and progressive telomere shortening at each replicative cycle is associated, through the activation of pRB and p53 pathways and genomic instability, to the replicative senescence, a non-dividing state and widespread cell death. There is no information available about telomere status in individuals who live long and have been exposed to ionizing radiations (IR). To determine the telomere stability, we examined telomeres at metaphase, G2-type chromosome aberrations after IR treatment and karyotypic analysis of 15 individuals. Three individuals were above the age of 80 years and 1 among the 3 was estimated to have received more than 10 Gy of occupational exposure about 30 years back. The other 12 were cancer patients that had received more than 50 Gy of gamma-radiation for therapeutic purposes. No telomere instability or defective G2 chromosome repair was found in 3 individuals above the age of 80 years. Whereas, 3 out of 7 prostate and 1 out of 5 breast cancer patients showed higher G2-type chromosome damage as well as a high frequency of telomeric association (also known as chromosome end associations) along with frequent loss of telomeres. Present studies demonstrate that telomere stability along with normal G2 chromosome repair correlates with the longevity of human beings, whereas defective G2 chromosome repair and telomere instability correlate with the radiotherapy related late toxicity.",Excluded,0.97595084
133,"[Adaptive response of blood lymphocytes as a marker of hemopoiesis status in exposed persons] An obvious correlation between the type of reaction manifested by peripheral blood lymphocytes to low dose irradiation in vitro (adaptive potential), the RBM cell composition (during the period of the major exposure), and the peripheral blood cell composition (at a late time period coincident with the studies of induced radioresistance) has been found in the Techa riverside residents in the later periods after the onset of a long-term low-dose rate radiation exposure (55-60 years later) within a range of individual red bone marrow doses from 0.01 to 1.79 Gy. The nature of these dependences observed in chronically exposed individuals differs from that revealed in the controls. It can be suggested based on the results of the study that the capacity for the adaptive response shown by peripheral blood lymphocytes donated by exposed persons in the remote period after exposure can be regarded as a biological marker of the functional state of the hemopoietic stem cell pool.",Excluded,0.9759296
955,"High incidence of mosaic mutations induced by irradiating paternal germ cells of the medaka fish, Oryzias latipes Delayed-type mutations induced by radiation have recently been demonstrated in various somatic-cell systems. Such mutations are thought to result from the transmission of genetic instability through many cell divisions subsequent to a single exposure to ionizing radiation. Here, we have examined whether 'transgenerational' delayed-type mutations can arise during embryonic development of the medaka fish as a result of exposing the sperm and spermatids of live fish to 137 Cs gamma-radiation. To do this, we made use of a sensitive specific-locus test (SLT) for the medaka that we have recently developed. Because the medaka has a transparent egg membrane and embryo body, both visible mosaics and whole-body mutations can be detected during development at an early-expressed pigmentation locus. When wild-type +/+ males were gamma-irradiated and then mated with wl/wl females, the frequency of F1 embryos with both wild-type orange leucophores (wl/+) and mutant-type white leucophores (wl/wl*) (mosaic mutants) was about 5.7 x 10-3/Gy. The frequency of embryos with only white leucophores (whole-body mutants) was about 1.3 x 10-3/Gy. These results suggest that delayed mutations frequently arise in medaka fish embryos that have been fertilized with irradiated sperm. Some possible mechanisms involved in the generation of these delayed mutational events (including genomic instability in the early embryos) are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",Excluded,0.9758095
828,"Gamma-H2AX-based dose estimation for whole and partial body radiation exposure Most human exposures to ionising radiation are partial body exposures. However, to date only limited tools are available for rapid and accurate estimation of the dose distribution and the extent of the body spared from the exposure. These parameters are of great importance for emergency triage and clinical management of exposed individuals. Here, measurements of gamma-H2AX immunofluorescence by microscopy and flow cytometry were compared as rapid biodosimetric tools for whole and partial body exposures. Ex vivo uniformly X-irradiated blood lymphocytes from one donor were used to generate a universal biexponential calibration function for gamma-H2AX foci/intensity yields per unit dose for time points up to 96 hours post exposure. Foci--but not intensity--levels remained significantly above background for 96 hours for doses of 0.5 Gy or more. Foci-based dose estimates for ex vivo X-irradiated blood samples from 13 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered to the targeted samples. Flow cytometric dose estimates for X-irradiated blood samples from 8 volunteers were in excellent agreement with the actual dose delivered at 1 hour post exposure but less so at 24 hours post exposure. In partial body exposures, simulated by mixing ex vivo irradiated and unirradiated lymphocytes, foci/intensity distributions were significantly over-dispersed compared to uniformly irradiated lymphocytes. For both methods and in all cases the estimated fraction of irradiated lymphocytes and dose to that fraction, calculated using the zero contaminated Poisson test and gamma-H2AX calibration function, were in good agreement with the actual mixing ratios and doses delivered to the samples. In conclusion, gamma-H2AX analysis of irradiated lymphocytes enables rapid and accurate assessment of whole body doses while dispersion analysis of foci or intensity distributions helps determine partial body doses and the irradiated fraction size in cases of partial body exposures.",Excluded,0.975805
350,"Translocation analysis by the FISH-painting method for retrospective dose reconstruction in individuals exposed to ionizing radiation 10 years after exposure Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a powerful method largely used for detecting chromosomal rearrangements, translocations in particular, which are important biomarkers for dose assessment in case of human exposure to ionizing radiation. To test the possibility of using the translocation analysis by FISH-painting method in retrospective dose assessment, we carried out in vitro experiments in irradiated human lymphocytes, in parallel with the analysis of translocations in lymphocytes from 10 individuals, who were exposed to 137cesium in the Goiania (Brazil) accident (samples collected 10 years after exposure). The in vitro dose-response curve for the genomic translocation frequencies (FGs) fits a linear quadratic model, according to the equation: Y=0.0243X2+0.0556X. The FG values were also calculated for the individuals exposed to 137cesium, ranging from 0.58 to 5.91 per 100 cells, and the doses were estimated and compared with the results obtained by dicentric analysis soon after the accident, taking the opportunity to test the validity of translocation analysis in retrospective biodosimetry. A tentative of retrospective dosimetry was performed, indicating that the method is feasible only for low level exposure (below 0.5Gy), while for higher doses there is a need to apply appropriate correction factors, which take into consideration mainly the persistence of chromosomal translocations along with time, and the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors determining the inter-individual variability in the cellular responses to radiation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

883,"Chromosome anomalies in mouse oocytes after irradiation We investigated the cytogenetic effects of X-rays on unfertilized mouse oocytes. NMRI females received an irradiation with 0,22.2,66.6,200, and 600 R during the preovulatory phase 3 hrs after HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin). This is a stage during oogenesis in which the oocytes pass from late dictyotene to diakinesis. Chromosome analysis was performed after ovulation at metaphase II. From these experiments we can draw the following conclusions: 1) X-rays induced during the preovulatory phase a high number of chromosome anomalies. Among these, structural anomalies prevail. 7 out of 144 ovulated oocytes in matched controls carried such an abnormality, whereas after irradiation we observed with 22.2, 66.6, 200, and 600 R, 11 out of 72, 34 out of 108, 89 out of 102, and 122 out of 124, respectively. 2) Irradiation seems also to affect the chromosome segregation during the 1. meiotic division, as we observed after 22.2, 66.6, and 200 R a total of 6 oocytes out of 204 with a supernummary chromosome. In controls, however, no hyperploidy was found in 143 ova. This increase, however, was not significant. 3) Chromosome anomalies, e.g. breaks and deletions that go back to a one-break event increased linearly with increasing dose. Exchanges, however, going back to two-break events fittest best to the linear-quadratic dose-response model. 4) The dose of 600 R seems to represents a kind of borderline in this experiment, because nearly all (122 out 124) carried at least one structural chromosome anomaly. It is also this dose after which the highest frequency of reciprocal translocations was observed in a hump-shaped slope in spermatocytes after irradiation of spermatogonia (Preston and Brewen, 1973). With an increasing dosage up to 1200 R the frequency of translocations decrease again. The elimination of cells, crossing this borderline, might be due to genetic or non-genetic effects. 5) The frequency of radiation-induced translocations per oocyte agrees with the frequency of translocations in human lymphocytes (Dolphin and Lloyd, 1974) after in vitro irradiation. 6) Significant, lower frequencies of structural chromosome anomalies were observed irradiating earlier stages of mouse oogenesis. These stages are dictyotene from females at the age of 3, or 6 weeks and prophase I-stages in female embryos on the 17th day of gestation. This result may be due to a lower sensitivity of these stages or to modifying events during the interval between irradiation and preparations.",Excluded,0.97578114
844,"Induction of malformations by X-ray exposure of various stages of the oogenesis of mice We studied the effects of ionizing radiation (X-rays, 0-3 Gy, dose rate 1 Gy/min) on various stages of oogenesis of a mouse strain (HLG/Zte) that had been shown previously to respond with an increased number of malformations after radiation exposure of preimplantation stages. Like the results obtained with preimplantation stages, we observed a statistically significant increase in the number of malformed fetuses (exclusively gastroschises) on day 19 of gestation, when oocytes within 1-4 weeks before ovulation were exposed to 2 or 3 Gy. Less mature oocytes were killed by radiation doses of 0.5 Gy and higher. In addition to the increased frequency of malformations, we found a dose-dependent increase of lethal effects (affecting either oocytes or specific gestational stages) and of runts ('dwarfs').",Excluded,0.9757184
1108,"Irradiated laboratory animal diets: dominant lethal studies in the mouse In 4 separate dominant lethal experiments groups of mice of either Charles River CD1 or Alderley Park strains were fed laboratory diets (Oakes, 41B, PRD, BP nutrition rat and mouse maintenance diet No. 1). The diets were either untreated (negative control diets) or irradiated at 1, 2.5 and 5 megarad and were freshly irradiated, or stored. The animals were fed their test diets for a period of 3 weeks prior to mating. Groups of mice given a single intraperitoneal injection of 200 mg cyclophosphamide per kg body weight served as the positive controls. Freshly irradiated PRD diet fed to male mice of both strains caused an increase in early deaths in females mated to the males in week 7 and to a lesser extent in week 4. The increase due to irradiation was small by comparison with that produced by the positive control compound. The responses for the other irradiated diets showed no significant increases in early deaths although some values for Oakes diet were high. The effect of storage was examined with PRD and BPN diet on one occasion and produced conflicting results. Thus there was some evidence that irradiated PRD diet has weak mutagenic activity in the meiotic and/or pre-meiotic phase of the spermatogenic cycle which appeared to be lessened on storage; the inclusion of such a diet in toxicological studies would therefore need to be carefully considered.",Excluded,0.975658

Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the alteration occurred in testes and DNA pattern as an effect of inherited sterility. Full grown pupae of the wax moth, Galleria mellonella were irradiated with 80 and 160 Gy of gamma irradiation. The size of the testes was decreased by increasing of gamma irradiation dose. Also, the size of the testes was decreased in F 1 males comparing with the size of the testes of both the parents and the untreated control. The effects of gamma rays on the DNA patterns of adult male parents and F 1 males showed alterations among the controls, the treated parents and F 1 individuals.

1035,"Variant Splicing and Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K) Transcripts in Cancer Cell Lines Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is the most intact retrovirus in the human genome. There are multiple full-length or near full-length HERV-K proviruses in it. To analyze which HERV-K proviruses give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether ionizing radiation can alter the levels of HERV-K transcripts, RT-PCR studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell lines. Primers from several positions in the viral genome were used and included pairs designed to cross splice junctions in viral RNAs. In the absence of ionizing radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple HERV-K proviruses in cell lines from human prostate, cervical, head and neck, or breast cancers, and the proviruses from which the transcripts originated varied among the different lines. Only one of 13 cell lines tested (cervical cancer line C33A) failed to show HERV-K transcripts. Spliced RNAs detected included viral RNAs spliced as expected at the conventional viral splice sites, plus several alternatively spliced RNAs. Alternatively spliced transcripts arose from specific proviruses, and were detected in most of the cell lines used. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to assess the effects of ionizing radiation. These analyses showed that HERV-K transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer line. The increases were transient, peaking at 24 hours following a single dose of gamma-irradiation that ranged from 2.5 to 20 Gy, and returning to baseline levels by 72 hours. In summary, these studies showed that ionizing radiation can affect the levels of HERV-K transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different cells. The changes in HERV-K transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of ionizing radiation on HERV-K are worth pursuing. © 2013 Agoni et al.",Excluded,0.97553957

A dose of 3000 rads of betatron X-rays produced a mutation rate of 4.36 X 10(-8) per rad/locus. Among the mutations observed, 66% were recessive lethals and 34% viable when homozygous. Only one of the 24 viable mutations was associated with a chromosome aberration. Among the 47 recessive lethals, no two-break aberrations were detected in 48.9% of the lethals, deletions were associated with 42.2%, inversions with 6.7% and translocations with 2.2%.-When these genetic results are compared to those for 250 KV X-rays, the mutation rate for betatron treatments was slightly lower (.76), the recessive lethal rate among induced mutations was higher, and the chromosome aberrations among lethal mutations were slightly lower than with 250 KV X-rays.

177,"Effect of irradiation, asbestos and chemical cocarcinogens on incidence of sarcoma on implants An implant can act as a physical carcinogen. Chemicals applied to its surface can augment that. To explore if cocarcinogenesis would affect the incidence of tumour on implants, we tested several physical (asbestos, beta irradiation) and chemical (acridine orange, phorbol methyl ester, cigarette smoke tar, extract of Agaricus bisporus mushroom) carcinogens on 25 mm diameter nitrocellulose filters implanted in groups of BALB/c mice in 9 experiments. Saline was applied in 287 concurrent controls. Irradiation by 540 kBq I-125 fibrinogen on foreign bodies of surface area 20sq cm induced tumour in 6/6 pilot animals (expected 2/6) and in 25/36 animals (controls 13/29; p < 0.04). The mean dose (beta and gamma) to cells within 20 mum of the filter surface was estimated to be 782 mGy. Exposures to 270kBq or less were not significantly cocarcinogenic with single implants. Radiation from the paired implants was detectible up to 80 weeks. Asbestos, however, 2.3 or 4.6 mgm on implants did not in 3 trials increase sarcoma yield significantly, but did induce mesothelial-type growths in the peritoneum. Asbestos (2.3 mg) injected without an implant provoked no tumour at the site. The chemical carcinogen acridine orange gave ambiguous results, and the others reduced tumour incidence insignificantly.

174,"Profiles of non-cancer diseases in atomic bomb survivors This article summarizes the results of a recent study of atomic bomb radiation and non-cancer diseases in the AHS (Adult Health Study) population by the RERF (Radiation Effects Research Foundation) along with a general discussion of previous studies. The association of atomic bomb radiation and CVD was examined by incidence studies and prevalence studies of various endpoints of atherosclerosis, such as MI, stroke, aortic arch calcification, isolated systolic hypertension, and pulse wave velocity, and, although the excess was small, all endpoints indicated an increase of CVD in the heavily exposed group. Because of the consistency of the results, it is almost certain that CVD is higher among atomic bomb survivors. However, all CVD risk factors associated with lifestyle had not necessarily been adjusted for in studies to date, and it is difficult at present to conclude that the increase in CVD among survivors was a direct effect of radiation. Recent studies have demonstrated almost certainly that uterine myoma is more frequent among atomic bomb survivors. It cannot, at present, be concluded that uterine myoma is caused by radiation, because there are no reported studies of other exposed populations. Further analyses including the role of confounding factors as well as molecular approaches are needed to verify this radiation effect. The relationship between atomic bomb radiation exposure and hyperparathyroidism can now be said to have been established in view of the strong dose response, the agreement with results of studies of other populations, the high risk in the younger survivors, and the biological plausibility. Future studies by molecular approaches, etc., are needed to determine the pathogenic mechanism. Among other benign tumours, a dose response has been demonstrated for tumours of the thyroid, stomach and ovary. Although fewer studies have been conducted than for cancer, a clear association between radiation and various benign tumours is emerging. Concerning the association between atomic bomb radiation exposure and chronic liver diseases, the recent incidence study of members of the AHS population demonstrated a significant dose response. Both chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were suggested as being associated with exposure. The possibility that the increased occurrence of chronic liver diseases among the survivors may be due to hepatitis virus infection cannot be excluded, and the results of the ongoing hepatitis C virus antibody titre studies are awaited.",Excluded,0.9754554

Here we present the results of an unbiased, comprehensive genome-wide survey of the range of germline mutations induced in laboratory mice after parental exposure to ionizing radiation and show irradiation markedly alters the frequency and spectrum of de novo mutations. Here we show that the frequency of de novo copy number variants (CNVs) and insertion/deletion events (indels) is significantly elevated in offspring of exposed fathers. We also show that the spectrum of induced de novo single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) is strikingly different; with clustered mutations being significantly over-represented in the offspring of irradiated males. Our study highlights the specific classes of radiation-induced DNA lesions that evade repair and result in germline mutation and paves the way for similarly comprehensive characterizations of other germline mutagens.Copyright © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Excluded,0.9753015
725,"Multivariate analysis of low-dose radiation-associated changes in cytokine gene expression profiles using microarray technology OBJECTIVE: The availability of microarray technology, which permits evaluation of the entire cellular transcriptome in a single experiment, has provided new insights on the function of the genome under normal and pathological conditions, as well as in response to genotoxic stimuli, including ionizing radiation. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine whether specific cytokine gene expression profiles can be delineated in individuals exposed to chronic, low-dose radiation; and 2) compare analyses from three multivariate analytic methodologies, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and projection pursuit (PP), in evaluating transcriptional responses in human mononuclear cells to low doses of ionizing radiation (IR), as determined by cDNA microarrays., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total RNA isolated from mononuclear cells of 19 apparently healthy adult individuals exposed to low doses of IR ranging from 0.18 mSv to 49 mSv over a period of 11 to 13 years, as a result of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant catastrophe, was reverse transcribed in the presence of radioactive dATP to generate radiolabeled complementary cDNA. Target cDNA was hybridized to human cytokine and receptor arrays and mRNA transcriptional patterns were evaluated using HCA, PCA, and PP., RESULTS: Statistical analyses of the data generated from 19 microarrays revealed distinct gene expression patterns in mononuclear cells of individuals exposed to radiation doses of greater than 10 mSv or less than 10 mSv. Genes encompassed within clusters discerned by HCA, PCA, and PP varied depending on the methodology used to analyze the microarray data. The most frequently expressed genes across all radiation doses were serine/threonine protein kinase receptor (11/19), transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor (11/19), EB13 (10/19), and CD40 ligand., CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that it may be possible to assign gene expression profiles to low-dose-irradiated individuals, we show that gene expression profiles vary, depending on the statistical method used to analyze the data. Since there is, as of yet, no consensus regarding the best method to analyze a multivariate dataset, and since discarding the raw data and repeating the experiment at a later date constitutes an unwarranted expenditure, it is important to submit microarray data to public databases where these data can be reevaluated and interpreted by investigators holding expertise in various fields within the scientific community, including radiation biology, statistics, and bioinformatics.",Excluded,0.975288

Eggs at the pronuclear stage were exposed to beta-particles in a chemically defined medium containing tritiated water (HTO) for 2 h at 3-5 h after insemination. Other eggs at the same stage were exposed to gamma-rays from 60Co during the same period. The dose-response relationships for frequencies of chromosome aberrations per egg were fitted to a linear-quadratic model for HTO beta-particles, and to a linear model for 60Co gamma-rays. The chromosome aberrations were mainly chromosome-type, and the majority of all aberrations were fragments.

807,"Reanalysis of Hanford data: 1944-1986 deaths Reanalysis of Hanford data by a method, which is new only in the sense that it makes new uses of standard epidemiological procedures, has produced evidence of a cancer risk at low dose levels. By a conservative estimate, about three per cent of the pre-1987 cancer deaths of Hanford workers had occupational exposures to external radiation as the critical (induction) event. These radiogenic cancers were evenly distributed between five diagnostic groups, but as a result of there being much greater sensitivity to cancer induction by radiation"" after, rather than before, 50 years of age, they were concentrated among the cancers which proved fatal after 70 years of age. The reanalysis provides no support for the idea that radiation is more likely to cause leukemia than solid tumors, or the idea that there is reduced cancer effectiveness of radiation at low dose levels (dose rate effectiveness factor or DREF hypothesis), but the estimated proportion of radiogenic cancers was much higher for the 175 nonfatal cancers (which had other certified causes of death) than for the 1,732 fatal cases. Finally, according to the latest publication of the US Committee on Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR V), dose rate is more important than exposure age, and even a single exposure to 10 rem would only increase the normal cancer risk by four percent. Nevertheless, for all recorded exposures of Hanford workers, the estimated doubling dose was close to 26 rem; for exposures after 58 years, it was close to 5 rem, and for exposures after 62 years, it was less than 1 rem.""",Excluded,0.9749274

METHOD(S): The experimental animals were whole-body exposed to microwave radiation with frequency of 2,450 MHz, power density of 1, 5, 15 mW/cm(2) respectively 1 h everyday for 30 days. Then the thymus were taken out after the mice were decapitated. Thymus index, morphological characteristics of thymus were examined. The changes of thymus T-cell subgroups, cell cycle progression in thymocytes and cellular apoptosis were detected with flow cytometry (FCM). RESULT(S): The body weights of animals in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups [(28.10 +/- 1.46), (27.50 +/- 2.52) g] were lower than that of the control [(31.95 +/- 2.51) g] (P < 0.05). Pathological observation showed dark red piece of nucleus, some nuclei inclined to one side, slight increase in hassall body. The expressions of CD8 in 5, 15 mW/cm(2) irradiation groups (29.14% +/- 1.68%, 29.18% +/- 0.81%) were higher than that in control group (26.95% +/- 1.27%) (P < 0.05). The percentages of G(2) + M phase thymocytes in both radiation groups (12.24% +/- 1.82%, 11.19% +/- 1.36%) were lower than that in control group (14.58% +/- 0.64%) (P < 0.01). Thymocytic apoptosis rates in the three experimental groups (7.18% +/- 0.99%, 10.06% +/- 1.58%, 9.45% +/- 0.92%) were higher than that in control (4.25% +/- 1.63%) (P < 0.01), but the evident difference between 5 mW/cm(2) and 15 mW/cm(2) was not found (P > 0.05).

431,"Studies on mutagen-sensitive strains of Drosophila melanogaster, VIII. Further data on differences between Canton-S and ebony strains with respect to maternal effects for the X-ray induction of autosomal translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa The influence of the maternal genotype (Canton-S, proficient in the repair of X-ray-induced chromosome breaks and ebony, less proficient in this regard) on the recovery of X-ray-induced autosomal (II-III) translocations and ring-X chromosome losses in mature spermatozoa was studied. In the first series of experiments, males carrying appropriate markers on their second and third chromosomes were irradiated and mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of II-III translocations were determined. In the second series of experiments, males carrying ring-X chromosomes were irradiated in N2 or in O2, mated to Canton-S or ebony females and the frequencies of XO males were determined; additionally, under similar gas-treatment and radiation conditions, the pattern of egg-mortality was also assessed. The data on translocations show that the yields are higher with ebony than with Canton-S females; these and earlier results on dominant lethals and sex-linked recessive lethals support the interpretation that the maternal repair system in the ebony strain is less proficient and more error-prone than that of the Canton-S strain. Those on the losses of ring-X chromosomes demonstrate that (i) the absolute yields of XO males are lower with ebony than with Canton-S females irrespective of whether the parental males are irradiated in N2 or in O2; (ii) the exposure-frequency relationships are all linear, but the slopes are higher when the males are irradiated in O2 and are consistent with an oxygen-enhancement-ratio of about 1.5 and (iii) the relationships between the logarithm of egg-survival and XO male frequency are also linear, but the slopes for the O2 groups are lower than those for the N2 groups (slope ratios of 0.86-0.87). The finding that at given survival levels, the XO frequencies are lower in the O2 than in the N2 groups of both the Canton-S and ebony series viewed in the context of the mechanisms that have been postulated to explain the loss of ring-X chromosomes in irradiated mature spermatozoa permits the following interpretation for the observed results: (i) a higher proportion of potential XO zygotes is lost through dominant lethality in the O2 groups than in the N2 ones presumably because the chromosome breaks induced in O2 are qualitatively different in the sense that they have a higher probability to undergo reunions relative to restitution, compared with breaks induced under anoxia and (ii) this leads to lower than expected oxygen-enhancement ratios (i.e., expected on the basis of published data on sex-linked recessive lethals, another kind of genetic damage which shows a linear exposure-frequency relationship.",Excluded,0.9747078

413,"Soft-tissue allografts terminally sterilized with an electron beam are biomechanically equivalent to aseptic, nonsterilized tendons BACKGROUND: Allograft safety is contingent on effective sterilization. However, current sterilization methods have been associated with decreased biomechanical strength and higher failure rates of soft-tissue allografts. In this study, electron beam (e-beam) sterilization was explored as an alternative sterilization method to preserve biomechanical integrity. We hypothesized that e-beam sterilization would not significantly alter the biomechanical properties of tendon allograft compared with aseptic, nonsterilized controls and gamma-irradiated grafts., METHODS: Separate sets of forty fresh-frozen tibialis tendon allografts (four from each of ten donors) and forty bisected bone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts (four from each of ten donors) were randomly assigned to four study groups. One group received a 17.1 to 21.0-kGy gamma radiation dose; two other groups were sterilized with an e-beam at either a high (17.1 to 21.0-kGy) or low (9.2 to 12.2-kGy) dose. A fourth group served as nonsterilized controls. Each graft was cyclically loaded to 200 N of tension for 2000 cycles at a frequency of 2 Hz, allowed to relax for five minutes, and then tested in tension until failure at a 100%/sec strain rate. One-way analysis of variance testing was used to identify significant differences., RESULTS: Tibialis tendons sterilized with both e-beam treatments and with gamma irradiation exhibited values for cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus that were not significantly different from those of nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the high e-beam dose and with gamma irradiation were not significantly different in cyclic tendon elongation, maximum load, maximum displacement, stiffness, maximum stress, maximum strain, and elastic modulus from nonsterilized controls. BTB allografts sterilized with the e-beam at the lower dose were significantly less stiff than nonsterilized controls (p = 0.014) but did not differ from controls in any other properties. The difference in stiffness likely resulted from variations in tendon size rather than the treatments, as the elastic moduli of the groups were similar., CONCLUSIONS: The biomechanical properties of tibialis and BTB allografts sterilized with use of an e-beam at a dose range of 17.1 to 21.0 kGy were not different from those of aseptic, nonsterilized controls or gamma-irradiated allografts., CLINICAL RELEVANCE: E-beam sterilization can be a viable method to produce safe and biomechanically uncompromised soft-tissue allografts.

To determine the susceptibility of DS lymphocytes at G<inf>2</inf> phase, bleomycin, a radiomimetic agent, was used to induce DNA breaks in blood cultures from 24 Down syndrome patients. All the patients with DS showed free trisomy 21 (47,XX + 21 or 47,XY + 21). Individuals that showed an average number of chromatid breaks per cell higher than 0.8 were considered sensitive to the drug. No control child showed susceptibility to bleomycin, and among the 24 patients with DS, only one was sensitive to the drug. No significant difference was observed between the two groups, regarding chromatid break frequencies in treated G<inf>2</inf> lymphocytes. The distribution of bleomycin-induced breaks in each group of chromosomes was similar for DS and controls. No significant difference was found in the response to bleomycin between male and female subjects. Probably, the main factor involved in chromosome sensitivity of lymphocytes from patients with DS is the phase of the cell cycle in which the cell is treated.",Excluded,0.9740587

We created two types of in vitro dose-response calibration curves for dicentric chromosomes (DC) and translocations (TR) induced by X-ray irradiation, using an electron linear accelerator, which is the most frequently used medical device in radiotherapy. We irradiated samples from four healthy Korean individuals and compared the resultant curves between individuals. Aberration yields were studied in a total of 31,800 and 31,725 metaphases for DC and TR, respectively, obtained from 11 X-ray irradiation dose-points (0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 Gy).

The yield of induced genetic damage is known to be dependent on maternal genotype and can also be modified by treatment of the females with metabolic inhibitors. The experiments reported here were designed to find out whether a more specific analysis of the interaction between male gamete and oocyte cytoplasm can be carried out using mutants that are known to affect repair processes. Males carrying ring-X chromosomes were exposed to X-ray doses up to 1000 R and mated to females homozygous for a repair-deficient mutant.

In addition a yellow (y) X chromosome was used as a control and an attempt was made to obtain data using mei-21815, a mutant at a locus not thought to affect repair. With mei-9 mutants there is an enhancement of the spontaneous and induced rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss. The mei-41 mutants did not affect the rates of paternal sex-chromosome loss.

Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. To do so, hepatotoxicity was induced in rats by intraperitoneal administration of lead nitrate (7.5 mg/kg) thrice weekly for two consecutive weeks and/or a whole-body gamma-irradiation at a single dose of 6 Gy. Activated PRP (0.5 ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 24 h after the last dose of lead nitrate and/or gamma-irradiation and continued twice weekly for three successive weeks. Lead nitrate intoxication and/or gamma-irradiation resulted in a significant elevation of serum alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase activities accompanied with a significant decrease in serum levels of total protein and albumin. Further, a significant increase in malondialdehyde level and nitric oxide content accompanied with a significant decrease in the reduced glutathione content and the enzyme activities of glutathione-S-transferase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were observed. Additionally, hepatic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling pathways were stimulated. PRP treatment notably ameliorated the induced cell injury, reduced the intracellular oxidative and interestingly increased the upregulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. Moreover, PRP treatment relieved lead nitrate and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatic histological damages. In conclusion, this study sheds the light on a probable therapeutic role of PRP against lead nitrate- and/or gamma-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity which might attribute to its ability to activate ERK and Akt signaling pathways.",Excluded,0.9735156

However, despite the benefits of medical radiation exposures, adverse long-term health effects are cause for concern. Protein and gene biomarkers are early indicators of cellular response after low-dose exposure. We examined DNA damage by quantifying gamma-H2AX foci and expression of twelve candidate genes in the blood lymphocytes of patients exposed to low doses of X-radiation during neuro-interventional procedures. Entrance surface dose (ESD; 10.92-1062.55 mGy) was measured by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD). Absorbed dose was estimated using gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression, with in vitro dose-response curves generated for the same biomarkers. gamma-H2AX foci in post-exposure samples were significantly higher than in pre-exposure samples. Among the genes analysed, FDXR, ATM, BCL2, MDM2, TNFSF9, and PCNA showed increased expression; CDKN1A, DDB2, SESN1, BAX, and TNFRSF10B showed unchanged or decreased expression. Absorbed dose, estimated based on gamma-H2AX focus frequency and gene expression changes, did not show any correlation with measured ESD.

We have continued to follow up those individuals who show values of about three times higher than those of the control group.

In this report, the effect of implanted DU on adult rat behavior and health is described. Adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, 8 wk of age, were surgically implanted with 0, 4, 8, 12, or 20 DU pellets (1 x 2 mm); 20 DU pellets of size 1 x 2 mm approximates to 0.22 kg (0.5 lb) of DU in a 70-kg (154 lb) person. Control animals were implanted with 12 or 20 tantallum (Ta) pellets. The animals were then housed for up to 150 d postimplantation or 20% of an assumed 2-yr life span for rats. The concentration of uranium in urine directly correlated with the number of implanted DU pellets, indicating that DU was migrating into the body from the implanted pellets. Three male and 4 female animals died during the 150-d period of causes apparently not related to DU implantation. Behavioral testing found no definitive evidence of neurobehavioral perturbations associated with DU implantation. Uranium translocated to tissues known to sequester uranium (bone, teeth, and kidneys), but uranium concentrations varied considerably within each dose group and did not follow a dose-response pattern as anticipated. Serum chemistry values were within normal ranges for the SD rat. However, alanine aminotransferase measurements were significantly lower for rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to sham surgery controls but not when compared to animals implanted with Ta pellets only. Phosphate measurements were significantly lower for female rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to both sham surgery controls and animals implanted with Ta pellets only. Monocyte ratios were higher in adult rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to sham surgery controls but not when compared to animals implanted with 20 Ta pellets. Mean platelet volume was found to be significantly lower for rats implanted with 20 DU pellets as compared to sham surgery controls but not when compared to animals implanted with 20 Ta pellets. Gross necropsy found no obvious tissue abnormalities in implanted rats, and the weights of major tissues did not differ between Ta- and DU-implanted animals. Histopathologic analysis of major tissues from animals implanted with 0 pellets, 20 Ta pellets, or 20 DU pellets found no differences between treatment groups. The findings of this study indicate that implantation of up to 20 DU pellets in adult rats did not have a significant negative impact on their general health and neurobehavioral capacities when assessed after 150 d of pellet implantation.

Conventional cytogenetic end-points are now being improved by combining molecular methods, which increases the sensitivity, specificity, and precision of the assay. In this study we examined both spontaneous and gamma-ray induced CIN in lymphocyte cultures from 51 previously untreated glioma patients and 51 age-, sex- and ethnicity-matched controls. CIN was assessed using two parallel methods: (1) the mutagen sensitivity (MS) assay and (2) the multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. The frequency of spontaneous breaks was significantly higher in glioma patients (mean +/- S.D., 2.12 +/- 1.07) than in controls (1.24 +/- 0.86, P < 0.001) when using the FISH assay but not the MS assay (0.019 +/- 0.02 and 0.019 +/- 0.01, respectively; P = 0.915). Similarly, the frequency of induced chromatid breaks was significantly higher using the FISH assay (3.39 +/- 1.72) but not the MS assay (0.42 +/- 0.16) in the patients versus controls (2.08 +/- 1.18 and 0.37 +/- 0.15, respectively; P < 0.001 and P = 0.10, respectively). By using the median number of breaks in the controls as the cutoff value, we observed an odds ratio (ORs) of 5.13 (95% CI = 2.23-12.1) for spontaneous and 4.86 (95% CI = 2.08-11.4) for induced CIN using the FISH assay, whereas the ORs were 1.32 (95% CI = 0.49-3.58) and 1.28 (95% CI = 0.59-2.80) for spontaneous and induced CIN using the MS assay. There was also a significant increase in the frequency of hyperdiploid cells in the glioma cases which could only be detected using the FISH assay (OR = 4.0, 95% CL = 0.9-17.0). By combining both methods an estimated risk of 7.0 (95% CI = 1.7-25.6) was observed. There was no correlation between the breaks detected by the two methods suggesting that each method is a measure of a different event.

The goals of this study were to determine the effect of hypoxia on the cell survival responses of different cell models (H460, DU145, A549, MDA231 and FADU) to modulated fields and to characterize the time dependency of signaling under oxic conditions, following reoxygenation and after prolonged hypoxia. Hypoxia was induced by incubating cells at 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide for 4 h prior to irradiation. The out-of-field response in MDA231 cells was oxygen dependent and therefore selected for co-culture studies to determine the signaling kinetics at different time intervals after irradiation under oxic and hypoxic conditions. Under both oxic and hypoxic conditions, significant increases in cell survival were observed in-field with significant decreases in survival observed out-of-field (P < 0.05), which were dependent on intercellular communication. The in-field response of MDA231 cells showed no significant time dependency up to 24 h postirradiation, while out-of-field survival decreased significantly during the first 6 h postirradiation (P < 0.05). While in-field responses were oxygen dependent, out-of-field effects were observed to be independent of oxygen, with similar or greater cell killing under hypoxic conditions. This study provides further understanding of intercellular signaling under hypoxic conditions and highlights the need for further refinement of established radiobiological models for future applications in advanced radiotherapies.",Excluded,0.9728127

The authors examined nine AVM specimens obtained 10 months to more than 5 years after GKRS, by using routine histopathological stains as well as immunohistochemical techniques to detect smooth-muscle actin, factor VIII, and type IV collagen. Blood vessels within the AVMs showed progressive changes leading to narrowing or obliteration of the lumen. The earliest changes after gamma knife irradiation appear to be damage to endothelial cells, followed by progressive thickening of the intimal layer caused by proliferation of smooth-muscle cells that elaborate an extracellular matrix that includes type IV collagen. Finally, cellular degeneration and hyaline transformation occur. For statistical correlation analyses, the specimens were graded according to the degree of histopathological change and the relative number of vessels showing such changes. Both of these parameters were significantly correlated with time after GKRS and with AVM size reduction shown on follow-up imaging studies. Gamma knife radiosurgery of AVMs causes endothelial damage, which induces the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells and the elaboration of extracellular collagen by these cells, which leads to progressive stenosis and obliteration of the AVM nidus. This series of pathological changes in AVMs after GKRS is essentially similar to the response-to-injury model of atherosclerosis.",Excluded,0.9722181
835,"Do non-thermal electromagnetic fields cause nitrosative stress in male and female rats? Nitrosative stress occurs when the generations of highly Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) exceed the ability of the human body to neutralize and eliminate them. It may lead to nitrosylation reactions that can alter protein structure by inhibiting normal body functions. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether RF Fields at non - thermal level can affect total NO (NOx) and antioxidant levels in plasma thus cause nitrosative stress. Twenty-four male and female Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Group I and Group II: male (n=6) and female (n=6) control groups, Group III and Group IV: male (n=6) and female (n=6) RF radiation exposed groups. The exposed groups of rats were exposed to non - thermal RF radiation 20 min/day for a month. NOx (nitrite/nitrate) levels were measured by Griess assay using Elisa reader. The total sulfhydryl (RSH) levels were determined spectrophotometrically by Kurtel method. The exposure to RF Radiation for a month caused significant increase in NOx plasma levels in male and female rats (p < 0.05). Conversely RSH levels were significantly lower in exposed rats compared to control rats (p < 0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed in the rectal temperature between control and RF - irradiated rats (p > 0.05). In the present study, we showed that plasma NOx level may be increased in both male and female rats due to RF radiation exposure. The results of our study are evident that RF Fields at non - thermal level can induce nitrosative stress by increasing NOx and decreasing antioxidant levels.",Excluded,0.97184753
995,"Cytogenetic and molecular characterization of plutonium-induced rat osteosarcomas The association between ionizing radiation and the subsequent development of osteosarcoma has been well described, but little is known about the cytogenetic and molecular events, which could be involved in the formation of radiation-induced osteosarcomas. Here, we performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to detect chromosomal copy number changes in a series of 16 rat osteosarcomas induced by injection of plutonium-238. Recurrent gains/amplifications were observed at chromosomal regions 3p12-q12, 3q41-qter, 4q41-qter, 6q12-q16, 7q22-q34, 8q11-q23, 9q11-q22, 10q32.1-qter, and 12q, whereas recurrent losses were observed at 1p, 1q, 3q23-q35, 5q21-q33, 8q24-q31, 10q22-q25, 15p, 15q, and 18q. The gained region at 7q22-q34 was homologous to human chromosome bands 12q13-q15/8q24/22q11-q13, including the loci of Mdm2, Cdk4, c-Myc and Pdgf-b genes. The lost regions at 5q21-q33, 10q22-q25 and 15q contained tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4a/p19ARF, Tp53 and Rb1. To identify potential target gene(s) for the chromosomal aberrations, we compared the expression levels of several candidate genes, located within the regions of frequent chromosomal aberrations, between the tumors and normal osteoblasts by using quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The Cdk4, c-Myc, Pdgf-b and p57KIP2 genes were thought to be possible target genes for the frequent chromosomal gain at 7q22-34 and loss at 1q in the tumors, respectively. In addition, mutations of the Tp53 gene were found in 27% (4 of 15) osteosarcomas. Our data may contribute to further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying osteosarcomas induced by ionizing radiation in human.",Excluded,0.97172797
432,"DNA alterations detected in the progeny of paternally irradiated Japanese medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) A nonmammalian test system for germ-cell mutagenesis has been developed by using the Japanese medaka fish. We describe a system for detecting DNA alterations in F1 progeny descended from the gamma-irradiated male medaka that uses an arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction and fingerprinting. A combination of these two methods has some advantages for screening changes in genomic DNA of individual progeny because this detection system can (i) screen for mutational events before embryos with dominant lethal mutations are eliminated during development and (ii) detect DNA changes in the progeny of irradiated males without functional selection and bias, such as resistance to chemicals. DNA alterations are detected as changes in patterns (i.e., band loss and/or band gain) of DNA fingerprints of progeny descended from males whose spermatozoa or spermatids were gamma-irradiated (4.75 or 9.50 Gy). We determined the frequency of gamma-irradiation-induced band loss in arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction fingerprints of DNA from severely malformed embryos with dominant lethal mutations and hatched viable embryos. The frequency of band loss in both dominant lethal embryos and hatched viable embryos increased with increasing gamma-ray dose, although more so in the former. We detected a new band in the fingerprints as a heritable DNA alteration but not a viability- or phenotype-affecting DNA alteration in two viable mutants recovered after gamma-irradiation experiments. A cloned amplified fragment of the new band contained a repeated sequence of p(ATGT)n.",Excluded,0.97172654

The tests such as 9-day bone marrow cellularity (BMC) and endogenous CFUs, the neutrophile number restoration, the 30-day survival index have shown that all three preparations have an approximately equal effectiveness relating to acute radiation disease treatment and granulopoiesis stimulation after a 5-10 day consecutive administration following irradiation of mice at lethal and sublethal doses.

IL-5 participates as well in the induction and regulation of IgE and eosinophilia, consequently in the development of acquired immunity. Swiss Webster female mice were subcutaneously injected with either 50 microg of gamma-irradiated cercarial homogenate (400 Gy) twice weekly for three weeks alone or plus a single dose of IL-12 (0.8 ng/Kg). The efficiency of immunization regimens were assessed 45 days post infection with 100 live cercariae/mouse by the number of worm burden, ova count, production of IL-5, eosinophils, and IgE levels in the vaccinated groups compared with the non-immunized group. The results demonstrated a significant reduction of ova count in the livers of vaccinated groups (57.19 and 40.13%) and worm couples compared with the non -immunized group. Furthermore, a decrease of IL-5 level as well as eosinopenia was recorded in both vaccinated groups.

282,"Isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis by use of 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine-treated cells Irradiated McCoy cells have provided a useful technique for the isolation of Chlamydia trachomatis strains, among which are found the etiological agents of trachoma, inclusion conjunctivitis, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Because irradiation is not always readily available, 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine (IUDR) treatment of cells was investigated as a substitute procedure. IUDR-treated cells were found to be as sensitive to C. trachomatis infection as were irradiated McCoy cells. Stock chlamydial strains gave similar titers of iodine-stained inclusions in either system. When cells treated with IUDR were compared with irradiated cells for the isolation of C. trachomatis from clinical specimens, 5 of 138 specimens yielded isolates in IUDR-treated cells not found in irradiated ones, and one isolate was obtained from irradiated but not from IUDR-treated cells. In those 56 cases where inclusions were seen in both systems, there were significantly more inclusions in IUDR-treated than in irradiated cells. Although this series of cultures is too small to determine whether IUDR-treated cells are superior to irradiated ones for the isolation of C. trachomatis, the data indicate that IUDR treatment is at least equally effective.",Excluded,0.9712861
846,"31P NMR spectroscopy can predict the optimum interval between fractionated irradiation doses This study was performed to clarify whether changes in the metabolites observed by phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) could indicate an optimum interval between two doses of radiation in a murine tumor model. Murine mammary carcinoma cells, FM3A, were irradiated 7 days after transplantation with a single 5 Gy dose without anesthesia. 31P spectra were measured with a spectrometer up to 30 days. The beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi values were calculated from the peak area of each spectrum. In a fractionation experiment, two fractions of irradiation at a 5 Gy per fraction were given at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 6 day intervals. Tumor growth delay was also scored to determine the fractionated radiation effect. In the control group, beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi decreased with tumor growth. In the single irradiation group, the tumor did not grow up to day 6, and an initial rise and subsequent decrease in beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed. Maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were observed on day 2 after irradiation. In a fractionation experiment, the greatest growth delay was observed in the two day interval group, in which maximum beta-ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi were demonstrated in 31P-MRS. Our results suggested that changes in the metabolites observed by 31P-MRS could be useful indicators for determining the fractionation schedule in radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.9711274
954,"The impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples measured by the comet assay The comet assay is frequently used in human biomonitoring for the detection of exposure to genotoxic agents. Peripheral blood samples are most frequently used and tested either as whole blood or after isolation of lymphocytes (i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC). To investigate a potential impact of lymphocyte isolation on induced DNA damage in human blood samples, we exposed blood ex vivo to mutagens with different modes of genotoxic action. The comet assay was performed either directly with whole blood at the end of the exposure period or with lymphocytes isolated directly after exposure. In addition to the recommended standard protocol for lymphocyte isolation, a shortened protocol was established to optimise the isolation procedure. The results indicate that the effects of induced DNA strand breaks and alkali-labile sites induced by ionising radiation and alkylants, respectively, are significantly reduced in isolated lymphocytes. In contrast, oxidative DNA base damage (induced by potassium bromate) and stable bulky adducts (induced by benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide; BPDE) seem to be less affected. Our findings suggest that in vivo-induced DNA damage might also be reduced in isolated lymphocytes in comparison with the whole blood depending of the types of DNA damage induced. Because only small genotoxic effects can generally be expected in human biomonitoring studies with the comet assay after occupational and environmental exposure to genotoxic agents, any loss might be relevant and should be avoided. The possibility of such effects and their potential impact on variability of comet assay results in human biomonitoring should be considered when performing or evaluating such kind of studies.

Regularity of the stem cell cloning in the bone marrow was analogous to such in the spleen. Radiosensitivity of the colony-forming units (CFU) differed depending on the site (the spleen, the bone marrow) of their colony formation. The CFU settling in the marrow proved to be more radioresistant (D(0) equalled 160-200 P) in comparison with the CFU settling in the spleen (D(0) constituted 80-100 P). It is supposed that a different radiosensitivity of the CFU was caused by the presence of heterogenic population of the stem cells and also by specific peculiarities of the organ (the spleen, the bone marrow) in which the colonies formed.",Excluded,0.96911556

Collect 26Adult healthy tree shrews, male and female half and half. 20 tree shrews were selected randomly into 2 groups the control group and the experimental groups. The control group for the negative control group were given only saline. The experimental group was divided into two groups the irradiaton group and cyclophosphamide group. 3 subgroups (R1 R2 R3) in the irradiation group, were given 6Gy, 8Gy, 10Gy irradiation by electron accelerator respectively. Cyclophosphamide group were treated with cyclophosphamide for immunosuppressive treatment. Each group were implanted with tumor cell suspension. Observe the survival of tree shrew and tumor situation to select the best experimental conditions for Tree shrew lung cancer model. Result(s): 1. The immune suppressed tree shrews which treated by Electron accelerator radiation processing were activities reduced, slow, inactive, eating less, and even antifeedant. After tree shrews inoculated tumor cell suspension 2 days, the tumor growth can be seeing. Tumor was growth rapidly and tumor nodules became maximum at the 3rd week, after which tumor was growth slow and some nodules were narrowing. Blood cell analysis and thrombocyte counting showed that significant bone marrow suppression appeared in tree shrews after irradiation. It recovered after 1 week and white cell count near normal at the 3rd week. P value >0.05 and indicted immune system had recovered. 2. The tree shrews which immunosuppressive treated by cyclophosphamide were like the tree shrews treated by electron accelerator radiation. Those animals had high mortality and had no tumor nodule growth during the experiment. 3.

Recent combat applications of DU alloy [i.e., Persian Gulf War (PGW) and Kosovo peacekeeping objective] resulted in human acute exposure to DU dust, vapor or aerosol, as well as chronic exposure from tissue embedding of DU shrapnel fragments. DU alloy is 99.8% 238Uranium, and emits approximately 60% of the alpha, beta, and gamma radiation found in natural uranium (4.05 x 10(-7) Ci/g DU alloy). DU is a heavy metal that is 160% more dense than lead and can remain within the body for many years and slowly solubilize. High levels of urinary uranium have been measured in PGW veterans 10 years after exposure to DU fragments and vapors. In rats, there is strong evidence of DU accumulation in tissues including testes, bone, kidneys, and brain. In vitro tests indicate that DU alloy may be both genotoxic and mutagenic, whereas a recent in vivo study suggests that tissue-embedded DU alloy may be carcinogenic in rats. There is limited available data for reproductive and teratological deficits from exposure to uranium per se, typically from oral, respiratory, or dermal exposure routes. Alternatively, there is no data available on the reproductive effects of DU embedded. This paper reviews published studies of reproductive toxicity in humans and animals from uranium or DU exposure, and discusses ongoing animal research to evaluate reproductive effects in male and female rats embedded with DU fragments, and possible consequences in F1 and F2 generations.",Excluded,0.96780884

Therefore, Mantel-Haenszel techniques were used to estimate the independent effects of (a) exposure age and (b) number of films. Age at exposure had a clearly significant effect; x-rays taken in the first trimester of pregnancy were 2.69 times as effective as x-rays taken in the third trimester. First trimester exposure were often the result of maternal illnesses so these maternal illnesses were then included among the controlling factors. When this was done the first trimester x-rays were 2.73 times as effective as later exposures. First trimester x-rays were most strongly associated with the cancers which were diagnosed between 4 and 5 years of age.

250,"Environmental exposure to pyrethroids and sperm sex chromosome disomy: a cross-sectional study BACKGROUND: The role of environmental pesticide exposures, such as pyrethroids, and their relationship to sperm abnormalities are not well understood. This study investigated whether environmental exposure to pyrethroids was associated with altered frequency of sperm sex chromosome disomy in adult men.
METHODS: A sample of 75 subjects recruited through a Massachusetts infertility clinic provided urine and semen samples. Individual exposures were measured as urinary concentrations of three pyrethroid metabolites ((3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), cis- and trans- 3-(2,2-Dichlorovinyl)-1-methylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (CDCCA and TDCCA)). Multiprobe fluorescence in situ hybridization for chromosomes X, Y, and 18 was used to determine XX, YY, XY, 1818, and total sex chromosome disomy in sperm nuclei. Poisson regression analysis was used to examine the association between aneuploidy rates and pyrethroid metabolites while adjusting for covariates.
RESULTS: Between 25-56% of the sample were above the limit of detection (LOD) for the pyrethroid metabolites. All sex chromosome disomies were increased by 7-30% when comparing men with CDCCA and TDCCA levels above the LOD to those below the LOD. For 3PBA, compared to those below the LOD, those above the LOD had YY18 disomy rates 1.28 times higher (95% CI: 1.15, 1.42) whereas a reduced rate was seen for XY18 and total disomy (IRR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87; IRR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-0.97), and no association was seen for XX18 and 1818.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that urinary concentrations of CDCCA and TDCCA above the LOD were associated with increased rates of aneuploidy. However the findings for 3BPA were not consistent. This is the first study to examine these relationships, and replication of our findings is needed before the association between pyrethroid metabolites and aneuploidy can be fully defined.",Excluded,0.9661708

Both mast cell progenitors (MCp) and mature mast cells express these cell surface markers, and ways validated to distinguish between the two maturation forms with flow cytometry have been lacking. Here, we show that primary peritoneal MCp from naive mice expressed high levels of integrin beta7 and had a low side scatter (SSC) light profile; whereas mature mast cells expressed lower levels of integrin beta7 and had a high SSC light profile. The maturation statuses of the cells were confirmed using three main strategies: (1) MCp, but not mature mast cells, were shown to be depleted by sublethal whole-body gamma-irradiation. (2) The MCp were small and immature in terms of granule formation, whereas the mature mast cells were larger and had fully developed metachromatic granules. (3) The MCp had fewer transcripts of mast cell-specific proteases and the enzyme responsible for sulfation of heparin than mature mast cells. Moreover, isolated peritoneal MCp gave rise to mast cells when cultured in vitro. To summarize, we have defined MCp and mature mast cells in naive mice by flow cytometry.

In Nagasaki, approximately 1,200 km away from Fukushima, the internal radioactivity in evacuees and short-term visitors to Fukushima has been measured by a whole body counter (WBC) since March 15, 2011. A horizontal bed-type scanning WBC equipped with two NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors was used for 173 people who stayed in the Fukushima prefecture between March 11 and April 10, 2011. The average length of stay was 4.8 days. The internal radioactivity was converted to an estimated amount of intake according to the scenario of acute inhalation, and then the committed effective dose and the thyroid dose were evaluated. 131I, 134Cs and 137Cs were detected in more than 30% of examined individuals. In subjects who stayed in Fukushima from March 12 to March 18, the detection rate was approximately 50% higher for each radionuclide and 44% higher for all three nuclides.

646,"Ex vivo radiosensitivity is increased in non-cancer patients taking valproate BACKGROUND: Valproate (VPA) is a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug for patients experiencing epileptic seizures due to brain tumors. VPA increases radiation sensitivity in various tumor cells in vitro due to complex mechanisms. This could make tumors more vulnerable to ionizing radiation or overcome radioresistance. Yet, clinical data on possible improvement of tumor control by adding VPA to tumor therapy is controversial. Potentially radiosensitizing effects of VPA on healthy tissue remain unclear. To determine individual radiosensitivity, we analyzed blood samples of individuals taking VPA., METHODS: Ex vivo irradiated blood samples of 31 adult individuals with epilepsy were studied using 3-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. Aberrations in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 were analyzed. Radiosensitivity was determined by the mean breaks per metaphase (B/M) and compared to age-matched (2:1) healthy donors., RESULTS: The patient cohort (n = 31; female: 38.7%) showed an increase of their average B/M value compared to healthy individuals (n = 61; female: 56.9%; B/M: 0.480 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.415 +/- 0.07; p = .001). The portion of radiosensitive (B/M > 0.500) and distinctly radiosensitive individuals (B/M > 0.600) was increased in the VPA group (54.9% vs. 11.3 and 9.7% vs. 0.0%; p < .001). In 3/31 patients, radiosensitivity was determined prior to and after VPA treatment and radiosensitivity was increased by VPA-treatment., CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we confirmed that patients treated with VPA had an increased radiosensitivity compared to the control group.

632,"Radiation exposure of patients and staff working in angiography and interventional radiology unit Catheter angiography and interventional radiologic procedures are the medical applications with the highest exposure to radiation. The projection used, in other words the irradiated region of the patient, constantly changes and the change in irradiation geometry due to the movements of the image amplifier is another important factor. Irradiation can be achieved in the form of continuous (fluoroscopic) or sequential static images (filming). In these irradiations the kVp, mA and irradiation time of the system change continuously depending on the patient thickness. The aim of this study was to determine the dose of radiation the staff working in Angiography and Interventional Radiology unit and the patients undergoing intervention were exposed to and to discuss the measures to decrease the dose of radiation. In this study, the dose values of 129 patients and three physicians and two radiotechnologists working in the unit were determined. In order to evaluate the radiation doses of the employees, radiation doses were measured with Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dosimeters over a period of six months. Doses of the patients during the procedure were measured separately. Total bimonthly and annual dose amounts were determined for the physicians as chest (collar), belt and wrist with the help of OSL dosimeters. Likewise, total bimonthly and annual dose amounts of radiotechnologists were measured as breast (neck) and belt. It was found that the duration of fluoroscopy was 2-3 times higher in radiological procedures than in diagnostic angiography and therefore the patient and radiologist were exposed to more radiation. The exposure radiation dose can be significantly decreased by reducing the number of frames per second during both fluoroscopy and filming.Copyright © 2020 OMU",Excluded,0.96412516
1017,"Immune events associated with protection in C57BL/6 mice immunized with anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking protective antigens shared between gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model of Schistosoma haematobium Immunoregulation is central for successful manipulation of schistosomiasis. Unlike schistosome vaccine development strategies that relied on direct selection of antigens from crude responses leading to selection of mildly protective antigens, the present study tested the utility of selection of potentially protective antigens encompassed rounds of immunoregulation via idiotypic network. Anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) were purified from sera of New Zealand white rabbits multiply immunized with gamma-irradiated cercariae of S. haematobium, using adult worm specific idiotypes (Ab1) purified from sera of subjects resistant to reinfection. Ab2 was used for immunization of C57BL/6 mice and consequences of immunization were monitored before and after challenge infection with S. haematobium. Results showed an increase of splenic T cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) upon immunization (average % stimulated cells 54.9 vs. 20.4, P < 0.05 for ICAM-1 and 31.1 vs. 6.6, P < 0.01 for VLA-4) and challenge, especially at day 6 (83.5 vs. 45.6, P < 0.01) for ICAM-1 and day 10 (50.4 vs. 20.8, P < 0.05) for VLA-4. Thereafter, both adhesion molecules declined at day 28 through 90. Similarly, lymphoproliferation was manifested upon immunization (OD570-630 0.27 vs. 0.09, P < 0.01) and challenge at day 6 (0.5 vs. 0.17, P < 0.01) through day 10 (0.49 vs.0.18, P < 0.05), then declined at day 28 through 90. Moreover, sera of Ab2-immunized mice exhibited an anti-anti-ids (Ab3) reactivity against antigens of approximate molecular weight 40, 80 and 160 kDa of adult worms, which were also recognized by Ab1. However, in contrast to Ab1, Ab3 showed no surface binding to 3 hr schistosomula. Strikingly, mice immunized with Ab2 showed strong resistance to challenge infection (approximately 82% reduction in worm burden, P < 0.001). Taking all, this alternative vaccine development strategy appears to filter out non-protective antigens. Indeed Ab3 recognizes much fewer numbers of antigens, which passed through two rounds of immune regulation. These antigens appear to represent a significant proportion of the protective response in the gamma-irradiated cercariae vaccine and human resistance model as well, providing the basis for an alternative vaccine for schistosomiasis.",Excluded,0.9639162

A matched case-control study was conducted using those who died of NPC during the period 1987-1995. Two controls were randomly selected for each case from those who died from causes other than malignancies and external causes. Cases and their controls were matched with respect to sex and the years of birth and death (+/- 5 years). Study subjects' next-of-kin were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire to collect information on socioeconomic status, dietary habits, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption, disease history, pesticide use, medical X-ray exposure, the family history of NPC and so on. We succeeded in interviewing 97 cases and 192 controls. Univariate conditional logistic regression analysis showed that NPC risk was associated with the consumption of salted fish, homemade pickles, and fermented soy beans, education levels, the history of chronic rhinitis, and the family history of NPC. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that education levels (Odds ratio (OR) for middle school or higher levels vs. no school education = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.2 to 11.8), salted fish intake (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.7 to 6.1), the history of chronic rhinitis (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.3 to 10.1), and the family history of NPC (OR = 14.2, 95% CI = 2.7 to 73.4) were independent risk factors of NPC. Tobacco smoking (OR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7 to 2.1), and alcohol consumption (OR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5 to 1.9) were not significantly related to NPC risk. The ORs of NPC risk comparing HBRA and a nearby control area before and after adjustment for the major risk determinants identified in the present study were 0.86 (95% CI = 0.50 to 1.50) and 0.87 (95% CI = 0.45 to 1.67), respectively. Salted fish intake was a strong risk factor of NPC. Education, the history of chronic rhinitis and the family history of NPC were also related to NPC risk. The exposure to high background radiation in HBRA of Yangjiang was not related to NPC risk with or without the adjustment for those major risk determinants of NPC.",Excluded,0.9626375
1090,"In vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts can identify a group of radiotherapy patients having developed complications in a variety of normal tissues Purpose. - A retrospective study of the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe complications. Patients and methods. - Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. Results. - The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). Conclusion. - The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy.",Excluded,0.96107405
966,"Long-term in vitro and in vivo effects of gamma-irradiated BCG on innate and adaptive immunity BCG vaccination is associated with a reduced mortality from nonmycobacterial infections. This is likely to be mediated by a combination of innate-immune memory (trained immunity"") and heterologous effects on adaptive immunity. As such, BCG could be used to boost host immunity but not in immunocompromised hosts, as it is a live, attenuated vaccine. Therefore, we assessed whether killed gammaBCG has similar potentiating effects. In an in vitro model of trained immunity, human monocytes were incubated with gammaBCG for 24 h and restimulated after 6 d. Cytokine production and the role of pattern recognition receptors and histone methylation markers were assessed. The in vivo effects of gammaBCG vaccination were studied in a proof-of-principle trial in 15 healthy volunteers. gammaBCG induced trained immunity in vitro via the NOD2 receptor pathway and up-regulation of H3K4me3 histone methylation. However, these effects were less strong than those induced by live BCG. gammaBCG vaccination in volunteers had only minimal effects on innate immunity, whereas a significant increase in heterologous Th1/Th17 immunity was observed. Our results indicate that gammaBCG induces long-term training of innate immunity in vitro. In vivo, gammaBCG induces mainly heterologous effects on the adaptive-immune system, whereas effects on innate cytokine production are limited.

644,"Background radiation impacts human longevity and cancer mortality: reconsidering the linear no-threshold paradigm The current linear no-threshold paradigm assumes that any exposure to ionizing radiation carries some risk, thus every effort should be made to maintain the exposures as low as possible. We examined whether background radiation impacts human longevity and cancer mortality. Our data covered the entire US population of the 3139 US counties, encompassing over 320 million people. This is the first large-scale study which takes into account the two major sources of background radiation (terrestrial radiation and cosmic radiation), covering the entire US population. Here, we show that life expectancy, the most integrative index of population health, was approximately 2.5 years longer in people living in areas with a relatively high vs. low background radiation. (>= 180 mrem/year and <= 100 mrem/year, respectively; p < 0.005; 95% confidence interval [CI]). This radiation-induced lifespan extension could to a great extent be associated with the decrease in cancer mortality rate observed for several common cancers (lung, pancreas and colon cancers for both genders, and brain and bladder cancers for males only; p < 0.05; 95% CI). Exposure to a high background radiation displays clear beneficial health effects in humans. These hormetic effects provide clear indications for re-considering the linear no-threshold paradigm, at least within the natural range of low-dose radiation.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",Excluded,0.9570639

They were treated by radical radiotherapy for variety of tumors, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, glottic larynx, anal canal, cervix, bladder, thyroid gland, and tonsil pillar. Five patients did not develop any significant late reactions (normally sensitive group, NS). The other five developed late complications in different normal tissues and organs that proved to be fatal in one patient (clinically hyper-sensitive group, HS). Fibroblast cultures were established from punch skin biopsy and radiosensitivity in vitro was measured. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) was calculated and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: SF2 ranged between 0.10 and 0.38 with a mean of 0.24. The mean SF2 for each of the NS and the HS groups were 0.31 and 0.17, respectively. The non-parametric rank test of Mann-Whitney shows that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant (p = 0.01)., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts is correlated with late complications in different organs and normal tissues following radiotherapy for variety of tumors.

LNs inside the irradiation field are affected by CRT, whereas those outside the irradiation field are affected only by concurrent chemotherapy., PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study cohort comprised of 210 patients with clinical stage II/III rectal adenocarcinoma. One hundred and eight received surgery alone (S group), and 102 received preoperative CRT (40 or 45 Gy) with concurrent oral UFT or S-1 uracil/tegafur or S-1 (CRT group)., RESULTS: The number of LNs inside the irradiation field was significantly smaller in the CRT group (4 +/- 4) than in the S group (6 +/- 6, p<0.01), but the number of LNs outside the irradiation field did not differ (5 +/- 4 in both groups). The longest diameters of LNs in the S group were significantly smaller than those of the CRT group both inside and outside the irradiation fields (p<0.01)., CONCLUSION: The effects of CRT on LNs in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma differed inside and outside the radiation field.

930,"Effect of Hypercapnia, an Element of Obstructive Respiratory Disorders, on Pancreatic Cancer Chemoresistance and Progression BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive respiratory disorders (ORD) are linked to increased rates of cancer related deaths. Little is known about the effects of hypercapnia (elevated CO2) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development and drug-resistance.
STUDY DESIGN: Two PDAC cell-lines were exposed to normocapnic (5% CO2) and hypercapnic (continuous/intermittent 10% CO2) conditions, physiologically similar to patients with active ORD. Cells were assessed for proliferation rate, colony formation, and chemo/radiotherapeutic efficacy. In a retrospective clinical study design, patients with PDAC who have undergone pancreatic resection between the years of 2002-2014 were reviewed. Active smokers were excluded in order to remove possible smoking-related pro-tumorigenic influences. Clinical data, pathological findings, and survival endpoints were recorded. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Exposure to hypercapnia resulted in an increased colony formation and proliferation rate, in-vitro in both cell lines (MIA-PaCa-2:111% increase and Panc-1:114% increase, P<0.05). Hypercapnia exposure induced a 2.5-fold increase in oxaliplatin resistance (P<0.05) in both cell lines and increased resistance to ionizing radiation in MIA-PaCa-2 cells (P<0.05). Five hundred and seventy-eight patients were included [52% males, median age was 68.7 years (IQR 60.6-76.8 years)]. Cox regression analysis, assessing TNM-staging, age, gender and ORD status, identified ORD as an independent risk factor for both overall survival (HR 1.64, 95%CI 1.2-2.3, P<0.05) and disease-free survival (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.06-2.67).
CONCLUSIONS: PDAC cells exposed to hypercapnic environments, common to patients with ORD, showed tumor proliferation, radioresistance and chemoresistance. Patients with a history of ORD had a worse overall prognosis, suggesting that hypercapnic conditions play a role in the development and progression of PDAC and stressing the need for patient-tailored care.",Excluded,0.95451725

Methods We followed a cohort of 7033 Hodgkin disease patients who were treated in Britain from November 1, 1967, through September 30, 2000, and compared their risk of myocardial infarction mortality with that in the general population of England and Wales. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 166 deaths from myocardial infarction occurred in the cohort, statistically significantly more than expected(standardized mortality ratio[SMR] = 2.5, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 2.1 to 2.9), with an absolute excess risk of 125.8 per 100000 person-years. Standardized mortality ratios decreased sharply with older age at first treatment, but absolute excess risks of death from myocardial infarction increased with older age up to age 65 years at first treatment. The statistically significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction mortality persisted through to 25 years after first treatment. Risks were increased statistically significantly and independently for patients who had been treated with supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy, anthracyclines, or vincristine. Risk was particularly high for patients treated with the doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine regimen(SMR = 9.5, 95% CI = 3.5 to 20.6). Risk at 20 or more years after first treatment was particularly great for patients who had received supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy and vincristine without anthracylines(SMR = 14.8, 95% CI = 4.8 to 34.5). Conclusions The risk of death from myocardial infarction after treatment for Hodgkin disease remains high for at least 25 years. The increased risks are related to supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy but may also be related to anthracycline and vincristine treatment.",Excluded,0.9541038
608,"Telomere length in human adults and high level natural background radiation BACKGROUND: Telomere length is considered as a biomarker of aging, stress, cancer. It has been associated with many chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Although, telomere shortening due to ionizing radiation has been reported in vitro, no in vivo data is available on natural background radiation and its effect on telomere length. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present investigation is an attempt to determine the telomere length among human adults residing in high level natural radiation areas (HLNRA) and the adjacent normal level radiation areas (NLNRA) of Kerala coast in Southwest India. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 310 individuals (HLNRA: N = 233 and NLNRA: N = 77). Telomere length was determined using real time q-PCR. Both telomere (T) and single copy gene (S) specific primers were used to calculate the relative T/S and expressed as the relative telomere length. The telomere length was determined to be 1.22+/-0.15, 1.12+/-0.15, 1.08+/-0.08, 1.12+/-0.11, respectively, among the four dose groups (</=1.50, 1.51-3.00, 3.01-5.00 and >5.00 mGy per year), which did not show any dose response. The results suggested that the high level natural chronic radiation did not have significant effect on telomere length among young adult population living in HLNRA, which is indicative of better repair of telomeric ends. No significant difference in telomere length was observed between male and female individuals. In the present investigation, although the determination of telomere length was studied among the adults with an age group between 18 to 40 years (mean maternal age: 26.10+/-4.49), a negative correlation was observed with respect to age. However, inter-individual variation was (0.81-1.68) was clearly observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this preliminary investigation, we conclude that elevated level of natural background radiation has no significant effect on telomere length among the adult population residing in HLNRAs of Kerala coast. To our knowledge, this is the first report from HLNRAs of the world where telomere length was determined on human adults. However, more samples from each background dose group and samples from older population need to be studied to derive firm conclusions.",Excluded,0.9538388
703,"Special proliferative sites are not needed for seeding and proliferation of transfused bone marrow cells in normal syngeneic mice The widely held view that transfused bone marrow cells will not proliferate in normal mice, not exposed to irradiation or other forms of bone marrow ablation, was reinvestigated. Forty million bone marrow cells from male donors were given to female recipients on each of 5 consecutive days, 5 to 10 times the number customarily used in the past. When the recipients were examined 2-13 weeks after the last transfusion, donor cells were found to average 16-25% of total marrow cells. Similar percentages of donor cells were found when variants of the enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase determined electrophoretically were used for identification of donor and recipient cells. Evidence is presented that the proportion of donor cells is compatible with a linear dependence on the number of cells transfused over the range tested--i.e., 20-200 million bone marrow cells injected intravenously. Special proliferative sites thus do not appear to be required.",Excluded,0.95345145
952,"RadRAT: a radiation risk assessment tool for lifetime cancer risk projection Risk projection methods allow for timely assessment of the potential magnitude of radiation-related cancer risks following low-dose radiation exposures. The estimation of such risks directly through observational studies would generally require infeasibly large studies and long-term follow-up to achieve reasonable statistical power. We developed an online radiation risk assessment tool (RadRAT) which can be used to estimate the lifetime risk of radiation-related cancer with uncertainty intervals following a user-specified exposure history (https://irep.nci.nih.gov/radrat). The uncertainty intervals constitute a key component of the program because of the various assumptions that are involved in such calculations. The risk models used in RadRAT are broadly based on those developed by the BEIR VII committee for estimating lifetime risk following low-dose radiation exposure of the US population for eleven site-specific cancers. We developed new risk models for seven additional cancer sites, oral, oesophagus, gallbladder, pancreas, rectum, kidney and brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancers, using data from Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The lifetime risk estimates are slightly higher for RadRAT than for BEIR VII across all exposure ages mostly because the weighting of the excess relative risk and excess absolute risk models was conducted on an arithmetic rather than a logarithmic scale. The calculator can be used to estimate lifetime cancer risk from both uniform and non-uniform doses that are acute or chronic. It is most appropriate for low-LET radiation doses < 1 Gy, and for individuals with life-expectancy and cancer rates similar to the general population in the US.",Excluded,0.9513202

Exclusion criteria included doses of radiotherapy <30 or >80 Gy, or dose per fraction >200 or <180 cGy. Recursive partitioning analysis and spline models were used to select dose thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to validate thresholds with respect to overall survival., RESULTS: Recursive partitioning analysis models defined a threshold of 57 Gy for stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma, above which 3-year overall survival rate was decreased (P < 0.0001). The 3-year overall survival rate for patients receiving 50.0-57.0 Gy (81.2%) was greater compared to doses of 30.0-49.9 Gy (75.3%) or >57.0 Gy (70%, P < 0.0001). Doses > 57.0 Gy were associated with an increased hazard of death (1.31, confidence interval 1.07-1.60) with respect to doses of 50.0-57.0 Gy. Doses < 50.0 Gy for stage III Merkel cell carcinoma were associated with worsened 3-year overall survival (P < 0.0001) and increased hazard of death (2.01, confidence interval 1.43-2.82) with respect to doses between 50.0 and 57.0 Gy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results support doses of 50-57 Gy for most patients with stage I/II Merkel cell carcinoma receiving conventionally-fractionated adjuvant radiotherapy. In contrast to a prior National Cancer Database analysis, our results suggest doses >= 50 Gy should be strongly considered for patients with stage III Merkel cell carcinoma regardless of anatomic subsite.

Previous studies have reported an increased risk of hip fracture among postmenopausal women with higher cystatin C, but there is a paucity of data in men and it is uncertain whether the association persists after adjustment for BMD. To test the hypothesis that older community-dwelling men with higher cystatin C are at increased risk of fracture, we conducted a case-cohort analysis in MrOS, a prospective study of 5994 men aged 65 years and older. We measured serum cystatin C in baseline serum specimens from all 435 men who experienced any non-vertebral fracture from baseline until February 2007 (average follow-up 4.7 years), all 168 men with first hip fracture from baseline until August 2010 (average follow-up 7.6 years), and a sample of 1602 men randomly selected from the cohort. Cystatin C was measured using a particle-enhanced immunonepholometric assay (inter- and intra-assay CV 3.1% and 2.8%, respectively). Fractures were confirmed with x-ray reports. Modified proportional hazards models were used to estimate the relative hazards (RH) of fracture in men across quartiles of cystatin C (cutpoints 0.80, 0.90, 1.03 mg/L). In a model adjusted for age, race, site and body mass index, higher cystatin C was not related to risk of nonvertebral fracture (p-trend 0.88), but was associated with an increased risk of hip fracture (RH (95% CI): 1.0 [Q1, referent group]; 0.9 (0.5-1.7) [Q2]; 1.1 (0.6-1.9) [Q3]; and 1.6 (0.9-2.8) [Q4]; p-trend 0.04). The majority of the effect of cystatin C on hip fracture was observed among men in Q4 who had a 1.6-fold (95% CI 1.1-2.3) increase in risk compared with men in Q1-3 (Table). Adding potential confounders (including fall history, prior fracture, prevalent cardiovascular disease, frailty status and total hip BMD) one at a time to the base model modestly attenuated the association, with frailty status having the greatest impact. After simultaneous adjustment for multiple confounders, the association no longer reached significance (RH (95% CI) Q4 versus Q1-3: 1.3 (0.9-1.9)). In conclusion, older men with higher serum cystatin C are at increased risk of hip (but not any nonvertebral) fracture. The association between cystatin C and hip fracture is due at least in part to the greater prevalence of frailty among men with higher cystatin C levels.",Excluded,0.9496727

Material(s) and Method(s): One hundred fifty-five patients with SCLC (limited stage, LSCLC, and extensive stage, ESCLC) participated in four phase II or III trials. Ninety-one patients received PCI (30. Gy/15 or 25. Gy/10) and 64 patients did not receive PCI. Survival was compared in a landmark analysis that included only patients who had stable disease or better in response to primary therapy. Result(s): Patients who received PCI had better survival than patients who did not receive PCI (median survival 12.0. months vs. 7.6. months, 3-year overall survival 13.2% vs. 3.1%, HR. =. 0.53 [95% CI 0.36-0.78], p=. 0.001). On multivariate analysis of the entire cohort, the only factor that remained significant for survival was stage (ESCLC vs. LSCLC, p=. 0.0072). In contrast, the multivariate analysis of patients who had ESCLC revealed that PCI was the sole factor associated with a survival advantage (HR. =. 0.47 [95% CI 0.24-0.93], p=. 0.03). Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were significantly greater in patients who received PCI (71.4% vs. 47.5%, p=. 0.0031), with non-neuro and non-heme being the specific AE categories most strongly correlated with PCI delivery. Conclusion(s): PCI was associated with a significant improvement in survival for our entire elderly SCLC patient cohort on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the survival advantage remained significant in patients with ESCLC. PCI was also associated with a modest increase in grade 3 or higher AEs.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Excluded,0.94911534

Controls (HCT survivors without CVD) were matched on age, year of HCT, type of HCT, and duration of follow-up. Sixty-three patients with late CVD were identified, 44 (69.8%) with a coronary artery event and 19 (30.2%) with a cerebrovascular event. Median age at HCT was 49.0 years. Median age at onset of late CVD was 54.0 years; 66.7% of the affected patients had undergone autologous HCT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors (2 or more of the following: obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) after HCT was associated with a 5.2-fold increased risk of late CVD (P < .01), and that pre-HCT chest radiation exposure was associated with a 9.5-fold greater risk of coronary artery disease (P = .03). Pre-HCT exposure to chest radiation and the presence of comorbidities were primarily responsible for the risk associated with late CVD after HCT. These data form the basis for developing predictive models for identifying high-risk individuals for targeted surveillance and aggressive management of comorbidities. © 2010 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.",Excluded,0.9490479
504,"Regulation of the metastasis of murine ocular melanoma by natural killer cells In the current study we examine parameters affecting the metastasis of ocular tumors of in vivo derived B16F10 melanoma. In C57BL/6J beige (bg/bg) mice, with low NK activity, metastasis to the lungs was increased and survival time decreased. In C57BL/6J normal (+/+) mice treatment with PK136, a highly specific monoclonal anti-NK antibody (Ab), caused a depletion of NK cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated using a standard 51Cr release assay. In animals bearing ocular tumors, treatment with PK136 Ab resulted in significantly increased pulmonary metastasis and an altered pattern of metastasis. The effect of combined treatment protocols using LS2616 (linomide) and cyclophosphamide (Cy) was examined in enucleated and unenucleated animals. Treatment with LS2616 and Cy resulted in a significant decrease in mean pulmonary metastases (MPM), a decreased frequency of metastasis to the submandibular lymph nodes and an increase in mean survival time. In enucleated mice this combined treatment protocol resulted in apparent cures, the lowest MPM and the longest survival time observed. When tumor-bearing mice were treated with either silica, carrageenan or sublethal gamma irradiation, no effect on metastasis or survival was observed. This study demonstrates the importance of the NK cell as a primary effector cell for the control of metastasis from in vivo derived ocular B16F10 melanoma.",Excluded,0.943828
55,"Environmental and occupational causes of cancer: new evidence 2005-2007 What do we currently know about the occupational and environmental causes of cancer? As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know. We repeat the call of ecologist Sandra Steingraber: From the right to know and the duty to inquire flows the obligation to act.""""",Excluded,0.9436837
351,"Radiation dose response estimation with emphasis on low dose range using restricted cubic splines: application to all solid cancer mortality data, 1950-2003, in atomic bomb survivors Using the all solid cancer mortality data set of the Life Span Study (LSS) cohort from 1950 to 2003 (LSS Report 14) data among atomic bomb survivors, excess relative risk (ERR) statistical analyses were performed using the second degree polynomial and the threshold and restricted cubic spline (RCS) dose response models. For the RCS models with 3 to 7 knots of equally spaced percentiles with margins in the dose range greater than 50 mGy, the dose response was assumed to be linear at less than 70 to 90 mGy. Due to the skewed dose distribution of atomic bomb survivors, the current knot system for the RCS analysis results in a detailed depiction of the dose response as less than approximately 0.5 Gy. The 6 knot RCS models for the all-solid cancer mortality dose response of the whole dose or less than 2 Gy were selected with the AIC model selection criterion and fit significantly better (p < 0.05) than the linear (L) model. The usual RCS includes the L-global model but not the quadratic (Q) nor linear-quadratic (LQ) global models. The authors extended the RCS to include L or LQ global models by putting L or LQ constraints on the cubic spline in the lower and upper tails, and the best RCS model selected with AIC criterion was the usual RCS with L-constraints in both the lower and upper tails. The selected RCS had a linear dose-response model in the lower dose range (i.e., < 0.2-0.3 Gy) and was compatible with the linear no-threshold (LNT) model in this dose range. The proposed method is also useful in describing the dose response of a specific cancer or non-cancer disease incidence/mortality.",Excluded,0.94294643
751,"Lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the lifetime attributable risk of cancer from CT among patients surviving severe traumatic brain injury., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted with prospectively collected data on patients 16 years old and older admitted with a Glasgow coma scale score of 8 or less to a single level 1 trauma center from 2007 to 2010. The effective dose of each CT examination the patients underwent was predicted with literature-accepted effective dose values of standard helical CT protocols. The lifetime attributable risk of cancer and related mortality incurred as a result of CT were estimated with the cumulative effective dose incurred from the time of injury to a 1-year follow-up evaluation and with the approach established by the Biologic Effects of Ionizing Radiation VII report., RESULTS: The average patient was a 34-year-old man. The median number of CT examinations received during the first 12 months after injury was 20, and the average cumulative effective dose was 87 +/- 45 mSv. This resulted in increases in the lifetime incidence of all cancer types from 45.5% to 46.3% and in the lifetime incidence of cancer-related mortality from 22.1% to 22.5%., CONCLUSION: Radiation exposure from the use of CT in the evaluation and management of severe traumatic brain injury causes negligible increases in lifetime attributable risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. Treating physicians should not allow the concern for future risk of radiation-induced cancer to influence decisions regarding radiographic evaluation in the acute treatment of traumatic brain injury.",Excluded,0.9424141
745,"The effect of intensity-modulated radiotherapy on radiation-induced second malignancies PURPOSE: To compare intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in terms of carcinogenic risk for actual clinical scenarios., METHOD AND MATERIALS: Clinically equivalent IMRT plans were generated for prostate, breast, and head-and-neck cases treated with 3D-CRT. Two possible dose-response models for radiocarcinogenesis were generated based on A-bomb survivor data corrected for fractionation. Dose-volume histogram analysis was used to determine dose and its distribution to nontargeted tissues within the planning CT scan volume and thermoluminescent dosimetry for the rest of the body. Carcinogenic estimates were calculated with and without a correction factor accounting for cancer patients' advanced age and reduced longevity., RESULTS: For the model assuming a plateau in risk above 2-Gy single-fraction-equivalent (SFE), IMRT and 3D-CRT produced risks of 1.7% and 2.1%, respectively, for prostate; 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively, for nasopharynx; 1% each for tonsil; and 1.4-2.2% and 1.5-1.6%, respectively, depending on technique, for breast. Assuming a reduction in risk above 2-Gy SFE, risks for IMRT and 3D-CRT were 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, for prostate; 1.4% and 1.2%, respectively, for nasopharynx; 1% each for tonsil; and 1.3-1.8% vs. 1.3-1.6%, respectively, for breast. Applying a correction factor of 0.5 for cancer patients halved these risks and their relative differences., CONCLUSIONS: Carcinogenic risks were comparable in absolute terms between modalities. Risks are dependant on technique used. Risks with IMRT are influenced by monitor unit demand and are therefore software/hardware dependant. The dose-response model accounting for cell killing at higher doses fitted best with actual observed risks.",Excluded,0.93844074
46,"Individual radiosensitivity and correlation with tumoral regression Purpose/Objective(s): On the one hand, higher individual radiosensitivity increases the risk for side effects of radiotherapy, on the other hand it could also lead to improved tumor response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Our point of interest was the correlation of individual radiosensitivity (gH2AX as a reliable factor of radiosensitivity) and regression of the rectal cancer. Materials/Methods: We investigated a total of 22 patients (19 male, 3 female, all in stage T3 N0/N + M0) with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (RCT) followed by resection. Before treatment, 2ml of blood was collected, lymphocytes were isolated and irradiated with 2 Gy. After 24 hours, lymphocytes were stained with gH2AX antibodies. We compared our results with untreated lymphocytes of the same patient. At least 500 lymphocytes (and the included gammaH2AX -foci) were microscopically analyzed per patient. Subsequently, we statistically evaluated the correlation of the number of gammaH2AX foci (gammaH2AX as a sign for unrepaired DNA DSB), and tumor regression (RG) by Dworak et al. (RG 0 to 4; RG 0: no regression, RG 4: complete regression). Result(s): Five of 22 (23%) had a complete (RG 4), and 11 (50%) patients an almost complete tumoral regression (RG 3); However, 6 patients showed only a minor regression (RG1-2). In the untreated lymphocytes an average of 0.36 (+/- 0.21) foci was counted; after irradiation with 2 Gy and a 24 hour delay 2.25 Foci were still present. Tumoral regression (RG 3 + 4 vs. RG 0-2) correlated positively (p = 0.05) with the number of gammaH2AX-foci. However, regression did not correlate with other parameters such as age, weight, tumor size, dose and volume. Conclusion(s): In patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum there is an obvious positive correlation of remaining gH2AX foci in peripheral lymphocytes and histopathological regression of primary tumor. These findings could be an indication that patients of rectal cancer with increased radiosensitivity benefit of better response to neoadjuvant RCT.",Excluded,0.9362223
280,"Sorafenib acts synergistically in combination with radiotherapy without causing intestinal damage in colorectal cancer AIMS AND BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is one of the commonest cancers. Chemoradiotherapy gives better results than radiotherapy or chemotherapy in colorectal cancer. To enhance radiosensitivity of tumor cells for chemoradiotherapy, targeted therapy drugs that act as radiosensitizers can be used. In the present study, we provide a scientific rationale for the clinical application of sorafenib as a radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer, without causing significant adverse effects on normal intestinal tissue., METHODS: Three human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480) were treated with sorafenib alone, or radiation followed by sorafenib. In vitro tests were performed using colony forming assays, cell cycle analysis, and comet assays. In addition, the effects of sorafenib and radiation therapy on the inhibition HT-29 tumor growth and survival of intestinal jejunum crypts were examined in vivo., RESULTS: Sorafenib increased the radiosensitivity of tumor cells in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCT116, HT-29, and SW480), as well as in HT-29 xenograft animal models. Sorafenib, in combination with ionizing radiation, induced the accumulation of tumor cells in the G2-M phase and delayed the repair of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. The combination of sorafenib and ionizing radiation did not enhance the apoptosis of intestinal crypt cells, compared with the use of radiation alone., CONCLUSIONS: We provide a scientific rationale for the use of sorafenib in combination with radiotherapy in colorectal cancer.",Excluded,0.93430096
345,"Recovery kinetics in mouse skin and CaNT tumours Recovery kinetics and recovery capacity were studied in a fast proliferating normal tissue, skin, and in an anaplastic mouse mammary carcinoma, CaNT. Three fractions per day of X-rays, repeated over 5 days, were given at varying interfraction intervals from 0 to 8 h. The rate of recovery in tumours (t1/2 = 0.31 +/- 0.15 h for local control) was significantly faster than in skin (t1/2 = 0.96 +/- 0.10 h). By contrast, the fractionation sensitivity of CaNT tumours was less than that of skin (alpha/beta = 43.3 +/- 8.5 Gy vs. alpha/beta = 7.9 +/- 0.2 Gy). Tissues with recovery half-times similar to or longer than that determined for skin would be at risk if interfraction intervals less than 6 h are used in regimes which involve the use of two or more fractions per day. This would be especially true for tissues that show a greater sensitivity to dose fractionation, and hence more sparing of radiation damage with hyperfractionation.",Excluded,0.9326599
79,"Combination of EGFR/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibition by BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 with irradiation in FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of the dual EGFR/HER2 (ErbB2) tyrosine kinase inhibitors BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 on proliferation and clonogenic cell survival of FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma in vitro, and on tumor growth after single-dose irradiation in nude mice., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cell proliferation, cell-cycle distribution and clonogenic cell survival after irradiation were assayed with and without BIBW 2992 or BIBW 2669 (3, 30, and 300 nM) in vitro. Tumor volume and tumor growth delay (GD(V2)) were determined in tumors growing in NMRI (nu/nu) nude mice, treated with (a) BIBW 2992 (20 mg kg(-1) body weight orally), BIBW 2669 (3-4 mg kg(-1) body weight orally) or carrier until a final tumor diameter of 15 mm, or, (b) 3 days before a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation or, (c) after a 20-Gy single-dose irradiation until reaching the final tumor diameter., RESULTS: BIBW 2992 and BIBW 2669 significantly increased the doubling time of FaDu cells in vitro. A marked dose-dependent antiproliferative effect with blockade of the cells in G0/G1-phase of the cell cycle was found. Incubation with BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 for 3 days marginally increased radiosensitivity of FaDu cells in vitro. For BIBW 2992, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.006). Daily oral application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 in mice bearing unirradiated FaDu tumors showed a marked antiproliferative effect with a significant prolongation of tumor growth delay (p < 0.0001). After drug application for 3 days, followed by 20-Gy single-dose irradiation, a slight effect of both drugs on tumor growth delay was seen. For BIBW 2669, this effect was statistically significant (p = 0.007). However, this effect disappeared when tumor volumes were normalized to the time point of irradiation suggesting that both drugs showed no or only a slight radiosensitizing effect in vivo. Daily application of BIBW 2669 or BIBW 2992 after a single-dose irradiation showed a clear inhibition of tumor growth with a significantly longer tumor growth delay after drug treatment compared to control tumors (p < 0.002). Enhancement ratios were smaller for irradiated than for unirradiated tumors, suggesting an additive effect for combinations with radiotherapy. In all treatment arms, the effects of BIBW 2669 were not significantly different from BIBW 2992., CONCLUSION: BIBW 2669 and BIBW 2992 showed a clear antiproliferative effect in vitro, whereas radiosensitization was only marginal. The present data are the first to show an effect of combined irradiation and dual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibition on tumor growth delay in vivo. Further preclinical investigations using fractionated irradiation schedules and local tumor control as experimental endpoint are needed to evaluate a possible curative potential for the combination treatment.",Excluded,0.931648

Eight patients underwent nephrectomy and postoperative irradiation at a mean dose of 28 Gy, a marked radiation reaction was noted in 3 of them, and irradiation had to be discontinued. All 8 patients died within 3 yrs. of a follow-up period. Thirty patients received preoperative irradiation at a single focal dose of 2-2.5 Gy and a summary dose of 30-50 Gy 3-4 weeks before nephrectomy. A dose of 30 Gy did not result in tumor reduction, a dose of 40 Gy led to an insignificant reduction of a tumor size by 1-2 cm, tumor resorption by 30-50% was noted at doses of 50-60 Gy. Thirty-eight patients were given preoperative irradiation at a daily single focal dose of 4 Gy and a summary dose of 20 Gy, followed by nephrectomy in 24-48 h. Radiation reactions in preoperative irradiation were less marked than in postoperative irradiation.

269,"Late radiation side-effects in three patients undergoing parotid irradiation for benign disease We report three patients in whom standard radiation therapy was given and serious late radiation damage was seen. The first patient suffered recurrent parotiditis and a parotid fistula. He was treated initially with 20 Gy in ten fractions via a 300 kV field. Further irradiation was required 1 year later and 40 Gy was given in 2 Gy fractions by an oblique anterior and posterior wedged photon pair. Ten years later he developed localized temporal bone necrosis. The second patient, with pleomorphic salivary adenoma, developed localized temporal bone necrosis 6 years after 60 Gy had been given using standard fractionation and technique. The third patient received 55 Gy in 25 fractions for a pleomorphic salivary adenoma and after 3 years developed temporal bone necrosis. Sixteen years later the same patient developed cerebellar and brainstem necrosis. All patients developed chronic persistent infection during or shortly after the radiation therapy, which increased local tissue sensitivity to late radiation damage. As a result, severe bone, cerebellar and brainstem necrosis was observed at doses that are normally considered safe. We therefore strongly recommend that any infection in a proposed irradiated area should be treated aggressively, with surgical debridement if necessary, before radiotherapy is administered, or that infection developing during or after irradiation is treated promptly.",Excluded,0.91999656
658,"Radiation-related arterial disease Arterial occlusive disease has been recognized in association with radiation arteriopathy and, rarely, with spontaneous arterial disruption. This association results from the greater role of radiation therapy in the current management of malignant diseases coupled with longer patient survival and the lengthy latency period between radiation and clinical manifestations of radiation arteriopathy. Experience with six patients having radiation-associated arterial disease was retrospectively reviewed. There were four men and two women, with a mean age of 51 years (range, 36-74). Arteries exposed to radiation include two carotids, three subclavians, one coronary, and one femoral. The time from radiation therapy until clinical arterial disease was a mean of 14.3 years (range, 4-30). Operative repairs with polytetrafluoroethylene and saphenous vein bypass grafts were performed in four patients, stent placement in one patient, and one patient had spontaneous carotid disruption that ultimately was treated with ligation. In conclusion, elective bypass can be performed safely and successfully for arterial occlusive disease in a previously irradiated artery. In contrast, life-threatening arterial disruption secondary to radiation arteriopathy usually requires concomitant exposure to a source of bacterial contamination, and ligation may be the best choice to prevent recurrent hemorrhage.",Excluded,0.9166569
705,"Assessment of radiation-induced liver injury with computed tomography OBJECTIVE: To review the appearance of radiation-induced liver injury on computer tomography for quantitative assessment of dosimetric changes in different radiological reactions and the influence of time-effect. METHOD(S): The focal liver reactions of 35 patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3-D CRT) for liver malignancies were evaluated, with the applied doses of 36-65 Gy in 4-28 fractions completed in 8-41 days. All patients received nonenhanced CT scan and arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scan 1-6 months after therapy. The liver tissue density in irradiated and nonirradiated liver was compared, and the reaction type and the threshold dose determined radiologically. RESULT(S): On at least one follow-up examination, 51.4% of patients were found to have a focal radiation reaction in the liver. The radiation reaction was hypodense in 43.75% of the follow-up nonenhanced CT examinations and in 19.23% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. It was hyperdense in 42.31% of arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. The median threshold dose inducing a radiation reaction was 30.8 Gy (range 18-42.8 Gy). The detected threshold dose was positively correlated with the time of detection of the reaction (P=0.041), with a correlation coefficient of -0.473. On arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans, the threshold dose was significantly higher for hyperdense than for hypodense changes (P=0.017). In additional follow-up, the reaction volume decreased and the reaction types changed on arterial-dominant phase contrast-enhanced CT scans. CONCLUSION(S): The threshold dose can be different in different radiological reaction types on multiphase CT scans. The detected threshold dose is inversely correlated with the time of detection of the early reaction. Multiphase contrast-enhanced CT is helpful to distinguish radiation reactions from recurrent tumors.",Excluded,0.9151855
426,"Nasal mucociliary clearance after radiation therapy Irradiation has been demonstrated to cause decreased mucociliary clearance in animal models. We sought to verify this effect clinically by using the saccharin transport test to evaluate nasal mucociliary clearance in 9 patients previously treated with radiation therapy to the nasal cavity. The patients also completed a questionnaire examining the prevalence of nasal symptoms before and after radiation therapy. Patients who received radiation therapy had no clearance of saccharin from the nasal cavity at a minimum of 20 minutes. The controls had a median clearance time of 5 minutes. The patients noted a higher prevalence of nasal congestion, drainage, and facial pain after radiation therapy. This study demonstrates that radiation therapy to the nasal cavity causes a decrease in nasal mucociliary clearance.

80,"Fat mass and fracture risk in elderly men and women: A prospective study Background and Aim: The relationship between body fat mass and fracture risk is controversial, due primarily to lack of prospective data. The present study sought to examine the association between whole body and abdominal fat mass and fracture risk in postmenopausal women and elderly men. Materials and Methods : The present study was part of the ongoing Dubbo Osteoporosis Epidemiology Study (DOES), in which a random sample of more than 2000 men and women aged 60+ years has been continuously followed up for 21 years. The present study was based on a cohort of 1129 participants (361 men and 768 women), whose total body BMD scans were available. BMD at the femoral neck and lumbar spine, total body fat mass and abdominal fat mass were measured by DXA (GE-LUNAR Corp, Madison, WI). Baseline characteristics of participants including age, height, physical activity, history of falls, smoking and prior fracture were ascertained at the initial visit. The incidence of lowtrauma and nonpathological fractures was ascertained from x-ray reports. The Cox's proportional hazards regression was used to evaluate the association between fat mass and fracture risk, with adjustment for baseline covariates. Result(s): During the median 5 years of follow-up, 19 (5%) men and 107 (14%) women had sustained a fragility fracture. Women with fracture had lower BMD, lower body fat mass and body weight than those without a fracture. In women, increased risk of fracture was associated with lower abdominal fat mass (hazard ratio/ standard deviation[HR/SD]: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.07-1.65), after adjusting for age (HR/SD: 1.32; 1.08-1.63), femoral neck BMD (HR/SD:1.26; 1.03-1.56), and prior fracture (HR/SD:1.41; 1.15-1.73). Compared with women in the highest tertile of abdominal fat, those in the lowest tertile had a 2.1-fold (95% CI: 1.25-3.55) increase in fracture risk. Further analyses revealed that lower body fat mass was also associated with increased fracture risk, but the association was not independent of BMD. The magnitude of association between fat mass and fracture risk (HR/ SD: 1.32; 1.08-1.63) was greater than that of body weight and fracture risk (HR/SD: 1.15; 0.94-1.41). Approximately 27% of fracture liability was attributable to abdominal fat mass. Conclusion(s): Lower total body fat mass, particular lower abdominal fat, was significantly associated with increased fracture risk in women, not in men. These results suggest that the incorporation of fat mass into existing fracture prognostic models may enhance their predictive accuracy.",Excluded,0.91352063
832,"Production of androgenetic diploid loach by cold-shock of eggs fertilized with diploid sperm Diploid androgenotes were produced without egg irradiation in the loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus. Eggs of wild-type diploid females were fertilized with diploid sperm of a neo-tetraploid male and then cold-shock treated at 3 degreeC (range, +/-0.5 degreeC) for 30 minutes just after fertilization to eliminate the female nucleus. After hatching, ploidy status of the hatched larvae was analyzed by flow cytometry, which revealed putative diploid androgenotes as well as larvae possessing other ploidies. Five independent microsatellite DNA markers were genotyped to confirm all-male inheritance of the resultant diploid larvae. The mean +/- SD yield rate of diploid androgenetic larvae to total eggs used was 12.29 +/- 3.25% in the cold-shock group and 22.23 +/- 13.42% in the UV-irradiated group (P > 0.05). No diploid androgenetic larvae were detected in the intact control group.

971,"Expression of transforming growth factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factors A and B in oropharyngeal cancers treated by curative radiation therapy Background and purpose: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in cellular responses to ionizing radiation and represents a major target for current radiosensitizing strategies. We wished to ascertain whether a correlation existed between the expression of EGFR, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGFalpha) and platelet-derived growth factors A and B (PDGF-A and PDGF-B) and treatment outcome in a group of patients with oropharyngeal cancer who had undergone curative radiation therapy. We also assessed the relationship existing between each of the aforementioned proteins and intratumoral microvessel densities (IMD) which have been previously reported (Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2000;48:17-25. Material(s) and Method(s): Pretherapeutic tumor biopsies from 95 patients were immunohistochemically stained and their immunoreactivities evaluated semi-quantitatively. The statistical analyses included Cox regression for calculating risk ratios of survival endpoints and logistic regression for determining odds ratios for the development of distant metastasis. Result(s): Local tumor control as well as disease-free and overall survival were independent of protein expression levels, whereas combined TGFalpha and EGFR immunoreactivities were closely related to IMD (P=0.003). The expression levels of these two proteins were also correlated to each other (P=0.015). Expression of PDGF-B occurred in 54% of cases and was associated with an increase in the risk of developing distant metastasis (P=0.011). Conclusion(s): Tumoral levels of TGFalpha, EGFR and PDGF-A/B are not predictive of radioresponsiveness in oropharyngeal cancers. The association between IMD and immunoreactivity for TGFalpha and EGFR indicates the involvement of these proteins in the promotion of angiogenesis in these tumors. PDGF-B should be further evaluated as a prognostic marker for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.",Excluded,0.89930594
663,"Staff radiation dose and estimated risk in an interventional radiology department In interventional radiology attendant staff can be exposed to significant doses from the radiation scattered from the patient, giving rise to heterogeneous energy distribution, exposure occurring over extended periods of time. Protection of staff is a prime concern, also including reducing the risk of carcinogenesis. With only limited published studies available, as in for instance in regard to lens opacifications, further evaluation of staff exposures and assessment of radiation protection techniques and measures are crucial. Present study has sought to evaluate staff radiation exposure in a radiology department that performs interventional procedures. Annual occupational exposures were obtained for 32 personnel (6 females and 26 males) in a radiology department at a tertiary hospital. Personal dose equivalent Hp (d) was measured in terms of Hp (0.07) (shallow dose) and Hp (10) (deep dose). The measurements were made over a period of two consecutive years, 2017 and 2018, use being made of TLD-100 thermoluminescent dosimeters. In units of mSv, the corresponding average annual dose equivalent and range for Hp (10) and Hp (0.07) were 4.6 +/- 7.0 (0.1-25.5) and 5.1 +/- 7.3 (0.1-25.5). Notably, 16% of staff received doses that were greater than the annual dose limit. Since Hp (10) offers a conservative evaluation of effective dose, evaluation of the working environment is necessary in seeking to ensure dose values remain below annual dose limits.Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Excluded,0.8892908
0,Efficacy of radiation therapy for the treatment of macroscopic canine oral soft tissue sarcoma This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of radiotherapy used alone in macroscopic oral soft tissue sarcoma. Thirty-one dogs qualified for the study. Twenty dogs received curative radiotherapy (median total dose: 52.5 Gy) and eleven dogs were treated palliatively (3 x 8 Gy or 5 x 6 Gy). The time-to-progression for the curatively-treated dogs was 333 days versus 180 days for the palliatively-treated dogs (p=0.134). The overall survival was 331 days for the curative group and 310 days for the palliative group (p=0.2292). The results of this study suggest that radiation therapy is useful in the treatment of oral soft tissue sarcoma.,Excluded,0.8877956
939,"Enhancement of synaptic strength in the somatosensory cortex following nerve injury does not parallel behavioural alterations Following infraorbital nerve transection, underlying mechanisms of the altered synaptic strength were studied in rat barrel cortex slice experiments. In addition to the in vitro electrophysiological studies, open-field tests were run to detect possible behavioural changes associated with cortical oversensitization. Enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated component of the evoked field response appeared in the barrel cortex after nerve injury. The alteration was transient, very distinct on the first day following injury, and almost returned to normal level by the end of the second week. Behavioural changes had not followed this time-course since long-lasting alterations were detected in the open-field test. These observations are in agreement with findings that showed biphasic regenerative processes following nerve injuries in other cortical areas.",Excluded,0.84620726
241,"Towards the control of chikungunya vector in la Reunion using the sterile insect technique: Sexual competitiveness and mating success of sterilized males Aedes albopictus The sterile insect technique (SIT) is widely used as part of area-wide integrated pest management programs for insects such as fruit fies, screw-worm fies and tsetse fies. It is based on the releases of large numbers of sterile males, which transfer their sterile sperm to wild females for the fertilization of the eggs, resulting in embryonic death. The lack of offspring could then lead to a decrease of the wild population density. The SIT is currently being developed at the FAO/IAEA in Vienna and on La Reunion, France, for the potential control of Aedes albopictus, vector of Chikungunya and secondary vector of Dengue viruses. In this context, we investigated the impact of the sterilisation process on male mating success and sexual competitiveness in the laboratory and under semi-feld conditions. Males from a young laboratory colony (F4) were irradiated as pupae (>20h old) with gamma-rays at 35 or 40 Gy. In the laboratory, the time for male sexual maturation was not affected by the irradiation, neither was the insemination rate of 4 days old males as compared to un-irradiated ones. The daily individual mating success of sterile males during 15 days was reduced as compared to un-irradiated males; however the differences were signifcant only during the second week. Sterility was maintained over successive matings and after a resting period. Under semi-feld conditions, sterile males competed well against wild males, though a resting period of 5 days in the laboratory before release greatly improved their effciency. A ratio of fve sterile to one wild male resulted in a two-fold reduction of the wild females' mean fertility. Valuable information on the effects of the sterilization process was collected and it is suggested that an effcient reduction of a wild population might be achieved by releasing sterile males as adults. Moreover, the results indicate that a resting period allows a recovery from radiation-induced somatic damages which improved the biological quality of the males.",Excluded,0.8380728

Between 2005 and 2013, 22 patients with atypical meningiomas were treated to a median dose of 63 Gy (RBE) using proton therapy, as an adjuvant therapy after surgery (n = 12) or for recurrence or progression of residual tumor (n = 10). Six patients had presumed radiation-induced meningiomas, but none had received prior radiotherapy for their meningioma. The median follow-up time after radiation was 39 months (range 7-104) and all patients remain alive at last follow-up. The 5-year estimate of local control was 71.1 % (95 % CI 49.3-92.9 %). The 5-year estimate of local control was 87.5 % following a radiation dose >60 Gy (RBE), compared to 50.0 % for <=60 Gy (RBE) (p = 0.038). The 5-year estimate of neuraxis dissemination was 5 % (95 % CI 0-14.6 %) and 6.2 % (95 % CI 0-18.2 %) for metastases outside of the central nervous system. Radiation necrosis was observed in one patient with a history of prior cranial irradiation. Fractionated proton therapy was associated with favorable tumor control rates for grade 2 meningiomas.

High density of contrast enhancement observed in gliomas mainly corresponded to proliferation of irregular blood vessels and hypodensity reflected less cellular area or necrotic foci in the tumor tissue. A mottled lesion with high density margin in C-T of radionecrosis of the brain tissue observed in a non-glioma patient was formed by coagulation necrosis showing marked proliferation of telangiectatic blood vessels in periphery of lesion and acellular area in the center. It is occasionally impossible to differentiate the findings between delayed radionecrosis of brain and recurrence of glioma using the C-T criteria alone.,Excluded,0.8255715
107,"Lymphocyte transformation to phytohaemagglutinin and delayed hypersensitivity related to age and previous cancer history Declining immunosurveillance in old age has been considered one possible explanation for the increased incidence of cancer in the elderly. This study was set up to search for evidence of persistent immunodeficiency in patients with a past history of cancer. Lymphocyte responses to phytohaemagglutinin and cutaneous delayed hypersensivity were assessed in fifty-seven elderly subjects who had successfully completed treatment for cancer more than 18 months previously and compared with those of forty-three healthy controls matched for age and sex. Although a significant difference between mean tritiated thymidine uptake was observed in the lymphocyte response to phytohaemagglutinin (cancer patients 1859 cpm, control 2502 cpm), this could be explained by an unexpectedly prolonged effect of radiotherapy. Mean counts for those twenty-six cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within the period 18 months to 4 years were low (1257 cpm), but were normal (2366 cpm) for the remainder. A significant negative correlation of lymphocyte transformation with age was confirmed in both groups. There was no significant difference in cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity response to commonly encountered antigens. Whilst recognising that these tests do not comprehensively assess immune function, the present results provide no support for the theory that an age-related decline in immune function contributes to the heightened incidence of cancer in the elderly.",Excluded,0.82370865
866,"Bone Marrow Transplantation Induces Normoglycemia in a Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Murine Model Objective: To study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy, bone marrow-derived cells must be identified. The aim of this study was to obtain a diabetic chimeric model with bone marrow cells expressing enhanced green fluorecence protein (EGFP), without modifying the course of diabetic nephropathy. Material(s) and Method(s): Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed in an obese type 2 diabetic murine model (db/db) owing to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene. Whole bone marrow from female donor C57BL/6 EGFP+ mice was transplanted into 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and into 8- and 24-week-old female C57BLKS (db/db) EGFP- mice. Recipient mice received total body irradiation (TBI) followed by bone marrow (BM) cell infusion. We tested various irradiation doses (Gy) and numbers of BM cells. Result(s): When a low TBI dose and a small number of BM cells were administered, only syngeneic C57BL/6 mice became chimeric, whereas allogeneic db/db mice showed rejection. When Gy dose and BM cells were increased, db/db mice became chimeric. However, 8-week-old db/db mice lost the obese phenotype and became normoglycemic, probably due to peripheral BM cell infiltration. Conversely, 24-week-old db/db mice remained obese showing similar blood glucose values, body weights, albuminuria, and glomerular lesions at nontransplanted db/db mice. Conclusion(s): Recipient age greatly influenced the peripheral repopulation after BMT in db/db mice. Only the adult chimeric db/db mice seemed to be a good model to study the cellular mechanisms involved in the regression of diabetic nephropathy. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Twenty-six BDIX rats were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb syngeneic colon cancer cells in the right hind flank. Three weeks post-inoculation, the right leg of 12 rats bearing the tumor nodule was treated with BPA-BNCT (BPA-Boronophenylalanine) at the RA-3 nuclear reactor located in Buenos Aires, Argentina, at an absorbed dose of 7.5 Gy to skin as the dose-limiting tissue. The remaining group of 14 tumor-bearing rats were left untreated and used as control. Two weeks post-BNCT, 1 x 106 DHD/K12/TRb cells were injected subcutaneously in the contralateral left hind flank of each of the 26 BDIX rats. Tumor volume in both legs was measured weekly for 7 weeks to determine response to BNCT in the right leg and to assess a potential influence of BNCT in the right leg on tumor development in the left leg. Within the BNCT group, a statistically significant reduction was observed in contralateral left tumor volume in animals whose right leg tumor responded to BNCT (post-treatment/pre-treatment tumor volume <1) versus animals who failed to respond (post/pre >=1), i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 271 +/- 128 mm3. In addition, a statistically significant reduction in contralateral left leg tumor volume was observed in BNCT-responsive animals (post/pre <1) vs untreated animals, i.e., 13 +/- 15 vs 254 +/- 251 mm3.

226,"In vitro activation of the in vivo colony-forming units of the mouse yolk sac Experiments were performed to investigate the presence of colony-forming units (CFU) in the mouse embryonic yolk sac during the developmental period in which the yolk sac is the sole hemopoietic organ. Injection of yolk sac cell suspensions from normal embryos into syngeneic, lethally irradiated adult recipients evoked a very low number of spleen colonies. However, prior cultivation of yolk sacs in vitro caused a dramatic increase in the spleen colony-forming capacity--as high as 84-fold--following 48 hours in culture. The yolk sac origin of the spleen colonies was confirmed by: (a) Chromosomal marker analysis; (b) dose-response analysis; (c) demonstrating that the above colonies were not of endogenous origin induced by the mere injection of grafted cells.

902,"Curative stereotactic body radiotherapy for liver malignancy Nine patients with 11 primary or secondary liver non-neuroendocrine malignancies with mean and maximum diameters of 4.0 and 7.7 cm became long-term survivors after precision irradiation in a stereotactic body frame. Doses varied from 20 to 45 Gy split at 2-4 occasions a few days apart, with higher doses in the target centers. Occasional chemotherapy was stopped well before irradiation. No hospitalizations were needed because side effects, regional pain and nausea, were mild. All patients have now survived 5-14 years without recurrences. Two verified and one suspected secondary cancers occurred in organs close to the irradiated targets, and two of them could be resected for cure. Precision irradiation can thus cure selected liver malignancies. It is the first non-invasive method to achieve this, and the present patients are its first long-term survivors. A prolonged follow-up period is, however, necessary, because we have in other patients seen local tumor regrowth as late as four years after irradiation. The approach may cure some tumors, which are technically unsuited for other treatment modalities, and can be used for patients at high surgical risk. The success rate for local control seems good, but has to be defined by formal studies after optimization of radiation doses. © 2008 Humana Press Inc.",Excluded,0.79845315
572,"Pten regulates Aurora-A and cooperates with Fbxw7 in modulating radiation-induced tumor development The Aurora-A kinase gene is frequently amplified and/or overexpressed in a variety of human cancers, leading to major efforts to develop therapeutic agents targeting this pathway. Here, we show that Aurora-A is targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the F-box protein FBXW7 in a process that is regulated by GSK3beta. Using a series of truncated Aurora-A proteins and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified distinct FBXW7 and GSK3beta-binding sites in Aurora-A. Mutation of critical residues in either site substantially disrupts degradation of Aurora-A. Furthermore, we show that loss of Pten results in the stabilization of Aurora-A by attenuating FBXW7-dependent degradation of Aurora-A through the AKT/GSK3beta pathway. Moreover, radiation-induced tumor latency is significantly shortened in Fbxw7(+/-)Pten(+/-) mice as compared with either Fbxw7(+/-) or Pten(+/-) mice, indicating that Fbxw7 and Pten appear to cooperate in suppressing tumorigenesis. Our results establish a novel posttranslational regulatory network in which the Pten and Fbxw7 pathways appear to converge on the regulation of Aurora-A level.

Uneven distribution of the dosage is provided by using a grid diaphragm and conducting gamma-therapy only from one static field during the whole course of irradiation. This pattern of radiotherapy is shown to increase radioresistance of normal tissues and allows 1.5--4 times large focal dose to be applied to tumor compared with gamma-therapy via moving lead strips, thus rendering an enhanced antitumor effect of radiation.

Excluding four patients lost to follow-up, 112 with three-staged treatment and 189 with post-operative irradiation, 2966 who underwent a single-session of SRS only as radical irradiation were studied., RESULTS: The overall median survival time after SRS was 7.8 (95% CI; 7.4-8.1) months. Post-SRS complications occurred in 86 patients (2.9%) 1.9-211.4 (median; 24.0, IQR; 12.0-64.6) months after treatment. RTOG neurotoxicity grades were 2, 3 and 4 in 58, 25 and 3 patients, respectively.

Both reagents labeled all TDL from rats of the DA strain (Ig-1a) with two categories of cells being detected; one binding 100-2,000 molecules of antibody, the other 10,000-100,000 molecules. These categories were likely to be synonomous with T and B cells, respectively. The [(125)I]antiallotype antibodies did not bind to TDL from rats of the PVG/c strain (Ig-1b). When the binding to TDL from (PVG/c x DA)F(1) animals was studied it was found that allelic exclusion occurred in the heavily labeled cells, but not in the lightly labeled ones. Furthermore, when lymphocytes of one allotype were transferred to irradiated recipients of the opposite allotype and recovered from the TDL or spleen of the recipient 20-30 h later, the immunoglobulin on heavily labeled cells was of the donor type, while that of lightly labeled ones bore the recipient marker. Thus heavily labeled cells (B lymphocytes) had synthesized their own immunoglobulin while lightly labeled cells (T lymphocytes) had acquired theirs passively by adsorption. The class of immunoglobulin on lightly labeled cells was also studied and it was found that [(125)I]anti-IgM antibodies bound to an extent approaching the [(125)I]anti-Fab binding, while [(125)I]anti-IgG(2a+2b) antibodies gave much less binding.",Excluded,0.7609789
461,"How effective are lead-rubber aprons in protecting radiosensitive organs from secondary ionizing radiation? Introduction: The purpose of this experiment was to explore the direction of scattered secondary ionizing radiation to a patient. A left lateral radiographic examination of the elbow was deemed appropriate due to its close proximity to radiosensitive organs and record dose limiting opportunities upon wearing a lead-rubber apron. Method(s): An anthropomorphic phantom and lead-rubber apron (Pb 0.35 mm) was used with a 15 cc ionization chamber (model 10,100 AT TRIAD) to measure scattered radiation to radiosensitive organs. Dose readings were recorded before and after in order to quantify dose reduction. Pearson's correlation, linear regression, t-test and one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics were used to affirm how likely dose limitation was attributed to chance (p < 0.05). Result(s): The lead-rubber apron offered dose reduction to most radiosensitive organs. Notably, ionizing radiation was significantly reduced to the left breast 0.0083 muGy (98%), right breast 0.0000 muGy (99.9%) and spleen 0.0262 muGy (99.9%). No empirical benefit was recorded for testes and ovaries. Interestingly, the thyroid recorded an increase in dose (0.1733 muGy; p = 0.01). This was later mitigated using a thyroid collar but identifies increased stochastic risks if lead-aprons are worn alone. Scattered radiation was also reduced to both eyes, which were not directly covered. Conclusion(s): Lead-rubber aprons are generally utilized to limit ionizing radiation, yet this article offers insight whereby increases to ionizing radiation to the thyroid are plausible when wearing a lead-rubber apron alone. Whilst these findings cannot be generalized to other radiographic examinations it provides insight into a potential increase risk of scatter to a radiosensitive organ. Implications for practice: This paper has implications because it identifies that lead-rubber has an impact on scattered ionizing radiation to radiosensitive organs for a lateral elbow examination. Further, it identifies the potential for ionizing radiation to be increased to the thyroid upon wearing a lead-rubber apron alone. Copyright © 2020 The College of Radiographers",Excluded,0.75151926

Methods and Materials: LS-SCLC patients that had been treated with chemoradiotherapy between 1997 and 2007 at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital were reviewed in this study. Of the 127 eligible patients, there were 37 patients in the AHF group, 29 in the SF <54 Gy group, and 61 in the SF >=54 Gy group. Result(s): Fifty-five patients (43%) were alive at the time of this analysis, and the median follow-up time of the surviving patients was 33 months. The median survival times were 30.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 16.3-43.7) for the AHF group, 14.0 months (CI 6.6-21.4) for the SF <54 Gy group, and 41.0 months (CI 33.9-48.1) for the SF >= 54 Gy group. As for the local control rates, and the overall and progression-free survival rates, all outcomes were significantly lower in the SF <54 Gy group than in the other two groups, although no significant difference was found between the AHF and SF >=54 Gy groups.

Despite several factors such as ionizing radiation exposure or rare genetic syndromes have been associated with the development of glioblastoma, no underlying cause has been identified for the majority of cases. We thus aimed to investigate the role of DNA repair polymorphisms in modulating glioblastoma risk., METHODS: Genotypic and allelic frequencies of seven common polymorphisms in DNA repair genes involved in nucleotide excision repair (ERCC1 rs11615, ERCC2 rs13181, ERCC6 rs4253079), base excision repair (APEX1 rs1130409, XRCC1 rs25487), double-strand break repair (XRCC3 rs861539) and mismatch repair (MLH1 rs1800734) pathways were analyzed in 115 glioblastoma patients and 200 healthy controls. Haplotype analysis was also performed for ERCC1 rs11615 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms, located on the same chromosomal region (19q13.32)., RESULTS: Our results indicated that carriers of the ERCC2 Gln/Gln genotype were associated with a lower glioblastoma risk (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.89; P=0.028), whereas carriers of the MLH1 AA genotype were associated with an increased risk of glioblastoma (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.09-9.06; P=0.034). Furthermore, the haplotype containing the C allele of ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphism and the T allele of ERCC1 rs11615 polymorphism was significantly associated with a protective effect of developing glioblastoma (OR=0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.71; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: These results pointed out that MLH1 rs1800734 and ERCC2 rs13181 polymorphisms might constitute glioblastoma susceptibility factors, and also suggested that the chromosomal region 19q could be important in glioblastoma pathogenesis.

A polyclonal antibody against purified PFK from Fasciola hepatica was affinity purified using recombinant PFR and used in combination with immunogold labelling to identify PFK by transmission electron microscopy in cryosections. In both adult worms and in schistosomula most immunogold label localized in the cytoplasmic syncytial region with less being found in the tegument. There was no significant PFK localization within or external to the outer membrane. Sera from mice immunized with recombinant S. mansoni PFK with Freund's adjuvant or alum plus rIL-12 demonstrated high titres of anti-PFK IgC, but no protection against cercarial infection. Sera from mice that were acutely or chronically infected or multiply exposed to irradiated cercariae did not recognize recombinant schistosome PFK in either Western blotting or ELISA. Similarly, sera from humans infected with S. mansoni did not recognize PFK. We conclude that in spite of the high immunogenicity of rPFK in mice, it is not a significant immunogen during the course of infection and does not confer protection from schistosomiasis. One main difference between PFK and the other 2 glycolytic enzymes seems to be the inaccessibility of PFK to the outside surface of the tegument.",Excluded,0.67720425
417,"[Radiation therapy of eyelid carcinomas] Forty patients with histologically verified tumors of the eyelid, partly being pretreated surgically, were irradiated and reexamined. The irradiations were performed with an apparatus for surface therapy using soft rays. The radiation quality was between 55 and 100 kV, the dose between 3000 and 6000 rd. The single doses amounted to 300 or 400 rd. The rate of recurrences after primary irradiation of basaliomas was 5,5%, the rate of recovery 94,5%. The patients who underwent primary operation show a distinctly increased rate of recurrences. The percentage of complications was small, amounting to 8%. Primary irradiation is recommended for the treatment of stages T1 and T2 of eyelid tumors, the percentage of recovery being high and the number of complications small. Advanced stages ought to be treated according to the site and infiltration of the tumor either by the telecaesium apparatus under conditions of semi-deep therapy with use of a lead satellite for protection of the cristalline lens and with following soft-ray therapy, or by primary operation followed by radiation therapy.",Excluded,0.6699849
480,"Evaluation of cancer tests of 1,3-butadiene using internal dose, genotoxic potency, and a multiplicative risk model In cancer tests with 1,3-butadiene (BD), the mouse is much more sensitive than the rat. This is considered to be related to the metabolism of BD to the epoxide metabolites, 1,2-epoxy-3-butene (EB), 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, and 1,2-epoxy-3,4-butanediol. This study evaluates whether the large difference in outcome in cancer tests with BD could be predicted quantitatively on the basis of the concentration over time in blood (AUC) of the epoxide metabolites, their mutagenic potency, and a multiplicative cancer risk model, which has earlier been used for ionizing radiation. Published data on hemoglobin adduct levels from inhalation experiments with BD were used for the estimation of the AUC of the epoxide metabolites in the cancer tests. The estimated AUC of the epoxides were then weighed together to a total genotoxic dose, by using the relative genotoxic potency of the respective epoxide inferred from in vitro hprt mutation assays using EB as standard. The tumor incidences predicted with the risk model on the basis of the total genotoxic dose correlated well with the earlier observed tumor incidences in the cancer tests. The total genotoxic dose that leads to a doubling of the tumor incidences was estimated to be the same in both species, 9 to 10 mmol/Lxh EB-equivalents. The study validates the applicability of the multiplicative cancer risk model to genotoxic chemicals. Furthermore, according to this evaluation, different epoxide metabolites are predominating cancer-initiating agents in the cancer tests with BD, the diepoxide in the mouse, and the monoepoxides in the rat.",Excluded,0.655022
454,"Residential radon exposure and lung cancer--an epidemiological study of Norwegian municipalities The study is based on a collaboration between the Cancer Registry of Norway, the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, and National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB, UK). The association between indoor radon exposure and lung cancer was studied in 427 municipalities. NRPB detectors were sent to 10,000 households, and 7,500 of the detectors were returned. Data from a nation-wide survey of smoking habits in 1964-1965 were available. Data on asbestos exposure were also used in a regression analysis. The reporting to the Cancer Registry of all new cases of cancer is fairly complete, as hospital departments and institutes of pathology are obliged to report all cancer cases. The histologically confirmed lung cancer cases were grouped into squamous-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and other or non-specified histological types. The age-adjusted rate of lung cancer by histological type was the dependent variable in the regression analysis. A consistent increase in incidence of lung cancer was seen with increasing tobacco consumption, but no positive trend could be shown with increasing radon exposure in the descriptive presentation of the data. In the regression analysis, however, the incidence of small-cell anaplastic lung tumors in females increased significantly with increasing radon exposure. When based on the regression coefficients, the fraction of lung cancers attributable to radon is about 2-4%. However, systematic errors cannot be excluded in an ecological study such as presented here.",Excluded,0.6534693
1112,"Cancer incidence among Danish Thorotrast-exposed patients BACKGROUND: Studies of groups of patients given injections of the alpha-emitting x-ray contrast medium Thorotrast may provide information on human alpha-ray carcinogenesis., PURPOSE: We re-established a formerly identified cohort of neurological patients receiving injections of Thorotrast for cerebral arteriography and assessed their incidence of cancer., METHODS: Using the national population register, the Danish Cancer Registry, and other registers, we determined the incidence of cancer among Thorotrast-injected patients. Incidence ratios were standardized to the general population and computed for different cancer sites., RESULTS: The cumulative risk for cancer at all sites (excluding brain tumors where the standardized incidence ratio [SIR] was 28) reached 86% 50 years after Thorotrast injection. SIR was greatly elevated at all sites except the brain and CNS (3.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.0-3.7), mainly because of liver cancers (SIR = 126) as well as leukemia (SIR = 10) for which a relationship was found between the time since injection and the estimated dose (but not the age at injection). Other sites with significantly increased risks of cancer included the gallbladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (SIR = 14), peritoneum (SIR = 8.6), sites of multiple myeloma (SIR = 4.6), metastatic sites (SIR = 12), and unspecified sites (SIR = 11). Cancers of the lung and breast also occurred in significant excess, but no relationship between SIR and volume of injected Thorotrast or time since injection was observed. Cancer risk was increased at most other sites, although this increase was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: Alpha radiation may account for the increased risk of tumors of the liver, gallbladder, and peritoneum as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma, whereas confounding factors most probably contribute to the increased risks at other sites.",Excluded,0.65081084
233,"Adjuvant radiochemotherapy of stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma: role of CEA and CA 19-9 BACKGROUND: This analysis was undertaken to evaluate the impact of pre-radiotherapy CEA and CA 19-9 values on clinical outcome of locally advanced rectal cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective data were collected from patients (n=203) with UICC stage II and III rectal adenocarcinomas, who underwent low anterior or abdominoperineal resection and received post-operative or pre-operative radiochemotherapy from January 1989 until July 2002. The rates of survival and distant and local recurrences were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazards (median follow-up 8 years). Multivariate analysis was used to assess the prognostic value of CEA and CA 19-9.
RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial rates for patients with normal (n =118) and elevated (n=88) CEA values were as follows: overall survival 62.4% and 32.0% (p<0.001), local control 73.5% and 55.0% (p=0.007), and absence of distant metastasis 83.3% and 88.0% (n.s.), respectively. Similar results were obtained for patients with normal (n=82) and elevated (n = 10) CA 19-9 values: overall survival 60.7% and 14.0% (p=0.007), local control 83.7% and 80.0% (n.s.), and absence of distant metastasis 64.9% and 75.0% (n.s.), respectively. After adjustment for TNM stage, sex, age, LDH, tumor site and grading, the elevation of CEA proved to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (relative risk of 1.01 per ng/ml, CI 1.002 - 1.01; p=0.005).
CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the prognostic value of pre-radiotherapy CEA and CA 19-9 in patients with stage II or III rectal carcinoma.",Excluded,0.6440493
985,"Cancer incidence in professional flight crew and air traffic control officers: disentangling the effect of occupational versus lifestyle exposures Flight crew are occupationally exposed to several potentially carcinogenic hazards; however, previous investigations have been hampered by lack of information on lifestyle exposures. The authors identified, through the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority medical records, a cohort of 16,329 flight crew and 3,165 air traffic control officers (ATCOs) and assembled data on their occupational and lifestyle exposures. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer incidence in each occupation to that of the general population; internal analyses were conducted by fitting Cox regression models. All-cancer incidence was 20-29% lower in each occupation than in the general population, mainly due to a lower incidence of smoking-related cancers [SIR (95% CI) = 0.33 (0.27-0.38) and 0.42 (0.28-0.60) for flight crew and ATCOs, respectively], consistent with their much lower prevalence of smoking. Skin melanoma rates were increased in both flight crew (SIR = 1.87; 95% CI = 1.45-2.38) and ATCOs (2.66; 1.55-4.25), with rates among the former increasing with increasing number of flight hours (p-trend = 0.02). However, internal analyses revealed no differences in skin melanoma rates between flight crew and ATCOs (hazard ratio: 0.78, 95% CI = 0.37-1.66) and identified skin that burns easily when exposed to sunlight (p = 0.001) and sunbathing to get a tan (p = 0.07) as the strongest risk predictors of skin melanoma in both occupations. The similar site-specific cancer risks between the two occupational groups argue against risks among flight crew being driven by occupation-specific exposures. The skin melanoma excess reflects sun-related behaviour rather than cosmic radiation exposure. Copyright © 2012 UICC.",Excluded,0.6310327
727,"Changes in posterior scleral collagen microstructure in canine eyes with an ADAMTS10 mutation PURPOSE: We aimed to characterize alterations in the posterior scleral collagen microstructure before detectable disease onset in a canine model of open-angle glaucoma caused by an ADAMTS10 mutation., METHODS: Collagen orientation, anisotropy degree (proportion of preferentially aligned collagen), and relative density were measured at 0.4 mm spatial resolution using synchrotron wide-angle X-ray scattering. For statistical evaluation of structure parameters, regional averages of the peripapillary and mid-posterior sclera were compared between ADAMTS10 mutant (affected) dogs (n = 3) and age-matched (carrier) controls (n = 3)., RESULTS: No marked differences in the general pattern of preferential collagen fibril orientation were noted between the control and affected dogs. The peripapillary sclera of all specimens featured strongly aligned circumferential collagen ringing the optic nerve head. Collagen anisotropy was significantly reduced in the mid-posterior sclera of the affected dogs (carrier: 0.27+/-0.11; affected: 0.24+/-0.10; p = 0.032) but was not statistically significantly different in the peripapillary sclera (carrier: 0.46+/-0.15; affected: 0.45+/-0.17; p = 0.68). Collagen density was statistically significantly reduced in the affected dogs for the mid-posterior sclera (carrier: 28.1+/-9.14; affected: 18.3+/-5.12; p<0.0001) and the peripapillary sclera (carrier: 34.6+/-9.34; affected: 21.1+/-6.97; p = 0.0002)., CONCLUSIONS: Significant alterations in the posterior scleral collagen microstructure are present before the onset of clinical glaucoma in ADAMTS10 mutant dogs. A reduction in fibrous collagen density is likely an important contributory factor in the previously reported mechanical weakening of the sclera in this model. Baseline scleral abnormalities have the potential to interact with intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations in determining the course of glaucoma progression in animal models of the disease, and potentially in human glaucoma.",Excluded,0.62939507
510,"Changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume and their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery during radiotherapy for head and neck cancer BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess changes in lateral dimensions of irradiated volume during head and neck cancer radiotherapy and to determine their impact on the accuracy of dose delivery., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral dimensions of irradiated volumes were measured in five predefined points prior to treatment and then bi-weekly. For each measurement, midline dose was calculated and verified using in vivo dosimetry. Early radiation reactions, patient weight changes and the need to modify radiotherapy accessories were also recorded. The study included 33 head and neck cancer patients irradiated using parallel opposed megavoltage fields., RESULTS: Body mass changes during radiotherapy ranged from -18 to +4 kg (median -5). Lateral dimension changes >5 mm (range -37 to +16) occurred in 32 patients (97%). For axis measurements, the degree of lateral dimension changes were correlated with treatment field size (P = 0.022) and degree of mucositis (P = 0.017). Axis doses calculated for changed dimensions varied from those prescribed by -2.5 to +6% (median +2%). Differences larger than 5% were present in 4.8% of calculations. In 17 patients (52%), radiotherapy accessories had to be modified during treatment. The need to modify radiotherapy accessories correlated with larger treatment portals (P = 0.004), more weight loss during treatment (P = 0.01) and higher initial N stage (P = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Changes of irradiated volume lateral dimensions during head and neck cancer radiotherapy may lead to considerable dose delivery inaccuracies. Watchful monitoring, corrections to calculated dose when changes observed are significant and radiotherapy accessories modification during the course of treatment are strongly recommended.",Excluded,0.61420864
672,"Thyroid and parathyroid function in long-term survivors of stem cell transplantation after 10-14Gy total body irradiation Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction are well described complications of irradiation to the neck. In this study we have evaluated the incidence of thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction in long term survivors of SCT attending a dedicated haematology/ endocrine follow-up clinic. All patients were transplanted for haematological malignancy and had total body irradiation (TBI) as part of their pre-transplant conditioning regimen. 76 patients (37 female) were investigated a median of 18 years post SCT (range 8-29). The median dose of TBI was 12Gy (range 10-14) given in conjunction with cyclophosphamide. 61 patients were treated for CML and 15 patients were treated for acute leukemia. 21 out of 76 patients (28%) developed hypothyroidism and there were no cases of hyperthyroidism. Among male patients the prevalence was 26% compared to <1% in normal populations. Among women the prevalence was 30% compared to a normal prevalence of 0.1-2%. The median time after SCT that hypothyroidism developed was 13 years but the range was wide at 4.5-24 years. None of our patients had laboratory evidence of hypoparathyroidism (low calcium with inappropriately non-elevated PTH). 16 patients had a raised PTH level. Of these, 12/16 had a calcium level in the lower end of the normal range (2.16-2.4 mmol/l) making primary hyperparathyroidism unlikely. The majority (11/12) of these patients had low vitamin D levels making secondary hyperparathyroidism the most likely diagnosis. Of four patients with elevated PTH and calcium levels >2.4 mmol/ l, none had convincing evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism. One patient had renal impairment and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism; a second was taking bendrofluazide; a third was vitamin D deficient. A fourth patient was hypocalciuric with a 24 hour urinary calcium/creatinine ratio <0.01; this excludes primary hyperparathyroidism and makes the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia likely. In summary, there was a high prevalence of hypothyroidism (28%) among our patients. Conversely there were no cases of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypoparathyroidism but longer follow up will be necessary to clarify the effect of these doses of TBI on parathyroid function. Secondary hyperparathyroidism was frequent, particularly in association with low vitamin D levels. We conclude that indefinite surveillance is needed to identify thyroid dysfunction after SCT and vitamin D levels should be part of routine annual follow up investigations.",Excluded,0.6050072

Method(s): Swiss albino mice were exposed to imidacloprid (22, 11 and 5.5 mg/kg/day) along with 3% gum acacia as vehicle control through oral route for 7, 14 and 28 days for SHA assay and for 28 days for DLT. The epididymal sperm smear in 1% eosin stain was analyzed for SHAs. In DLT, male mice were allowed to mate with females after 1, 3 and 6 weeks of end of pesticide treatment. The uterine contents of the sacrificed females were observed for live and dead implants. The analysis of test and control groups data was done by one way ANOVA at p < 0.05. Result(s): Exposure of all dose levels of imidacloprid (22, 11 and 5.5 mg/kg/day) for seven days did not induce significant SHAs while they induced significant SHAs compared with the control group following exposure for 14 and 28 days. The analysis of uterine content revealed a significant increase in the number of dead implants/female compared with the vehicle control in only those females which were mated with male mice after six weeks of treatment of highest dose level of imidacloprid. The dominant lethal mutations were observed only at spermatogonial stage. Conclusion(s): Long-term exposure of pesticide generated SHAs even at lowest dose level (5.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days) and mutagenic effects at spermatogonial stage at highest dose level (22 mg/kg/day for 28 days).

243,"Hepatic irradiation augments engraftment of donor cells following hepatocyte transplantation Engraftment of donor hepatocytes is a critical step that determines the success of hepatocyte transplantation. Rapid and efficient integration of donor cells would enable prompt liver repopulation of these cells in response to selective proliferative stimuli offered by a preparative regimen. We have earlier demonstrated that hepatic irradiation (HIR) in combination with a variety of hepatotrophic growth signals, such as partial hepatectomy and hepatocyte growth factor, can be used as a preparative regimen for liver repopulation of transplanted hepatocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of HIR on engraftment of transplanted dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-positive hepatocytes in congeneic DPPIV-deficient rats. HIR-induced apoptosis of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC) within 6 hours of HIR resulted in dehiscence of the SEC lining in 24 hours. Although there was no change of the number of Kupffer cells after HIR, colloidal carbon clearance decreased 24 hours post HIR, indicating a suppression of phagocytic function. DPPIV + donor cells were transplanted 24 hours after HIR (0-50 Gy). There was an HIR dose-dependent increase in the donor hepatocyte mass engrafted in the liver parenchyma. The number of viable transplanted hepatocytes present in hepatic sinusoids or integrated in the parenchyma was greater in the HIR-treated group at 3 and 7 days after transplantation compared with the sham controls. Finally, we validated these rodent studies in cynomolgus monkeys, demonstrating that a single 10-Gy dose of HIR was sufficient to enhance engraftment of donor porcine hepatocytes. These data indicate that transient disruption of the SEC barrier and inhibition of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells by HIR enhances hepatocyte engraftment and the integrated donor cell mass. Thus, preparative HIR could be potentially useful to augment hepatocyte transplantation. Copyright © 2008 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",Excluded,0.5870296

RP events were retrospectively scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify clinical variables and genotypes associated with risk of RP of grades >=2 and >=3 on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis esting., RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 21.4 months, the incidence of grade >=2 RP was 29% and grade >=3 RP was 14%. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical factors such as concurrent chemotherapy and consolidation docetaxel, and lung dosimetric parameters such as volume receiving greater than 20 Gy and mean lung dose, MTHFR genotype (rs1801131; AA versus AC/CC) was significantly associated with risk of grade >=2 RP (hazard ratio: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.76; P = .006, corrected P = .018) and grade >=3 RP (hazard ratio: 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.70; P = .01; corrected P = .03).

433,"Resection status, age and nodal involvement determine survival among patients receiving adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma Context Pancreas cancer can potentially be cured by resection, but the role of adjuvant chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation has been controversial. Objectives To better define clinicopathological factors that may serve as predictive and/or prognostic variables. Patients Between 1984 and 2006, we retrospectively analyzed 91 patients with pancreas cancer treated with pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy followed by adjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiation at the University of Pennsylvania. Final pathological coding including margin status was confirmed by a pathologist. Interventions Patients were treated with 48.6 to 63.0 Gy, and 96.7% completed their prescribed radiation dose. Main outcome measures The prognostic significance of demographic factors, stage, year of surgery, tumor location, grade, resection status, and number of positive lymph nodes on overall survival were examined. Results With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the overall median survival was 2.3 years (95% CI 1.5-3.2 years), and the 5-year overall survival was 28.9%. In multivariate analysis, completeness of resection (P<0.001), fewer number of positive lymph nodes (0 vs. 1-2 vs. 3 or more) (P=0.004), and age less than, or equal to, 60 years (P=0.006) were all independently associated with improved overall survival. The overall survival reported in this study compares favorably with the results of other single-institution studies and with the RTOG 97-04 trial. Conclusions Adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiation following radical pancreatectomy can be delivered safely and results in comparatively good overall survival. The results of this analysis underscore the importance of resection status, number of involved lymph nodes and patient age as prognostic characteristics.

618,[Stimulation of the suppressor activity in relation to hematopoietic cells in the mouse thymus as affected by pertussis vaccine] After a single intraperitoneal injection of formalinized whole-cell pertussis vaccine 5374 into CBA mice a drastic depletion of cells in the thymus accompanied by the enhancement of suppressor T-cells production is observed. T-cells inhibit the endogenous and exogenous colony-formation in the spleen by hematopoietic stem cells (CFUs). Treatment of thymus cells with the anti-I-Jk alloantiserum against a specific marker of suppressor T-cells in the presence of complement removes the inhibitory effect on CFUs proliferation and has a stimulatory action on the capacity of the marrow CFUs to form macroscopic hematopoietic colonies in the spleen compared with control ones.

535,"The value of clinical prognostic factors for survival in patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer The aim of the study was to evaluate the value of clinical prognostic factors for survival of patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Material and methods. A total of 115 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer were analyzed. Twenty-three patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer (pT2-T4) were treated according to the protocol of a prospective clinical study. In all the cases, transurethral resection was followed by radiation and chemotherapy. A total dose of 54-60 Gy of radiotherapy was delivered by daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy each. Simultaneous chemotherapy was started on the same day as radiotherapy; gemcitabine at a dose of 175-300 mg/m2 was delivered once a week intravenously for 6 weeks. Individual patient data was analyzed in a retrospective part of the study. Radical cystectomy was performed to 46 patients with invasive urinary bladder cancer, and radiotherapy was delivered to 46 patients. Inclusion criteria for patients into a prospective or retrospective trial were equal. We evaluated a prognostic value of various clinical factors for patients treated with radical cystectomy, chemoradiation with gemcitabine, and radiation alone. Results. The 3-year overall survival in the cystectomy group was 51.1%, in the chemoradiation group 38.0%, and in the radiotherapy group 26.9% (P=0.001). In univariate analysis in the chemoradiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival (P=0.03). In the radiation group, completion of treatment according to the protocol showed a significant influence on overall survival too (P=0.01). In the radical cystectomy group, an important factor was a complete or incomplete TUR (P=0.02). Multivariate analysis showed a significance of hydronephrosis (P=0.03) and T stage (P=0.04) in the radiation therapy group. Comorbidity was found to be an independent prognostic factors in the chemoradiation group (P=0.02). Conclusions. The best 3-year overall survival was in the radical cystectomy group. Chemoradiation with gemcitabine could be offered as an alternative to patients refusing cystectomy.

Little has been published about this neoplasm with regard to clinical features and outcome in dogs. This retrospective study included 193 dogs from a single institution histopathologically diagnosed with SCC of the dermis. Thirty-eight percent of all dogs had documented histopathologic actinic change. The overall median survival time was 1004 days, with the population demonstrating actinic change associated with a significantly longer survival time (median 1359 days, range 16-3530 days) compared to dogs without actinic change (median 680 days, range 16-3066 days) and this achieved significance on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 0.42, 95% confidence interval 0.193-0.930, P = 0.032). These data demonstrate increased survival of dogs with SCC demonstrating actinic change over those with non-actinic SCCs, and purports long-term survival for these animals. Dogs received a variety of treatment approaches as a retrospective study, and future prospective studies will be necessary to investigate whether adjunct therapies such as radiation or chemotherapy offer improvement in survival for dermal SCC in the dog.

307,"Skin aging induced by ultraviolet exposure and tobacco smoking: evidence from epidemiological and molecular studies BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking, similar to ultraviolet (UV) A radiation exposure, has previously been identified as an important factor contributing to premature aging of human skin., OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: To investigate the relationship between these two environmental factors, we have conducted a cross-sectional study of 83 subjects (48 males, 35 females, age range 23-95), in which sun exposure, pack-years of smoking history and potential confounding variables were assessed by questionnaire. Facial wrinkles were quantified using the Daniell score. In order to study the molecular mechanism by which smoking caused wrinkle formation, in vitro studies were conducted to assess the alteration of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) mRNA expression in human fibroblasts stimulated with tobacco smoke extract or/and UVA., RESULTS: Logistic statistic analysis of the data revealed that age [odds ratio (OR)=7.5, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.87-30.161, pack-years (OR=5.8, 95% CI=1.72-19.87), and sun exposure (OR=2.65, 95% CI=1.0-7.0) independently contributed to facial wrinkle formation. When excessive sun exposure (>2 h/day) and heavy smoking (35 pack-years) occurred together, the risk for developing wrinkles was 11.4 times higher than that of non-smokers and those with less sun exposure (<2 h/day) at the same age. The in vitro studies revealed that MMP-1 expression was significantly increased in fibroblasts after the stimulation with either tobacco smoke extract or UVA. Maximum induction was observed when cells were treated with tobacco smoke extract plus UVA, indicating that the two factors act in an additive manner. MMP-1 induction was significantly higher in the low glutathione (GSH) content fibroblast compared to that in the high GSH fibroblast, indicating that the differences in glutathione content define the susceptibility of fibroblasts towards UV- or tobacco smoking-induced MMP-1 expression., CONCLUSION: Tobacco smoke and UVA cause wrinkle formation independently of each other. We propose that both factors cause aging of human skin through additive induction of MMP-1 expression.",Excluded,0.52523166
645,"Dna damage and repair: Fruit and vegetable effects in a feeding trial Epidemiologic studies have examined the association between fruit and vegetable (F&V) consumption and the risk of cancer. Several cancer-preventive mechanisms have been proposed, such as antioxidant properties and modulation of biotransformation enzyme activities; both may be associated with reducing DNA damage and hence the mutation rate. We investigated, in a randomized, controlled, crossover feeding trial, the effect of 10 servings/day of botanically defined F&V for 2 wk on endogenous DNA damage; resistance to gamma-irradiation damage; and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes, measured by the Comet assay. We also explored the association between the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism and serum bilirubin concentrations and DNA damage and repair measures. Healthy men (n = 11) and women (n = 17), age 20 to 40 yr, provided blood samples at the end of each feeding period. Overall, F&V did not affect DNA damage and repair measures in lymphocytes. The number of UGT1A1*28 alleles was inversely associated with sensitivity to gamma-irradiation exposure and DNA repair capacity, but a biological mechanism to explain this association is unclear. A larger sample size is needed to investigate the association between bilirubin concentrations and endogenous DNA damage. With inconsistent findings in the literature, additional dietary intervention studies on the effect of F&V on DNA damage and repair are needed.

1021,"An essential role for Drosophila hus1 in somatic and meiotic DNA damage responses The checkpoint proteins Rad9, Rad1 and Hus1 form a clamp-like complex which plays a central role in the DNA-damage-induced checkpoint response. Here we address the function of the 9-1-1 complex in Drosophila. We decided to focus our analysis on the meiotic and somatic requirements of hus1. For that purpose, we created a null allele of hus1 by imprecise excision of a P element found 2 kb from the 3' of the hus1 gene. We found that hus1 mutant flies are viable, but the females are sterile. We determined that hus1 mutant flies are sensitive to hydroxyurea and methyl methanesulfonate but not to X-rays, suggesting that hus1 is required for the activation of an S-phase checkpoint. We also found that hus1 is not required for the G2-M checkpoint and for post-irradiation induction of apoptosis. We subsequently studied the role of hus1 in activation of the meiotic checkpoint and found that the hus1 mutation suppresses the dorsal-ventral pattering defects caused by mutants in DNA repair enzymes. Interestingly, we found that the hus1 mutant exhibits similar oocyte nuclear defects as those produced by mutations in DNA repair enzymes. These results demonstrate that hus1 is essential for the activation of the meiotic checkpoint and that hus1 is also required for the organization of the oocyte DNA, a function that might be independent of the meiotic checkpoint.",Excluded,0.5100418
863,"Skin cancer in heart transplant recipients: frequency and risk factor analysis BACKGROUND: The frequency of skin cancer is increased among organ transplant recipients, but the predisposing risk factors are controversial. It is also unclear whether heart transplant patients face an increased risk compared to recipients of other organs, e.g. kidney transplants., METHODS: We performed univariate and multivariate analysis of risk factors for skin cancer in 252 heart transplants and in a control series of 228 kidney transplants followed up at a single center. An extensive dermatologic examination was carried out; baseline features, type of immunosuppression, number of 3A rejection episodes, extent of sunlight exposure and skin type were recorded. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) included: age at transplantation, sex, skin type (Fitzpatrick's criteria), presence of solar keratosis, presence of warts, type of organ, sunlight exposure., RESULTS: During follow up skin cancer was more common among heart transplants (40, 16 %) than in kidney transplants (16, 7%, p = 0.004). The cumulative incidence of skin cancer by life table analysis increased from 16% after 5 years to 33% after 10 years in heart transplant patients and from 6% to 17% in kidney transplants (p 10000 hours (relative risk = 2.8), but not organ type were significant risk factors., CONCLUSION: Age at transplant, skin type and sunlight exposure, but not type of organ and type of immunosuppressive regimen, are associated with increased risk of skin cancer in heart transplantation.",Excluded,0.5089647
