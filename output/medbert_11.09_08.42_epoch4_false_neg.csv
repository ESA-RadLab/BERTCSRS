98,"Does Vacuum-assisted Closure Reduce the Risk of Wound Complications in Patients With Lower Extremity Sarcomas Treated With Preoperative Radiation? BACKGROUND: Although preoperative radiation followed by wide local excision yields excellent local control in soft tissue sarcomas, the risk of wound complications is reported to be higher compared with the incidence in patients who were administered postoperative radiation therapy. Vacuum (vac)-assisted closure may improve wound healing, but it is unknown whether vac-assisted closure during soft tissue sarcoma resection may reduce the risk of wound complications or impair local disease control., QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Does the use of a wound vac application at the time of soft tissue sarcoma resection reduce the risk of developing wound complications after lower extremity sarcoma resection? (2) Is vac-assisted closure associated with an increased risk of local relapse?, METHODS: From 2000 to 2016, 312 patients with stage I to III soft tissue sarcomas were treated. Of these, 123 were treated with preoperative radiation +/- chemotherapy followed by limb-sparing resection based on tumor location, size, grade, histology, and patient age. There was a minimum followup of 12 months. Radiation was delivered generally based on tumor size, grade, superficial versus deep nature, and proximity to neurovascular structures. Chemotherapy was administered in patients < 70 years old with high-grade tumors and tumors > 5 cm. Patient, demographic, and treatment variables, including incisional vac application and wound outcomes, were retrospectively evaluated. Incisional vac-assisted closure took place at the time of primary resection in 32% (46 of 123) of patients. Vac-assisted closure was considered when there was a concern for risk of external contamination such as instances in which fixation of adhesives would be difficult or regions where there was a high risk of contamination. Vac-assisted closure may have also been used in instances with increased wound tension at closure or with heightened concern for shearing on the wound such as buttock wounds. Ten patients were lost to followup, two in the vac group and eight in the non-vac group. Potential factors associated with wound complications were evaluated using Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis and logistic regression for multivariate analysis. Local recurrence-free survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier estimate., RESULTS: After taking into consideration factors such as tumor size, location, age, and patient comorbidities, it was shown that patients who underwent vac-assisted closure were less likely to experience wound complications compared with patients who did not undergo vac-assisted closure (odds ratio, 0.129; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.041-0.398; p = 0.004). The local control incidence in the entire cohort was 98%. With the numbers available, Kaplan-Meier survivorship free from local recurrence did not differ between patients treated with or without the vac (100% [95% CI, 154.09-154.09] versus 96% [95% CI, 152.21-169.16]; p = 0.211), respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Vac-assisted closure at the time of resection of proximal lower extremity soft tissue sarcomas is associated with a lower risk of wound complications, and its use apparently did not compromise local control. We show that the use of vac-assisted closure may be worth considering in surgeons' attempts to reduce the risk of wound complications among patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the proximal lower extremities., LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, therapeutic study.",Included,0.083791286
874,"Curvature in the cancer mortality dose response in Japanese atomic bomb survivors: absence of evidence of threshold PURPOSES: To investigate the evidence for a threshold in the cancer dose-response curve., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese atomic bomb survivor cancer mortality data, based on follow-up to 1990, was used, taking account of random errors in DS86 dose estimates., RESULTS: For all solid cancers analysed together, there is a significant positive dose response (two-sided p<0.05) if all survivors who received <0.5 Sv are considered, but the significance vanishes if doses of <0.2 Sv are considered; the same is also true for leukaemia. For solid cancer mortality there is no indication of curvilinearity in the dose response: no statistically significant improvement in fit to a linear relative risk model is provided by addition of quadratic or threshold dose terms. If a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to solid cancer mortality data, the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.13). If a linear-quadratic-threshold model is used the best estimate of the threshold is < 0.00 Sv (95% CI < 0.00-0.15). For leukaemia mortality there is highly statistically significant upward curvature in the dose response. In particular, if a relative risk model with a threshold (the dose response is assumed linear above the threshold) is fitted to the leukaemia data, the best estimate of the threshold is 0.16 Sv (95% CI 0.05-0.40) (two-sided p=0.001 for test of departure of threshold from 0). However, there is no evidence for a threshold effect (two-sided p = 0.16) when a quadratic term is included in the dose response: the best estimate of threshold in this case is 0.09Sv (95% CI <0.00-0.29). Moreover, addition of a quadratic term improves the fit of a linear-threshold model at borderline levels of statistical significance (two-sided p = 0.07). Therefore, the most parsimonious description of the leukaemia dose response is provided by a linear-quadratic function of dose., CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence of threshold-type departures from the linear-quadratic dose response either for solid tumours or for leukaemia in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor mortality data.",Included,0.14550531
161,"Preclinical studies with the Faure high energy neutron facility: response of pig skin to fractionated doses of fast neutrons (66 MeVp----Be) The early and late responses of pig skin to fractionated doses of both unfiltered and filtered (i.e. hardened) neutrons using the Faure neutron therapy facility (66 MeVp----Be) were determined and compared with those following fractionated doses with 60Co gamma-rays. Dose-effect curves for the quantal responses of moist desquamation (early epithelial response) and dermal necrosis (late response) were fitted by probit analysis and ED50 values obtained. For a neutron fractionation scheme comprised of 12 fractions in 26 days, and using an unfiltered beam, the ED50 values for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis were 18.67 +/- 2.22 and 22.25 +/- 0.48 Gy, respectively, whereas in the case of the filtered beam, the corresponding ED50 values were 24.78 +/- 1.44 and 23.30 +/- 0.47 Gy. In order to provide a comparison, the values for 24 fractions of 60Co gamma-rays given in 39 days (a clinical protocol used in the Groote Schuur Hospital) were 74.02 +/- 2.92 and 66.72 +/- 1.93 Gy for moist desquamation and dermal necrosis, respectively. For the unfiltered beam, values for the comparative biological effectiveness (CBE) were 3.96 and 3.00 for the early and late skin response, respectively. The corresponding CBE values were for the filtered beam 2.99 and 2.86. These results for the Faure neutron therapy facility can be extrapolated to the human situation with a high degree of confidence, so that the neutron dose which would yield acceptable skin damage in patients may be determined using the data presented here.",Included,0.16158102
7,"A prospective quality of life study of patients with oral or pharyngeal carcinoma treated with external beam irradiation with or without brachytherapy The aim of this longitudinal quality of life (QL) study, was to study tumour-related symptoms and treatment side-effects of patients with oral or oropharyngeal cancer and to determine whether an increased local dose of irradiation (brachytherapy affected QL. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), a tumour-specific Head and Neck questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) were used repeatedly during 1 year. There were 105 patients, with a cumulative response rate of 89%. Most symptoms and problems were at their peak 2 or 3 months after the start of treatment. Nutrition and pain were found to be the major problems, and as many as 19-40% reported psychiatric distress. Patients having received additional brachytherapy did not report any increase in QL problems (except for pain) compared with those having had external radiation only. Quality of life does not seem to be affected by the increased irradiation local dose given when brachytherapy is included in the treatment regimen.",Included,0.18385349
9,"Decrease of respiratory burst in neutrophils of patients with ankylosing spondylitis by combined radon-hyperthermia treatment OBJECTIVE: To define the respiratory burst activity of neutrophils, the total anti-oxidative status of plasma, and the parameters of systemic inflammation in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) before and after a combined radon-hyperthermia treatment in the thermal tunnels of Bockstein-Bad Gastein in Austria., METHODS: In 20 patients with AS the effects of a total of 15 hours of radon-hyperthermia-treatment spread over a period of three weeks were studied. The respiratory burst activity of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, the total anti-oxidant status was measured using azinodiethyl-benzthiazoline-sulphonate, and inflammation parameters were determined by routine laboratory assays., RESULTS: Before treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 20) was 409 +/- 62 fluorescence arbitrary units (AU; mean +/- SEM) and 359 +/- 37 AU in controls (n = 9; p > 0.5); the stimulated respiratory burst (fMet-Leu-Phe, 10(-6) M) was 1,027 +/- 133 AU in patients and 1,152 +/- 218 AU in controls (p > 0.5). After treatment, the basal neutrophil respiratory burst in patients (n = 19) was 137 +/- 16 and in controls it was 174 +/- 35 AU (n = 8; p > 0.1); the stimulated respiratory burst was 670 +/- 66 and 1,305 +/- 82 AU, in patients and controls respectively (p < 0.001). No effects of treatment on the total anti-oxidant status of the plasma or on the parameters of inflammation were detected., CONCLUSION: Combined radon-hyperthermia treatment reduces the respiratory burst activity of the blood circulating neutrophils in patients with AS. If respiratory burst activity from the neutrophils plays a role in the pathophysiology of ankylosing spondylitis, the observed reduction may be related to the beneficial effects of radon-hyperthermia treatment.",Included,0.18989034
131,"A system for focal intracavitary irradiation of bladder cancer with remote iridium-192 afterloading An afterloading system for remote-control focal intracavitary irradiation of bladder cancer is presented. With 192Ir as radiation source, we demonstrated the practicability of the method in 23 chinchilla rabbits. A system for focal intracavitary irradiation of bladder cancer in humans was developed. A guiding tube with an inflatable balloon led to a reproducible vesical diameter. The intravesical part of the tube was shielded with lead and had a slit for focal radiation exposure. Three variant guiding tubes with different positions of the slit were designed to allow irradiation of any part of the bladder. The application is planned in patients with locally advanced tumors who refuse radical cystectomy or who are medically inoperable.",Included,0.21922326
529,"[Local recurrence of rectal cancers. Multidimensional analysis by anatomoclinical factors and role of irradiation] Pre- or postoperative radiation therapy reduces the incidence of local recurrence after surgical treatment of rectal carcinoma. Factors related to local recurrence were analyzed retrospectively by uni- and multivariate analysis. One hundred and fifty-five patients (mean age: 65 years) were operated on with curative intent between 1967 and 1984. Ninety-four patients (46 patients having abdominoperineal resections (APR), and 48 having anterior resections) did not receive radiation therapy. Sixty-one patients had preoperative radiation therapy followed by APR in 59 cases. Univariate analysis showed that the risk of local recurrence increased significantly with male sex (p less than 0.006), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), vascular invasion (p less than 0.02), and Astler-Coller classification (p less than 0.05). Tumor located at less than 5 cm from the anal verge was significantly related to recurrence only in patients not receiving radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). Multivariate analysis including therapeutic modalities showed that local recurrence was significantly related with male sex (p less than 0.02), positive lymph nodes (p less than 0.01), and distance to anal verge (p less than 0.01). The beneficial role of radiation therapy appeared only for tumors located 5 cm or less from the anal verge. Prognostic scores were established using these variables and the effect of irradiation was evaluated according to these scores. Radiation therapy significatively reduced the risk of local recurrence in low-risk patients, i.e., female with low-lying tumor and with negative lymph nodes (p less than 0.03).

4,"Should adjuvant radiotherapy be recommended following resection of regional lymph node metastases of malignant melanomas? Background: Several authors have recommended adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. There is, however, little evidence from controlled trials that patients benefit from this treatment. Objective(s): To evaluate the usefulness of adjuvant, radiotherapy following resection of lymph node metastases in cutaneous malignant melanoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective study comparing 58 patients who underwent radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases with 58 controls from another centre who exclusively underwent regional lymphadenectomy. Patients and their controls were matched with respect to the number of tumour-bearing lymph nodes (1 vs. 1) and to gender, although the proportion of thick tumours was greater in the irradiation group. Result(s): The overall survival curves were almost identical in the two groups. There were nine disease recurrences in the study group and 12 in the control group (not significant). Regional recurrences in the irradiated patients were usually accompanied by metastases at other sites. Conclusion(s): The present study does not support the recommendation of adjuvant radiotherapy following resection of regional lymph node metastases in patients with malignant melanoma.",Included,0.28472796
693,"Gamma irradiation. An effective procedure for bone banks, but does it make sense from an osteobiological perspective? BACKGROUND: Bone grafts promote bone healing by supplying a three-dimensional structure that supports bone ingrowth. Autologous bone therefore still remains the ""gold standard"" for grafts. Unfortunately, autologous bone grafts are associated with an increased morbidity. In order to avoid such problems, intensive research has been carried out on alternative materials such as allogeneic bone. However, its use is dependent on bone banks and its availability is limited. Gamma irradiation is now becoming established as a procedure for inactivating bacteria, fungal spores and viruses. Its effects on the biomechanical properties of bone have been analyzed in numerous studies. However, the current literature provides little information as to the effects of gamma sterilization on the osteobiology of allogeneic bone grafts., PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of gamma-sterilized bone grafts on immunocompetent cells by an in vitro model (a culture of human bone marrow cells)., METHODS: We decided to use the model of human bone marrow cells in culture for the in vitro analysis because the physiological conditions in the human body can best be simulated in this model and the observed reactions are applicable to humans., RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION: In sum, we found a maximum immune response in gamma-irradiated bone grafts, which, interpreted as a sole result, must be seen as a negative biological effect. However, in view of the good clinical results for gamma-sterilized bone grafts other influences would seem to be the determining factors in clinical outcome. Further research is needed to gain a more exact understanding of these factors.",Included,0.2899818

16,"Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for cutaneous radiation syndrome Systemic and local radiation injuries caused by nuclear power reactor accidents, therapeutic irradiation, or nuclear terrorism should be prevented or properly treated in order to improve wound management and save lives. Currently, regenerative surgical modalities should be attempted with temporal artificial dermis impregnated and sprayed with a local angiogenic factor such as basic fibroblast growth factor, and secondary reconstruction can be a candidate for demarcation and saving the donor morbidity. Human mesenchymal stem cells and adipose-derived stem cells, together with angiogenic and mitogenic factor of basic fibroblast growth factor and an artificial dermis, were applied over the excised irradiated skin defect and were tested for differentiation and local stimulation effects in the radiation-exposed wounds. The perforator flap and artificial dermal template with growth factor were successful for reconstruction in patients who were suffering from complex underlying disease. Patients were uneventfully treated with minimal morbidities. In the experiments, the hMSCs are strongly proliferative even after 20 Gy irradiation in vitro. In vivo, 4 Gy rat whole body irradiation demonstrated that sustained marrow stromal (mesenchymal stem) cells survived in the bone marrow. Immediate artificial dermis application impregnated with cells and the cytokine over the 20 Gy irradiated skin and soft tissues demonstrated the significantly improved fat angiogenesis, architected dermal reconstitution, and less inflammatory epidermal recovery. Detailed understanding of underlying diseases and rational reconstructive procedures brings about good outcomes for difficult irradiated wound healing. Adipose-derived stem cells are also implicated in the limited local injuries for short cell harvesting and processing time in the same subject.

564,"The maximum tolerated dose of gamma radiation to the optic nerve during gamma knife radiosurgery in an animal study BACKGROUND: The safety of gamma knife radiosurgery should be considered when treating pituitary adenomas., OBJECTIVES: To determine the maximum tolerated dose of radiation delivered by gamma knife radiosurgery to optic nerves., METHODS: An animal model designed to establish prolonged balloon compression of the optic chiasm and parasellar region was developed to mimic the optic nerve compression caused by pituitary adenomas. Twenty cats underwent surgery to place a balloon for compression effect and 20 cats in a sham operation group received microsurgery without any treatment. The effects of gamma knife irradiation at 10-13 Gy on normal (sham operation group) and compressed (optic nerve compression group) optic nerves were investigated by pattern visual evoked potential examination and histopathology., RESULTS: Gamma knife radiosurgery at 10 Gy had almost no effect. At 11 Gy, P100 latency was significantly prolonged and P100 amplitude was significantly decreased in compressed optic nerves, but there was little change in the normal optic nerves. Doses of 11 Gy and higher induced significant electrophysiological variations and degeneration of the myelin sheath and axons in both normal and compressed optic nerves., CONCLUSIONS: Compressed optic nerves are more sensitive to gamma knife radiosurgery than normal optic nerves. The minimum dose of gamma knife radiosurgery that causes radiation injury in normal optic nerves is 12 Gy; however, the minimum dose is 11 Gy in compressed optic nerves. Copyright © 2013 S.

11,"Initial evaluation of safety of wide-field irradiation in the treatment of hematopoietic neoplasia in the cat Localized radiation therapy is well tolerated in cats with confined tumors; however, the use of wide-field radiation therapy to treat disseminated neoplasia has not been evaluated systematically in this species. Wide-field external beam radiation therapy, which we define as irradiation of cranial or caudal halves of the body either individually or sequentially, was undertaken as an experimental option to treat cats with either chemotherapy-refractory or naive hematopoietic neoplasia considered to have a poor prognosis. Fifteen cats with hematopoietic malignancies received wide-field external beam radiation therapy between 2003 and 2006. Cats received 8Gy delivered in 4Gy fractions with 60Co photons. Treatment-related toxicity was scored according to criteria established by the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group. Animals without preexisting abnormalities on hemograms exhibited no or mild (Grade 1 or 2) hematopoietic toxicity. Although most cats (14 of 15) had preexisting gastrointestinal (GI) signs, these signs were stable (29%) or improved (42%) following irradiation. Worsening GI signs following irradiation occurred transiently in two cats and in association with progressive disease in two others. No pulmonary, renal, hepatic, or dermatologic toxicities were detected. In summary, wide-field external beam radiation therapy can be administered safely to, and may provide therapeutic benefit for, cats with disseminated hematopoietic neoplasia. © 2010 Veterinary Radiology & Ultrasound.",Included,0.4374096
64,"Radiation therapy in the treatment of partially resected meningiomas To address the question of whether radiation therapy is beneficial in the management of partially resected meningiomas, we reviewed the records of all patients admitted to the University of California, San Francisco, between 1968 and 1978 who had a diagnosis of intracranial meningioma. The patients were divided into three groups: 51 patients had gross total resection and did not receive radiation therapy, 30 patients had subtotal resection and no radiation therapy, and 54 patients had subtotal resection followed by radiation therapy. The subtotal resection groups were similar in average age, male:female ratio, and tumor location, which allowed a valid comparison of the effects of irradiation. The recurrence rate in the total resection group was 4% (2 of 51 patients). Among patients in the subtotal resection groups, 60% of nonirradiated patients had a recurrence, compared with only 32% of the irradiated patients. The median time to recurrence was significantly longer in the irradiated group than in the nonirradiated group (125 vs. 66 months, P less than 0.05). There was no complication related to irradiation.

558,"Apollo Lunar Astronauts Show Higher Cardiovascular Disease Mortality: Possible Deep Space Radiation Effects on the Vascular Endothelium As multiple spacefaring nations contemplate extended manned missions to Mars and the Moon, health risks could be elevated as travel goes beyond the Earth's protective magnetosphere into the more intense deep space radiation environment. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, accidents and all other causes of death differ in (1) astronauts who never flew orbital missions in space, (2) astronauts who flew only in low Earth orbit (LEO), and (3) Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere. Results show there were no differences in CVD mortality rate between non-flight (9%) and LEO (11%) astronauts. However, the CVD mortality rate among Apollo lunar astronauts (43%) was 4-5 times higher than in non-flight and LEO astronauts. To test a possible mechanistic basis for these findings, a secondary purpose was to determine the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. The results demonstrate that space-relevant irradiation induces a sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction. Such impairment is known to lead to occlusive artery disease, and may be an important risk factor for CVD among astronauts exposed to deep space radiation.",Included,0.46144333

254,"Diagnostic medical radiation in inflammatory bowel disease: Primum non-nocere? Background and Aims Patients with Inflammatory Bowel disease (IBD) are frequently exposed to diagnostic medical radiation for the diagnosis and evaluation of their disease. Despite increasing awareness of the potentially serious downstream effects, few studies have quantified radiation exposure in IBD patients. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 225 consecutive patients attending IBD clinics at our hospital. Clinical data including demographics, disease characteristics and therapy were obtained from case note and electronic patient record review. All incidences of diagnostic medical radiation from initial diagnosis until 30 June 2010 inclusive were recorded from case note and computerised radiology database system review. The radiation dose for each procedure was obtained from published tables from the Royal College of Radiologists, UK. Effective dose for each procedure was calculated by multiplying this value by the number of procedures during the study period. The sum of doses received was the cumulative effective dose. Results One hundred and two of the 225 IBD patients reviewed were female, 123 were male. The median age was 48 (Range 17-88) and mean disease duration 9.8 years. One hundred and four patients had Crohn's disease, 113 patients had ulcerative colitis and 8 patients had an indeterminate colitis. The mean and median cumulative effective radiation doses were 11.35 mSv and 5.12 mSv respectively. A cumulative radiation dose greater than 10 mSv was seen in 40.9% (92) patients and greater than 25 mSv in 12.9% (29) patients. In 9 patients the cumulative effective dose was greater than 50 mSv. Crohn's disease was associated with a higher cumulative effective dose with exposure exceeding 10 mSv in 60.6%, 25 mSv in 22.1% and 50 mSv in 8.7% patients respectively. CT imaging accounted for 43% and barium studies for 32% of the total cumulative effective dose exposure. Thirty-nine patients had small bowel magnetic resonance (MR) studies as an alternative to ionising radiation in the last 3 years. Conclusions Patients with IBD, particularly those with Crohn's disease are exposed to significant amounts of diagnostic medical radiation in their lifetime. The increased risk of cancer from cumulative radiation coupled with the inherent risk of colorectal malignancy in long standing IBD and the potential for immunomodulator drugs such as azathioprine to increase the risk of cancers (e.g. lymphoma) is of great clinical and public health concern. Clinicians must remain vigilant to these risks when evaluating these patients and radiation exposure should be minimised and when possible alternatives such as intestinal ultrasound and MR imaging should be preferred.",Included,0.48273146
